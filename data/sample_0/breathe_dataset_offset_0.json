The need for viral vectors has slowed down research and clinical use as their manufacturing and testing is lengthy and expensive. Genome editing brought the promise of specific and efficient insertion of large transgenes into target cells using homologydirected repair5,6. Here we developed a CRISPRCas9 genometargeting system that does not require viral vectors, allowing rapid and efficient insertion of large DNA sequences (greater than one kilobase) at specific sites in the genomes of primary human T cells, while preserving cell viability and function. This permits individual or multiplexed modification of endogenous genes. First, we applied this strategy to correct a pathogenic IL2RA mutation in cells from patients with monogenic autoimmune disease, and demonstrate improved signalling function. Second, we replaced the endogenous T cell receptor (TCR) locus with a new TCR that redirected T cells to a cancer antigen. The resulting TCRengineered T cells specifically recognized tumour antigens and mounted productive antitumour cell responses in vitro and in vivo. Together, these studies provide preclinical evidence that nonviral genome targeting can enable rapid and flexible experimental manipulation and therapeutic engineering of primary human immune cells. A nonviral strategy to introduce large DNA sequences into T cells enables the correction of a pathogenic mutation that causes autoimmunity, and the replacement of an endogenous Tcell receptor with an engineered receptor that can recognize cancer antigens.", "authors": "Theodore L.

These channels are composed of closely related paralogues of the leucinerich repeatcontaining protein 8 (LRRC8) family that coassemble to form hexameric complexes. Here, using cryoelectron microscopy and Xray crystallography, we determine the structure of a homomeric channel of the obligatory subunit LRRC8A. This protein conducts ions and has properties in common with endogenous heteromeric channels. Its modular structure consists of a transmembrane pore domain followed by a cytoplasmic leucinerich repeat domain. The transmembrane domain, which is structurally related to connexin proteins, is wide towards the cytoplasm but constricted on the outside by a structural unit that acts as a selectivity filter. An excess of basic residues in the filter and throughout the pore attracts anions by electrostatic interaction. Our work reveals the previously unknown architecture of volumeregulated anion channels and their mechanism of selective anion conduction.

The ultrafast modulation of the refractive index is, for example, crucial to optical modulators in photonic circuits. Silicon has emerged as a platform for integrating such compact circuits, but a strong Pockels effect is not available on silicon platforms. Here, we demonstrate a large electrooptical response in silicon photonic devices using barium titanate. We verify the Pockels effect to be the physical origin of the response, with r42  923 pm V1, by confirming key signatures of the Pockels effect in ferroelectrics: the electrooptic response exhibits a crystalline anisotropy, remains strong at high frequencies, and shows hysteresis on changing the electric field. We prove that the Pockels effect remains strong even in nanoscale devices, and show as a practical example data modulation up to 50 Gbit s1. We foresee that our work will enable novel device concepts with an application area largely extending beyond communication technologies.

However, the technology is still maturing, and the design elements for successful PROTACbased drugs are currently being elucidated. Importantly, fewer than 10 of the more than 600 E3 ubiquitin ligases have so far been exploited for targeted protein degradation, and expansion of knowledge in this area is a key opportunity. Here, we briefly discuss lessons learned about targeted protein degradation in chemical biology and drug discovery and systematically review the expression profile, domain architecture and chemical tractability of human E3 ligases that could expand the toolbox for PROTAC discovery. Small molecules that induce targeted protein degradation by the ubiquitinproteasome system, such as proteolysistargeting chimeras (PROTACs), are attracting great interest as a new therapeutic modality.

Quantum engines operating between a thermal and a squeezedthermal bath have been shown to surpass this bound. Yet, their maximum efficiency cannot be determined by the reversibility condition, which may yield an unachievable efficiency bound above unity. Here we identify the fraction of the exchanged energy between a quantum system and a bath that necessarily causes an entropy change and derive an inequality for this change. This inequality reveals an efficiency bound for quantum engines energised by a nonthermal bath. This bound does not imply reversibility, unless the two baths are thermal. It cannot be solely deduced from the laws of thermodynamics. Evaluating maximum conversion efficiency from heat to work using nonthermal baths can lead to meaningless results, when based only on the reversibility requirement.

Dystonia can be the manifesting neurological sign of many disorders, either in isolation (isolated dystonia) or with additional signs (combined dystonia). The main focus of this Primer is forms of isolated dystonia of idiopathic or genetic aetiology. These disorders differ in manifestations and severity but can affect all age groups and lead to substantial disability and impaired quality of life. The discovery of genes underlying the mendelian forms of isolated or combined dystonia has led to a better understanding of its pathophysiology. In some of the most common genetic dystonias, such as those caused by TOR1A, THAP1, GCH1 and KMT2B mutations, and idiopathic dystonia, these mechanisms include abnormalities in transcriptional regulation, striatal dopaminergic signalling and synaptic plasticity and a loss of inhibition at neuronal circuits. The diagnosis of dystonia is largely based on clinical signs, and the diagnosis and aetiological definition of this disorder remain a challenge. Effective symptomatic treatments with pharmacological therapy (anticholinergics), intramuscular botulinum toxin injection and deep brain stimulation are available; however, future research will hopefully lead to reliable biomarkers, better treatments and cure of this disorder.

Microbiome structures differed between the two cultivars. Transplantation of rhizosphere microbiota from resistant plants suppressed disease symptoms in susceptible plants. Comparative analyses of rhizosphere metagenomes from resistant and susceptible plants enabled the identification and assembly of a flavobacterial genome that was far more abundant in the resistant plant rhizosphere microbiome than in that of the susceptible plant.

Adsorption and spinodal decomposition are known precursor states to nucleation and phase transition; however, nucleation remains the less wellunderstood step in the complete thermodynamic sequence that shapes a microstructure. Here, we report nearatomicscale observations of a phase transition mechanism that consists in solute adsorption to crystalline defects followed by linear and planar spinodal fluctuations in an FeMn model alloy. These fluctuations provide a pathway for austenite nucleation due to the higher driving force for phase transition in the soluterich regions. Our observations are supported by thermodynamic calculations, which predict the possibility of spinodal decomposition due to magnetic ordering. Solidstate phase transitions often involve nucleation of the new phase on defects but a detailed mechanistic understanding has not been established.

While current influenza virus vaccines mostly induce an immune response against the immunodominant and variable head domain of the hemagglutinin, the major surface glycoprotein of the virus, the hemagglutinin stalk domain has been identified to harbor neutralizing Bcell epitopes that are conserved among and even between influenza A virus subtypes. A complete understanding of the differences in evolution between the main target of current vaccines and this more conserved stalk region are missing. Here, we performed an evolutionary analysis of the stalk domains of the hemagglutinin of prepandemic seasonal H1N1, pandemic H1N1, seasonal H3N2, and influenza B viruses and show quantitatively for the first time that the stalk domain is evolving at a rate that is significantly slower than that of the head domain. Additionally, we found that the crossreactive epitopes in the stalk domain targeted by broadly neutralizing monoclonal antibodies are evolving at an even slower rate compared to the full head and stalk regions of the protein. Finally, a fixedeffects likelihood selection analysis was performed for these virus groups in both the head and stalk domains. While several positive selection sites were found in the head domain, only a single site in the stalk domain of prepandemic seasonal H1 hemagglutinin was identified at amino acid position 468 (H1 numbering from methionine). This site is not located in or close to the epitopes of crossreactive antistalk monoclonal antibodies. Furthermore, we found that changes in this site do not significantly impact virus binding or neutralization by human antistalk antibodies, suggesting that some positive selection in the stalk domain is independent of immune pressures. We conclude that, while the stalk domain does evolve over time, this evolution is slow and, historically, is not directed to aid in evading neutralizing antibody responses.", "authors": "Ericka Kirkpatrick; Xueting Qiu; Patrick C.

Here we explore a secondary means of KRAS activation in cancer: focal highlevel amplification of the KRAS gene in the absence of coding mutations. These amplifications occur most commonly in esophageal, gastric and ovarian adenocarcinomas24. KRASamplified gastric cancer models show marked overexpression of the KRAS protein and are insensitive to MAPK blockade owing to their capacity to adaptively respond by rapidly increasing KRASGTP levels. Here we demonstrate that inhibition of the guanineexchange factors SOS1 and SOS2 or the protein tyrosine phosphatase SHP2 can attenuate this adaptive process and that targeting these factors, both genetically and pharmacologically, can enhance the sensitivity of KRASamplified models to MEK inhibition in both in vitro and in vivo settings. These data demonstrate the relevance of copynumber amplification as a mechanism of KRAS activation, and uncover the therapeutic potential for targeting of these tumors through combined SHP2 and MEK inhibition.

TEM imaging shows that these needles contain a high population of dislocations while TEMEDX analysis reveals high chemical homogeneity throughout the asfabricated samples as evidenced by the fact that there is even no micronanosegregation at interfaces between neighbouring  needles. The good chemical homogeneity is attributed to the extremely high cooling rate after SLM (106 Cs) and the formation of Si and Mnoxides that distribute randomly in the current samples. The laserprocessed samples show both superior strength and ductility as compared with conventionally manufactured counterparts. TEM examination on the deformed specimens reveals a significantly high density of dislocations and a great number of twinning within nanoneedles, suggesting that the plastic deformation has been governed by both gliding of dislocations and twinning deformation, which is believed to be responsible for the simultaneous acquisition of superior strength and ductility.

Here, we use a bidentate thiolateNHCgold(i) complex that is easily grafted onto commercial cetyl trimethylammonium bromidestabilized gold nanorods through ligand exchange. On mild reduction of the resulting surfacetethered NHCgold(i) complexes, the gold atom attached to the NHC complex is added to the surface as an adatom, thereby precluding the need for reorganization of the underlying surface lattice upon NHC binding.

Microtubule growth and shrinkage occur via addition and loss of tubulin subunits, which are biochemical processes. Dynamic microtubules can also engage in mechanical processes, such as exerting forces by pushing or pulling against a load. Recent advances at the intersection of biochemistry and mechanics have revealed the existence of multiple conformations of tubulin subunits and their central role in dictating the mechanisms of microtubule dynamics and force generation. It has become apparent that microtubuleassociated proteins (MAPs) selectively target specific tubulin conformations to regulate microtubule dynamics, and mechanical forces can also influence microtubule dynamics by altering the balance of tubulin conformations. Importantly, the conformational states of tubulin dimers are likely to be coupled throughout the lattice: the conformation of one dimer can influence the conformation of its nearest neighbours, and this effect can propagate over longer distances. This coupling provides a longrange mechanism by which MAPs and forces can modulate microtubule growth and shrinkage. These findings provide evidence that the interplay between biochemistry and mechanics is essential for the cellular functions of microtubules. Microtubules are highly dynamic tubulin polymers, and their dynamics are associated with a conformational cycle of individual tubulin subunits in the lattice. Recent evidence suggests that finetuning microtubule dynamics is enabled by the allosteric coupling of tubulin subunits, which propagates conformational changes through the lattice.", "authors": "Gary J.

Here we combine historical evidence\n                  4\n                 with nationallevel climate\n                  5\n                 and socioeconomic\n                  6\n                 projections to quantify the economic damages associated with the United Nations (UN) targets of 1.5 C and 2 C global warming, and those associated with current UN nationallevel mitigation commitments (which together approach 3 C warming\n                  7\n                ). We find that by the end of this century, there is a more than 75% chance that limiting warming to 1.5 C would reduce economic damages relative to 2 C, and a more than 60% chance that the accumulated global benefits will exceed US20 trillion under a 3% discount rate (2010 US dollars). We also estimate that 71% of countriesrepresenting 90% of the global populationhave a more than 75% chance of experiencing reduced economic damages at 1.5 C, with poorer countries benefiting most. Our results could understate the benefits of limiting warming to 1.5 C if unprecedented extreme outcomes, such as largescale sea level rise\n                  8\n                , occur for warming of 2 C but not for warming of 1.5 C. Inclusion of other unquantified sources of uncertainty, such as uncertainty in secular growth rates beyond that contained in existing socioeconomic scenarios, could also result in less precise impact estimates. We find considerably greater reductions in global economic output beyond 2 C. Relative to a world that did not warm beyond 20002010 levels, we project 15%25% reductions in per capita output by 2100 for the 2.53 C of global warming implied by current national commitments\n                  7\n                , and reductions of more than 30% for 4 C warming. Our results therefore suggest that achieving the 1.5 C target is likely to reduce aggregate damages and lessen global inequality, and that failing to meet the 2 C target is likely to increase economic damages substantially. If the world can meet the target of limiting global warming to 1.5 C, economic damage will probably be greatly reduced, especially in poorer countries.", "authors": "Marshall Burke; W.

MC4C distinguishes cooperative from random and competing interactions and identifies previously missed structures in subpopulations of cells. We show that individual elements of the globin superenhancer can aggregate into an enhancer hub that can simultaneously accommodate two genes. Neighboring chromatin domain loops can form rosettelike structures through collision of their CTCFbound anchors, as seen most prominently in cells lacking the cohesinunloading factor WAPL.

Moreover, inflammation may alter the crosstalk between the immune and the nervous systems, modulating the induction of synaptic plasticity and neurotransmission. In this Review, we examine the CNS structures and cognitive domains that are affected by the disease, with a specific focus on hippocampal involvement in MS and experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, an experimental model of MS.

Defects in duplication lead to aberrant numbers of centrioles and centrosomes. Recent insights into mechanisms of centriole biogenesis and centriole number control are helping us to better understand the links between aberrant centrosome number and human disease. Centrioles are conserved microtubulebased organelles that form the core of the centrosome and act as templates for the formation of cilia and flagella. Centrioles have important roles in most microtubulerelated processes, including motility, cell division and cell signalling. To coordinate these diverse cellular processes, centriole number must be tightly controlled. In cycling cells, one new centriole is formed next to each preexisting centriole in every cell cycle. Advances in imaging, proteomics, structural biology and genome editing have revealed new insights into centriole biogenesis, how centriole numbers are controlled and how alterations in these processes contribute to diseases such as cancer and neurodevelopmental disorders. Moreover, recent work has uncovered the existence of surveillance pathways that limit the proliferation of cells with numerical centriole aberrations. Owing to this progress, we now have a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms governing centriole biogenesis, opening up new possibilities for targeting these pathways in the context of human disease.", "authors": "Erich A.

Lifestyle factors, dietary habits and maternalneonatal interactions play a pivotal part in triggering the onset of food allergies, including qualitative and quantitative composition of the microbiota. These factors seem to have the greatest influence early in life, an observation that has led to the generation of hypotheses to explain the food allergy epidemic, including the dualallergen exposure hypothesis. These hypotheses have fuelled research in preventive strategies that seek to establish desensitization to allergens andor tolerance to allergens in affected individuals. Allergennonspecific therapeutic strategies have also been investigated in a number of clinical trials, which will eventually improve the treatment options for patients with food allergy.

Efforts toward this goal typically consider only canonical amino acids in the initial design process. However, incorporating unnatural amino acids that feature uniquely reactive side chains could significantly expand the catalytic repertoire of designer enzymes. To explore the potential of such artificial building blocks for enzyme design, here we selected paminophenylalanine as a potentially novel catalytic residue. We demonstrate that the catalytic activity of the aniline side chain for hydrazone and oxime formation reactions is increased by embedding paminophenylalanine into the hydrophobic pore of the multidrug transcriptional regulator from Lactococcus lactis. Both the recruitment of reactants by the promiscuous binding pocket and a judiciously placed aniline that functions as a catalytic residue contribute to the success of the identified artificial enzyme. We anticipate that our design strategy will prove rewarding to significantly expand the catalytic repertoire of designer enzymes in the future.

Here, we determined the structure of the minimal GTPase domain (MGD) of human MFN1 in complex with GDPBeF3. The MGD folds into a canonical GTPase fold with an associating fourhelix bundle, HB1, and forms a dimer. A potassium ion in the catalytic core engages GDP and BeF3 (GDPBeF3). Enzymatic analysis has confirmed that efficient GTP hydrolysis by MFN1 requires potassium. Compared to previously reported MGD structures, the HB1 structure undergoes a major conformational change relative to the GTPase domains, as they move from pointing in opposite directions to point in the same direction, suggesting that a swing of the fourhelix bundle can pull tethered membranes closer to achieve fusion. The proposed model is supported by results from in vitro biochemical assays and mitochondria morphology rescue assays in MFN1deleted cells. These findings offer an explanation for how CharcotMarieTooth neuropathy type 2 A (CMT2A)causing mutations compromise MFNmediated fusion.

We recently demonstrated that 133p53 promotes DNA doublestrand break (DSB) repair by upregulating transcription of the repair genes RAD51, LIG4 and RAD52 in a p53independent manner. However, 133p53 lacks the transactivation domain of fulllength p53, and the mechanism by which it exerts transcriptional activity independently of fulllength p53 remains unclear. In this report, we describe the accumulation of high levels of both 133p53 and p73 (a p53 family member) at 24 h post irradiation (hpi). 133p53 can form a complex with p73 upon irradiation. The coexpression of 133p53 and p73, but not either protein alone, can significantly promote DNA DSB repair mechanisms, including homologous recombination (HR), nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ) and singlestrand annealing (SSA). p73 and 133p53 act synergistically to promote the expression of RAD51, LIG4 and RAD52 by joining together to bind to region containing a 133p53responsive element (RE) and a p73RE in the promoters of all three repair genes. In addition to its accumulation at 24 hpi, p73 protein expression also peaks at 4 hpi. The depletion of p73 not only reduces earlystage apoptotic frequency (46 hpi), but also significantly increases laterstage DNA DSB accumulation (48 hpi), leading to cell cycle arrest in the G2 phase and, ultimately, cell senescence. In summary, the apoptotic regulator p73 also coordinates with 133p53 to promote DNA DSB repair, and the loss of function of p73 in DNA DSB repair may underlie spontaneous and carcinogeninduced tumorigenesis in p73 knockout mice.", "authors": "Hongjian Gong; Yuxi Zhang; Kunpeng Jiang; Shengfan Ye; Shuming Chen; Qinghe Zhang; Jinrong Peng; Jun Chen", "keywords": "Gene expression; Molecular biology", "organization_affiliated": "Innovation Center for Signaling Network, College of Life Sciences, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China; Innovation Center for Signaling Network, College of Life Sciences, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China; Innovation Center for Signaling Network, College of Life Sciences, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China; Innovation Center for Signaling Network, College of Life Sciences, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China; Innovation Center for Signaling Network, College of Life Sciences, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China; Innovation Center for Signaling Network, College of Life Sciences, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China; College of Animal Sciences,  Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China; Innovation Center for Signaling Network, College of Life Sciences, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China"}

Acrs have been found in many bacteriophages but so far not in archaeal viruses, despite the near ubiquity of CRISPRCas systems in archaea. Here, we report the functional and structural characterization of two archaeal Acrs from the lytic rudiviruses, SIRV2 and SIRV3. We show that a 4 kb deletion in the SIRV2 genome dramatically reduces infectivity in Sulfolobus islandicus LAL141 that carries functional CRISPRCas subtypes IA, ID and IIIB. Subsequent insertion of a single gene from SIRV3, gp02 (AcrID1), which is conserved in the deleted fragment, successfully restored infectivity. We demonstrate that AcrID1 protein inhibits the CRISPRCas subtype ID system by interacting directly with Cas10d protein, which is required for the interference stage. Sequence and structural analysis of AcrID1 show that it belongs to a conserved family of compact, dimeric sandwich proteins characterized by extreme pH and temperature stability and a tendency to form protein fibres. We identify about 50 homologues of AcrID1 in four archaeal viral families demonstrating the broad distribution of this group of antiCRISPR proteins. Like phages, archaeal viruses also encode antiCRISPR proteins (Acrs). These include AcrID1 from the lytic rudivirus SIRV3, which interacts with the Cas10d protein of Sulfolobus islandicus.

Despite the development of many animal and in vitro models for AD, there is a lack of an experimental approach that fully recapitulates essential aspects of the disease in human cells. Here, we report the generation of a new model to study AD, consisting of cerebral organoids (COs) produced from humaninduced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). Under our experimental conditions, COs grow to form threedimensional (3D) structures containing neural areas with corticallike organization. Analysis of COs by histological and biochemical methods revealed that organoids produced from iPSCs derived from patients affected by familial AD or Down syndrome (DS) spontaneously develop over time pathological features of AD, including accumulation of structures highly reminiscent to amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles. These pathological abnormalities were not observed in COs generated from various controls, including human iPSCs from healthy individuals, human iPSCs from patients affected by CreutzfeldtJakob disease, mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs), or mouse iPSCs.

Owing to a high mutation rate and low levels of recombination of mitrochondrial DNA (mtDNA), special selection mechanisms exist in the female germline to prevent the accumulation of deleterious mutations15. However, the molecular mechanisms that underpin selection are poorly understood6. Here we visualize germline selection in Drosophila using an allelespecific fluorescent in situhybridization approach to distinguish wildtype from mutant mtDNA. Selection first manifests in the early stages of Drosophila oogenesis, triggered by reduction of the profusion protein Mitofusin. This leads to the physical separation of mitochondrial genomes into different mitochondrial fragments, which prevents the mixing of genomes and their products and thereby reduces complementation. Once fragmented, mitochondria that contain mutant genomes are less able to produce ATP, which marks them for selection through a process that requires the mitophagy proteins Atg1 and BNIP3. A reduction in Atg1 or BNIP3 decreases the amount of wildtype mtDNA, which suggests a link between mitochondrial turnover and mtDNA replication. Fragmentation is not only necessary for selection in germline tissues, but is also sufficient to induce selection in somatic tissues in which selection is normally absent. We postulate that there is a generalizable mechanism for selection against deleterious mtDNA mutations, which may enable the development of strategies for the treatment of mtDNA disorders. An in situ hybridization approach is used to visualize mitochondrial DNA germline selection in Drosophila, revealing the role of mitochondrial fragmentation in the selection against deleterious mutations.", "authors": "Toby Lieber; Swathi P.

Moreover, our work suggests a viewpoint to understand and apply the samevalance dopants in heterogeneous catalysis, which is generally useful but still poorly understood. Electrocatalytic N2 conversion to ammonia offers a lowcarbon alternative to industrial ammonia production, although the rational design of active, efficient catalysts remains limited.

In practice, however, thermally activated transport phenomena are frequently observed also in solidstate molecular junctions but remain poorly understood. Here, we show experimentally the transition from the Marcus to the inverted Marcus region in a solidstate molecular tunnel junction by means of intramolecular orbital gating that can be tuned via the chemical structure of the molecule and applied bias. In the inverted Marcus region, charge transport is incoherent, yet virtually independent of temperature. Our experimental results fit well to a theoretical model that combines Landauer and Marcus theories and may have implications for the interpretation of temperaturedependent charge transport measurements in molecular junctions.

Metastasis remains the greatest challenge in the clinical management of cancer. Cell motility is a fundamental and ancient cellular behaviour that contributes to metastasis and is conserved in simple organisms. In this Review, we evaluate insights relevant to human cancer that are derived from the study of cell motility in nonmammalian model organisms. Dictyostelium discoideum, Caenorhabditis elegans, Drosophila melanogaster and Danio rerio permit direct observation of cells moving in complex native environments and lend themselves to largescale genetic and pharmacological screening. We highlight insights derived from each of these organisms, including the detailed signalling network that governs chemotaxis towards chemokines; a novel mechanism of basement membrane invasion; the positive role of Ecadherin in collective directionsensing; the identification and optimization of kinase inhibitors for metastatic thyroid cancer on the basis of work in flies; and the value of zebrafish for live imaging, especially of vascular remodelling and interactions between tumour cells and host tissues. While the motility of tumour cells and certain host cells promotes metastatic spread, the motility of tumourreactive T cells likely increases their antitumour effects. Therefore, it is important to elucidate the mechanisms underlying all types of cell motility, with the ultimate goal of identifying combination therapies that will increase the motility of beneficial cells and block the spread of harmful cells.", "authors": "Christina H.

The recent discovery of twodimensional (2D) van der Waals magnets11,12 has opened a new door for the electrical control of magnetism at the nanometre scale through a van der Waals heterostructure device platform13. Here we demonstrate the control of magnetism in bilayer CrI3, an antiferromagnetic (AFM) semiconductor in its ground state12, by the application of small gate voltages in fieldeffect devices and the detection of magnetization using magnetic circular dichroism (MCD) microscopy. The applied electric field creates an interlayer potential difference, which results in a large linear ME effect, whose sign depends on the interlayer AFM order. We also achieve a complete and reversible electrical switching between the interlayer AFM and FM states in the vicinity of the interlayer spinflip transition. The effect originates from the electricfield dependence of the interlayer exchange bias.

In contrast to brain metastases from solid tumours, metastases of ALL seldom involve the parenchyma but are isolated to the leptomeninges, which is an infrequent site for carcinomatous invasion. Although metastasis to the CNS occurs across all subtypes of ALL, a unifying mechanism for invasion has not yet been determined. Here we show that ALL cells in the circulation are unable to breach the bloodbrain barrier in mice; instead, they migrate into the CNS along vessels that pass directly between vertebral or calvarial bone marrow and the subarachnoid space. The basement membrane of these bridging vessels is enriched in laminin, which is known to coordinate pathfinding of neuronal progenitor cells in the CNS. The laminin receptor 6 integrin is expressed in most cases of ALL. We found that 6 integrinlaminin interactions mediated the migration of ALL cells towards the cerebrospinal fluid in vitro. Mice with ALL xenografts were treated with either a PI3K inhibitor, which decreased 6 integrin expression on ALL cells, or specific 6 integrinneutralizing antibodies and showed significant reductions in ALL transit along bridging vessels, blast counts in the cerebrospinal fluid and CNS disease symptoms despite minimally decreased bone marrow disease burden. Our data suggest that 6 integrin expression, which is common in ALL, allows cells to use neural migratory pathways to invade the CNS. Expression of 6 integrin enables acute lymphoblastic leukaemia cells to use neural migratory pathways to invade the central nervous system and metastasize to the brain.", "authors": "Hisayuki Yao; Trevor T.

The high single qubit fidelities possible in these systems, combined with quantum error correcting codes, could potentially offer a route to faulttolerant quantum computing. To achieve fault tolerance, however, gate error rates must be reduced to below a certain threshold and, in general, correlated errors must be removed. Here we show that pulse engineering techniques can be used to reduce the average Clifford gate error rates for silicon quantum dot spin qubits down to 0.043%. This represents a factor of three improvement over stateoftheart silicon quantum dot devices and extends the randomized benchmarking coherence time to 9.4 ms. By including tomographically complete measurements in our randomized benchmarking, we infer a higherorder feature of the noise called the unitarity, which measures the coherence of noise. This, in turn, allows us to theoretically predict that average gate error rates as low as 0.026% may be achievable with further pulse improvements. These spin qubit fidelities are ultimately limited by incoherent noise, which we attribute to charge noise from the silicon device structure or the environment.

Reaction prediction based on highlevel quantum chemical methods is complex3, even for simple molecules. Although machine learning is powerful for data analysis4,5, its applications in chemistry are still being developed6. Inspired by strategies based on chemists' intuition7, we propose that a reaction system controlled by a machine learning algorithm may be able to explore the space of chemical reactions quickly, especially if trained by an expert8. Here we present an organic synthesis robot that can perform chemical reactions and analysis faster than they can be performed manually, as well as predict the reactivity of possible reagent combinations after conducting a small number of experiments, thus effectively navigating chemical reaction space. By using machine learning for decision making, enabled by binary encoding of the chemical inputs, the reactions can be assessed in real time using nuclear magnetic resonance and infrared spectroscopy. The machine learning system was able to predict the reactivity of about 1,000 reaction combinations with accuracy greater than 80 per cent after considering the outcomes of slightly over 10 per cent of the dataset. This approach was also used to calculate the reactivity of published datasets. Further, by using realtime data from our robot, these predictions were followed up manually by a chemist, leading to the discovery of four reactions.

For the implementation of quantum algorithms and error detection810, qubit measurements are ideally performed in a single shot, which is presently achieved using onchip charge sensors, capacitively coupled to the quantum dots11. However, as the number of qubits is increased, this approach becomes impractical due to the footprint and complexity of the charge sensors, combined with the required proximity to the quantum dots12. Alternatively, the spin state can be measured directly by detecting the complex impedance of spindependent electron tunnelling between quantum dots1315. This can be achieved using radiofrequency reflectometry on a single gate electrode defining the quantum dot itself1519, significantly reducing the gate count and architectural complexity, but thus far it has not been possible to achieve singleshot spin readout using this technique. Here, we detect single electron tunnelling in a double quantum dot and demonstrate that gatebased sensing can be used to read out the electron spin state in a single shot, with an average readout fidelity of 73%. The result demonstrates a key step towards the readout of many spin qubits in parallel, using a compact gate design that will be needed for a largescale semiconductor quantum processor. Instead of using capacitively coupled charge sensors, which imply additional complexity in the device architecture, radiofrequency reflectometry on the gate defining the quantum dot can read out the spin state of a double quantum dot in a single shot.", "authors": "Anderson West; Bas Hensen; Alexis Jouan; Tuomo Tanttu; ChihHwan Yang; Alessandro Rossi; M.

To develop informationbased chemistry as a technology for programming matter to function in ways not seen in biological systems, it is necessary to understand how molecular interactions can encode and execute algorithms. The selfassembly of relatively simple units into complex products1 is particularly well suited for such investigations. Theory that combines mathematical tiling and statisticalmechanical models of molecular crystallization has shown that algorithmic behaviour can be embedded within molecular selfassembly processes2,3, and this has been experimentally demonstrated using DNA nanotechnology4 with up to 22 tile types511. However, many information technologies exhibit a complexity thresholdsuch as the minimum transistor count needed for a generalpurpose computerbeyond which the power of a reprogrammable system increases qualitatively, and it has been unclear whether the biophysics of DNA selfassembly allows that threshold to be exceeded. Here we report the design and experimental validation of a DNA tile set that contains 355 singlestranded tiles and can, through simple tile selection, be reprogrammed to implement a wide variety of 6bit algorithms. We use this set to construct 21 circuits that execute algorithms including copying, sorting, recognizing palindromes and multiples of 3, random walking, obtaining an unbiased choice from a biased random source, electing a leader, simulating cellular automata, generating deterministic and randomized patterns, and counting to 63, with an overall pertile error rate of less than 1 in 3,000. These findings suggest that molecular selfassembly could be a reliable algorithmic component within programmable chemical systems. The development of molecular machines that are reprogrammableat a high level of abstraction and thus without requiring knowledge of the underlying physicswill establish a creative space in which molecular programmers can flourish. A set of 355 selfassembling DNA 'tiles' can be reprogrammed to implement many different computer algorithmsincluding sorting, palindrome testing and divisibility by threesuggesting that molecular selfassembly could be a reliable algorithmic component in programmable chemical systems.", "authors": "Damien Woods; David Doty; Cameron Myhrvold; Joy Hui; Felix Zhou; Peng Yin; Erik Winfree", "keywords": "Computer science; DNA computing", "organization_affiliated": "California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, USA; Inria, Paris, France; Maynooth University, Maynooth, Ireland; California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, USA; University of California, Davis, USA; Wyss Institute for Biologically Inspired Engineering, Harvard University, Boston, USA; Department of Systems Biology, Harvard University, Boston, USA; California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, USA; Harvard University, Cambridge, USA; California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, USA; University of Oxford, Oxford, UK; Wyss Institute for Biologically Inspired Engineering, Harvard University, Boston, USA; Department of Systems Biology, Harvard University, Boston, USA; California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, USA"}

The majority of ALS patients have no familial history, making the modeling of sporadic ALS (SALS) essential to the development of ALS therapeutics. However, as mutations underlying ALS pathogenesis have not yet been identified, it remains difficult to establish useful models of SALS. Using induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) technology to generate stem and differentiated cells retaining the patients' full genetic information, we have established a large number of in vitro cellular models of SALS. These models showed phenotypic differences in their pattern of neuronal degeneration, types of abnormal protein aggregates, cell death mechanisms, and onset and progression of these phenotypes in vitro among cases. We therefore developed a system for case clustering capable of subdividing these heterogeneous SALS models by their in vitro characteristics. We further evaluated multiplephenotype rescue of these subclassified SALS models using agents selected from nonSOD1 FALS models, and identified ropinirole as a potential therapeutic candidate. Integration of the datasets acquired in this study permitted the visualization of molecular pathologies shared across a wide range of SALS models. iPSCderived motor neurons from over 30 heterogeneous sporadic ALS cases exhibit pathologies correlated with clinical disease progression, are more similar to FUSTDP43 familial ALS than SOD1ALS and are corrected by repurposing of ropinirole.", "authors": "Koki Fujimori; Mitsuru Ishikawa; Asako Otomo; Naoki Atsuta; Ryoichi Nakamura; Tetsuya Akiyama; Shinji Hadano; Masashi Aoki; Hideyuki Saya; Gen Sobue; Hideyuki Okano", "keywords": "Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis; Highthroughput screening; Mechanisms of disease; Stemcell biotechnology", "organization_affiliated": "Department of Physiology, Keio University School of Medicine, Shinjukuku, Tokyo, Japan; Department of Physiology, Keio University School of Medicine, Shinjukuku, Tokyo, Japan; The Institute of Medical Sciences, Tokai University, Isehara, Japan; Department of Molecular Life Sciences, Tokai University School of Medicine, Isehara, Japan; MicroNano Technology Center, Tokai University, Hiratsuka, Japan; Department of Neurology, Nagoya University Graduate School of Medicine, Nagoya, Japan; Department of Neurology, Nagoya University Graduate School of Medicine, Nagoya, Japan; Department of Neurology, Tohoku University Graduate School of Medicine, Sendai, Japan; The Institute of Medical Sciences, Tokai University, Isehara, Japan; Department of Molecular Life Sciences, Tokai University School of Medicine, Isehara, Japan; Research Center for Brain and Nervous Diseases, Tokai University Graduate School of Medicine, Isehara, Japan; Department of Neurology, Tohoku University Graduate School of Medicine, Sendai, Japan; Division of Gene Regulation, Institute for Advanced Medical Research, Keio University School of Medicine, Shinjukuku, Tokyo, Japan; Department of Neurology, Nagoya University Graduate School of Medicine, Nagoya, Japan; Research Division of Dementia and Neurodegenerative Disease, Nagoya University Graduate School of Medicine, Nagoya, Japan; Department of Physiology, Keio University School of Medicine, Shinjukuku, Tokyo, Japan"}

Here we demonstrate that the synergistic combination of copper catalysis and photoredox catalysis can provide a general platform from which to address this challenge. This crosscoupling system uses naturally abundant alkyl carboxylic acids and commercially available nitrogen nucleophiles as coupling partners. It is applicable to a wide variety of primary, secondary and tertiary alkyl carboxylic acids (through iodonium activation), as well as a vast array of nitrogen nucleophiles: nitrogen heterocycles, amides, sulfonamides and anilines can undergo CN coupling to provide Nalkyl products in good to excellent efficiency, at room temperature and on short timescales (five minutes to one hour). We demonstrate that this CN coupling protocol proceeds with high regioselectivity using substrates that contain several amine groups, and can also be applied to complex drug molecules, enabling the rapid construction of molecular complexity and the latestage functionalization of bioactive pharmaceuticals.

However, hardertoreach fossil fuels require more energy to extract and, hence, are coming at an increasing 'energy cost'. Associated declines in fossil fuel energyreturnoninvestment ratios at first appear of little concern, given that published estimates for oil, coal and gas are typically above 25:1. However, such ratios are measured at the primary energy stage and should instead be estimated at the final stage where energy enters the economy (for example, electricity and petrol). Here, we calculate global time series (19952011) energyreturnoninvestment ratios for fossil fuels at both primary and final energy stages. We concur with common primarystage estimates (~30:1), but find very low ratios at the final stage: around 6:1 and declining. This implies that fossil fuel energyreturnoninvestment ratios may be much closer to those of renewables than previously expected and that they could decline precipitously in the near future. Published energyreturnoninvestment ratios for fossil fuels have not always been estimated at the final point of use.

By applying knowledge of the cellular taxonomy of the brain from singlecell RNA sequencing, we evaluated whether the genomic loci implicated in schizophrenia map onto specific brain cell types. We found that the commonvariant genomic results consistently mapped to pyramidal cells, medium spiny neurons (MSNs) and certain interneurons, but far less consistently to embryonic, progenitor or glial cells. These enrichments were due to sets of genes that were specifically expressed in each of these cell types. We also found that many of the diverse gene sets previously associated with schizophrenia (genes involved in synaptic function, those encoding mRNAs that interact with FMRP, antipsychotic targets, etc.) generally implicated the same brain cell types. Our results suggest a parsimonious explanation: the commonvariant genetic results for schizophrenia point at a limited set of neurons, and the gene sets point to the same cells. The genetic risk associated with MSNs did not overlap with that of glutamatergic pyramidal cells and interneurons, suggesting that different cell types have biologically distinct roles in schizophrenia.

By probing human serum for the presence of antiCas9 antibodies using an enzymelinked immunosorbent assay, we detected antibodies against both SaCas9 and SpCas9 in 78% and 58% of donors, respectively. We also found antiSaCas9 T cells in 78% and antiSpCas9 T cells in 67% of donors, which demonstrates a high prevalence of antigenspecific T cells against both orthologs. We confirmed that these T cells were Cas9specific by demonstrating a Cas9specific cytokine response following isolation, expansion, and antigen restimulation. Together, these data demonstrate that there are preexisting humoral and cellmediated adaptive immune responses to Cas9 in humans, a finding that should be taken into account as the CRISPRCas9 system moves toward clinical trials. Cas9specific antibodies and reactive T cells are found in the majority of healthy adult human serum samples analyzed. Such preexisting adaptive immunity should be taken into consideration as the CRISPRCas9 system moves toward clinical trials.", "authors": "Carsten T. Charlesworth; Priyanka S. Deshpande; Daniel P.

Most early efforts in battery safety modelling focused on either one battery cell or a single field of interest such as mechanical or thermal failure. These efforts may not completely reflect the failure of batteries in automotive applications, where various physical processes can take place in a large number of cells simultaneously. In this Perspective, we review modelling and testing approaches for battery safety under abuse conditions. We then propose a general framework for largescale multiphysics modelling and experimental work to address safety issues of automotive batteries in realworld applications. In particular, we consider modelling coupled mechanical, electrical, electrochemical and thermal behaviours of batteries, and explore strategies to extend simulations to the battery module and pack level. Moreover, we evaluate safety test approaches for an entire range of automotive hardware sets from cell to pack. We also discuss challenges in building this framework and directions for its future development. Battery safety is a key focus in the design of electrified vehicles.

MDD subjects showed significant improvements in depressive symptoms, and healthy control subjects exhibited modest but significant increases in depressive symptoms for up to 1 day after ketamine administration. Both groups showed increased resting gamma power following ketamine. In MDD subjects, gamma power was not associated with the magnitude of the antidepressant effect. However, baseline gamma power was found to moderate the relationship between postketamine gamma power and antidepressant response; specifically, higher postketamine gamma power was associated with better response in MDD subjects with lower baseline gamma, with an inverted relationship in MDD subjects with higher baseline gamma. This relationship was observed in multiple regions involved in networks hypothesized to be involved in the pathophysiology of MDD.

Yet continued expansion of fossilfuelburning energy infrastructure implies already 'committed' future CO2 emissions613. Here we use detailed datasets of existing fossilfuel energy infrastructure in 2018 to estimate regional and sectoral patterns of committed CO2 emissions, the sensitivity of such emissions to assumed operating lifetimes and schedules, and the economic value of the associated infrastructure. We estimate that, if operated as historically, existing infrastructure will cumulatively emit about 658 gigatonnes of CO2 (with a range of 226 to 1,479 gigatonnes CO2, depending on the lifetimes and utilization rates assumed). More than half of these emissions are predicted to come from the electricity sector; infrastructure in China, the USA and the 28 member states of the European Union represents approximately 41 per cent, 9 per cent and 7 per cent of the total, respectively. If built, proposed power plants (planned, permitted or under construction) would emit roughly an extra 188 (range 37427) gigatonnes CO2. Committed emissions from existing and proposed energy infrastructure (about 846 gigatonnes CO2) thus represent more than the entire carbon budget that remains if mean warming is to be limited to 1.5 degrees Celsius (C) with a probability of 66 to 50 per cent (420580 gigatonnes CO2)5, and perhaps twothirds of the remaining carbon budget if mean warming is to be limited to less than 2 C (1,1701,500 gigatonnes CO2)5. The remaining carbon budget estimates are varied and nuanced14,15, and depend on the climate target and the availability of largescale negative emissions16. Nevertheless, our estimates suggest that little or no new CO2emitting infrastructure can be commissioned, and that existing infrastructure may need to be retired early (or be retrofitted with carbon capture and storage technology) in order to meet the Paris Agreement climate goals17. Given the asset value per tonne of committed emissions, we suggest that the most costeffective premature infrastructure retirements will be in the electricity and industry sectors, if nonemitting alternatives are available and affordable4,18.

The prelimbic (PL) cortex, a subregion of prefrontal cortex, plays a critical role in fear memory retrieval over time. Most studies have focused on acquisition, consolidation, and retrieval of recent memories, but much less is known about the neural mechanisms of remote memory. Using a new knockin mouse for activitydependent genetic labeling (TRAP2), we demonstrate that neuronal ensembles in the PL cortex are dynamic. PL neurons TRAPed during later memory retrievals are more likely to be reactivated and make larger behavioral contributions to remote memory retrieval compared to those TRAPed during learning or early memory retrieval. PL activity during learning is required to initiate this timedependent reorganization in PL ensembles underlying memory retrieval. Finally, while neurons TRAPed during earlier and later retrievals have similar broad projections throughout the brain, PL neurons TRAPed later have a stronger functional recruitment of cortical targets. DeNardo et al. characterize TRAP2, which allows genetic access to neurons based on their activity, and use it to show that neuronal ensembles in prelimbic cortex for remote fear memory undergo dynamic changes during the first 14 days after learning.", "authors": "Laura A.

Mutant IDH1 produces high levels of 2hydroxyglurate (2HG), thought to initiate oncogenesis through epigenetic modifications of gene expression. In this study, we show the initial evidence of the pharmacodynamics of a new mutant IDH1 inhibitor in glioma patients, using noninvasive 3D MR spectroscopic imaging of 2HG. Our results from a Phase 1 clinical trial indicate a rapid decrease of 2HG levels by 70% (CI 13%, P  0.019) after 1 week of treatment. Importantly, inhibition of mutant IDH1 may lead to the reprogramming of tumor metabolism, suggested by simultaneous changes in glutathione, glutamine, glutamate, and lactate. An inverse correlation between metabolic changes and diffusion MRI indicates an effect on the tumorcell density.

Singlecell deep mtDNA sequencing of in vivo human female PGCs showed rare variants reaching higher heteroplasmy levels in late PGCs, consistent with the observed genetic bottleneck. We also saw the signature of selection against nonsynonymous proteincoding, tRNA gene and Dloop variants, concomitant with a progressive upregulation of genes involving mtDNA replication and transcription, and linked to a transition from glycolytic to oxidative metabolism. The associated metabolic shift would expose deleterious mutations to selection during early germ cell development, preventing the relentless accumulation of mtDNA mutations in the human population predicted by Muller's ratchet.

We report a largescale investigation of 372 human faecal metatranscriptomes and 929 metagenomes from a subset of 308 men in the Health Professionals FollowUp Study. We identified a metatranscriptomic 'core' universally transcribed over time and across participants, often by different microorganisms. In contrast to the housekeeping functions enriched in this core, a 'variable' metatranscriptome included specialized pathways that were differentially expressed both across participants and among microorganisms. Finally, longitudinal metagenomic profiles allowed ecological interaction network reconstruction, which remained stable over the sixmonth timespan, as did strain tracking within and between participants. These results provide an initial characterization of human faecal microbial ecology into core, subjectspecific, microorganismspecific and temporally variable transcription, and they differentiate metagenomically versus metatranscriptomically informative aspects of the human faecal microbiome. Analysis of human faecal metatranscriptomes and metagenomes reveals core and variable metatranscriptomes across time and individuals, and similar strainlevel variation within and between subjects, providing further insights into human microbial ecology.", "authors": "Galeb S.

Here we show how the abundance of Leguminosae is affected by both recovery from disturbance and largescale rainfall gradients through a synthesis of forest inventory plots from a network of 42 Neotropical forest chronosequences. During the first three decades of natural forest regeneration, legume basal area is twice as high in dry compared with wet secondary forests. The tremendous ecological success of legumes in recently disturbed, waterlimited forests is likely to be related to both their reduced leaflet size and ability to fix N2, which together enhance legume drought tolerance and wateruse efficiency. Earth system models should incorporate these largescale successional and climatic patterns of legume dominance to provide more accurate estimates of the maximum potential for natural nitrogen fixation across tropical forests. Data from 42 chronosequence sites show a geater abundance of legumes in seasonally dry forests than in wet forests, particularly during early secondary succession, probably owing to legumes' nitrogenfixing ability and reduced leaflet size.", "authors": "Maga Gei; Danae M.

Previously, we and others have shown that core sequences at the BCL11A erythroid enhancer are required for repression of HbF in adultstage erythroid cells but are dispensable in nonerythroid cells26. CRISPRCas9mediated gene modification has demonstrated variable efficiency, specificity, and persistence in hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). Here, we demonstrate that Cas9:sgRNA ribonucleoprotein (RNP)mediated cleavage within a GATA1 binding site at the 58 BCL11A erythroid enhancer results in highly penetrant disruption of this motif, reduction of BCL11A expression, and induction of fetal globin. We optimize conditions for selectionfree ontarget editing in patientderived HSCs as a nearly complete reaction lacking detectable genotoxicity or deleterious impact on stem cell function. HSCs preferentially undergo nonhomologous compared with microhomologymediated end joining repair. Erythroid progeny of edited engrafting SCD HSCs express therapeutic levels of HbF and resist sickling, while those from patients with thalassemia show restored globin chain balance. Nonhomologous end joining repairbased BCL11A enhancer editing approaching complete allelic disruption in HSCs is a practicable therapeutic strategy to produce durable HbF induction. Optimized conditions for ribonucleoprotein delivery of Cas9sgRNA complexes enables precise and efficient gene editing to restore fetal hemoglobin expression in sickle cell disease patientderived HSCs", "authors": "Yuxuan Wu; Jing Zeng; Benjamin P.

Recently, optomechanical microsystems in which light and vibrational modes are coupled through ponderomotive forces have demonstrated strong nonreciprocal effects through a variety of techniques, but always using optical pumping. None of these approaches has demonstrated bandwidth exceeding that of the mechanical system, and all of them require optical power; these are both fundamental and practical issues. Here, we resolve both challenges by breaking timereversal symmetry using a twodimensional acoustic pump that simultaneously provides a nonzero overlap integral for lightsound interaction and also satisfies the necessary phasematching. We use this technique to produce a nonreciprocal modulator (a frequency shifting isolator) by means of indirect interband scattering. We demonstrate mode conversion asymmetry up to 15 dB and efficiency as high as 17% over a bandwidth exceeding 1 GHz. Timereversal symmetry is broken via an acoustic pumping scheme enabling demonstration of a frequency shifting optical isolator with 15 dB asymmetry and 1 GHz bandwidth.", "authors": "Donggyu B.

Over the decadeslong course of the disease, patients develop large fluidfilled renal cysts that impair kidney function, leading to endstage renal disease in ~50% of patients. Despite the identification of numerous dysregulated pathways in ADPKD, the molecular mechanisms underlying the renal dysfunction from mutations in PKD genes and the physiological functions of the polycystin proteins are still unclear. Alterations in cell metabolism have emerged in the past decade as a hallmark of ADPKD. ADPKD cells shift their mode of energy production from oxidative phosphorylation to alternative pathways, such as glycolysis. In addition, the polycystins seem to play regulatory roles in modulating mechanisms and machinery related to energy production and utilization, including AMPK, PPAR, PGC1, calcium signalling at mitochondriaassociated membranes, mTORC1, cAMP and CFTRmediated ion transport as well as the expression of crucial components of the mitochondrial energy production apparatus. In this Review, we explore these metabolic changes and discuss in detail the relationship between energy metabolism and ADPKD pathogenesis and identify potential therapeutic targets.

Alternative approaches for solidstate heattoelectricity conversion include thermophotovoltaic (TPV) systems where photons from a hot emitter traverse a vacuum gap and are absorbed by a photovoltaic (PV) cell to generate electrical power. In principle, such systems may also achieve higher efficiencies and offer more versatility in use. However, the typical temperature of the hot emitter remains too low (1,000 K) to achieve a sufficient photon flux to the PV cell, limiting practical applications. Theoretical proposals312 suggest that nearfield (NF) effects1318 that arise in nanoscale gaps may be leveraged to increase the photon flux to the PV cell and significantly enhance the power output. Here, we describe functional NFTPV devices consisting of a microfabricated system and a custombuilt nanopositioner and demonstrate an ~40fold enhancement in the power output at nominally 60 nm gaps relative to the far field. We systematically characterize this enhancement over a range of gap sizes and emitter temperatures, and for PV cells with two different bandgap energies. We anticipate that this technology, once optimized, will be viable for waste heat recovery applications.

Although circulating A(H3N2) viruses did not differ antigenically from that recommended by the WHO for vaccine production, overall interim vaccine effectiveness estimates were below historic averages (33%) for A(H3N2) viruses. The majority (US) or all (Australian) vaccine doses contained multiple aminoacid changes in the hemagglutinin protein, resulting from the necessary adaptation of the virus to embryonated hen's eggs used for most vaccine manufacturing. Previous reports have suggested a potential negative impact of eggdriven substitutions on vaccine performance. With BARDA support, two vaccines licensed in the US are produced in cell culture: recombinant influenza vaccine (RIV, Flublok) manufactured in insect cells and inactivated mammalian cellgrown vaccine (ccIIV, Flucelvax). Quadrivalent ccIIV (ccIIV4) vaccine for the 20172018 influenza season was produced using an A(H3N2) seed virus propagated exclusively in cell culture and therefore lacking egg adaptative changes. Sufficient ccIIV doses were distributed (but not RIV doses) to enable preliminary estimates of its higher effectiveness relative to the traditional eggbased vaccines, with study details pending.

However, the gaseous state of CO2 does render the indefinite storage of this greenhouse gas challenging. Herein, we created a liquid metal electrocatalyst that contains metallic elemental cerium nanoparticles, which facilitates the electrochemical reduction of CO2 to layered solid carbonaceous species, at a low onset potential of 310 mV vs CO2C. We exploited the formation of a cerium oxide catalyst at the liquid metalelectrolyte interface, which together with cerium nanoparticles, promoted the room temperature reduction of CO2. Due to the inhibition of van der Waals adhesion at the liquid interface, the electrode was remarkably resistant to deactivation via coking caused by solid carbonaceous species. The asproduced solid carbonaceous materials could be utilised for the fabrication of highperformance capacitor electrodes. Overall, this liquid metal enabled electrocatalytic process at room temperature may result in a viable negative emission technology.

Here, we use a binary pn junction strategy to prepare a series of photocathodes that convert sunlight into highenergy electrons for efficient CO2 reduction to formate. The photocathodes integrate a semiconductor pn junction comprising GaN nanowire arrays on silicon, with molecular pn junctions selfassembled on the semiconductor surface. Solar irradiation of the photocathodes generates redoxseparated states that interact to form an intermediate state with remotely separated electrons and holes at the catalyst and semiconductor, respectively.

From a cohort of 2000 pregnant women, we performed a nested case control study on 107 wellphenotyped cases of spontaneous preterm birth (sPTB) and 432 women delivering at term. Using innovative Bayesian modeling of cervicovaginal microbiota, seven bacterial taxa were significantly associated with increased risk of sPTB, with a stronger effect in African American women. However, higher vaginal levels of defensin2 lowered the risk of sPTB associated with cervicovaginal microbiota in an ethnicitydependent manner. Surprisingly, even in Lactobacillus spp. dominated cervicovaginal microbiota, low defensin2 was associated with increased risk of sPTB. These findings hold promise for diagnostics to accurately identify women at risk for sPTB early in pregnancy.

The glomerular endothelium, which is highly fenestrated and covered by a rich glycocalyx, participates in the sieving properties of the glomerular filtration barrier and in the maintenance of podocyte structure. The microvascular endothelium in peritubular capillaries, which is also fenestrated, transports reabsorbed components and participates in epithelial cell function. The endothelium of large and small vessels supports the renal vasculature. These renal endothelia are protected by regulators of thrombosis, inflammation and complement, but endothelial injury (for example, induced by toxins, antibodies, immune cells or inflammatory cytokines) or defects in factors that provide endothelial protection (for example, regulators of complement or angiogenesis) can lead to acute or chronic renal injury. Moreover, renal endothelial cells can transition towards a mesenchymal phenotype, favouring renal fibrosis and the development of chronic kidney disease. Thus, the renal endothelium is both a target and a driver of kidney and systemic cardiovascular complications. Emerging therapeutic strategies that target the renal endothelium may lead to improved outcomes for both rare and common renal diseases. The kidney is a highly vascularized organ and contains a remarkable diversity of endothelial cell populations.

Diet influences the composition of the gut microbiota. The ketogenic diet (KD) is a highfat, adequateprotein, lowcarbohydrate diet established for treatment of therapyresistant epilepsy in children. Its efficacy in reducing seizures has been confirmed, but the mechanisms remain elusive. The diet has also shown positive effects in a wide range of other diseases, including Alzheimer's, depression, autism, cancer, and type 2 diabetes. We collected fecal samples from 12 children with therapyresistant epilepsy before starting KD and after 3 months on the diet. Parents did not start KD and served as diet controls. Applying shotgun metagenomic DNA sequencing, both taxonomic and functional profiles were established. Here we report that alpha diversity is not changed significantly during the diet, but differences in both taxonomic and functional composition are detected. Relative abundance of bifidobacteria as well as E. rectale and Dialister is significantly diminished during the intervention. An increase in relative abundance of E. coli is observed on KD. Functional analysis revealed changes in 29 SEED subsystems including the reduction of seven pathways involved in carbohydrate metabolism. Decomposition of these shifts indicates that bifidobacteria and Escherichia are important contributors to the observed functional shifts. As relative abundance of healthpromoting, fiberconsuming bacteria becomes less abundant during KD, we raise concern about the effects of the diet on the gut microbiota and overall health. Further studies need to investigate whether these changes are necessary for the therapeutic effect of KD. The ketogenic diet changes both the relative abundance of gut microbiota and their metabolic activities. The diet forces a shift from carbohydrates to ketones as a primary energy source and has demonstrated efficacy in reducing epileptic seizures in children. After animal models implicated gut microbiota in this amelioration, Stefanie PrastNielsen, of Sweden's Karolinska Institutet, and her team sequenced microbiotic DNA of fecal samples from 12 children with epilepsy before and after 3 months on a ketogenic diet. Changes included reductions in the numbers of Bifidobacterium and an increase in Escherichia coli. Carbohydrate metabolism significantly changed after 3 months on the diet. Some reductions raise questions about the diet's potential impact on gut and overall health.

In particular, the number of radiation defects produced in energetic cascades in metals is only ~13 the NRTdpa prediction, while the number of atoms involved in atomic mixing is about a factor of 30 larger than the dpa value. Here we propose two new complementary displacement production estimators (athermal recombination corrected dpa, arcdpa) and atomic mixing (replacements per atom, rpa) functions that extend the NRTdpa by providing more physically realistic descriptions of primary defect creation in materials and may become additional standard measures for radiation damage quantification.

Multiple chemistryclimatemodel simulations indicate that the positive EurasiaNorth America dipole trend in late winter is likely to continue in the near future. Our findings suggest that the anticipated ozone recovery in late winter will be sensitive not only to the ozonedepleting substance decline but also to the polar vortex changes, and could be substantially delayed in some regions of the Northern Hemisphere extratropics.

Daytoday water stagnation in building plumbing can potentially result in water quality deterioration (e.g., lead release or pathogen proliferation), which is a major public health concern. However, little is known about the microbial ecosystem processes in plumbing systems, hindering the development of biological monitoring strategies. Here, we track tap water microbiome assembly in situ, showing that bacterial community composition changes rapidly from the city supply following ~6day stagnation, along with an increase in cell count from 103 cellsmL to upwards of 7.8  105 cellsmL. Remarkably, bacterial community assembly was highly reproducible in this built environment system (median Spearman correlation between temporal replicates  0.78). Using an island biogeography model, we show that neutral processes arising from the microbial communities in the city water supply (i.e., migration and demographic stochasticity) explained the island community composition in proximal pipes (Goodnessoffit  0.48), yet declined as water approached the faucet (Goodnessoffit  0.21). We developed a sizeeffect model to simulate this process, which indicated that pipe diameter drove these changes by mediating the kinetics of hypochlorite decay and cell detachment, affecting selection, migration, and demographic stochasticity. Our study challenges current water quality monitoring practice worldwide which ignore biological growth in plumbing, and suggests the island biogeography model as a useful framework to evaluate building water system quality.", "authors": "Fangqiong Ling; Rachel Whitaker; Mark W.

Chemical tuning of spacer organic cations has attracted great interest due to their additional functionalities. However, how the chemical nature of the organic cations affects the properties of twodimensional perovskites and devices is rarely reported. Here we demonstrate that the selection of spacer cations (i.e., selective fluorination of phenethylammonium) affects the film properties of twodimensional perovskites, leading to different device performance of twodimensional perovskite solar cells (average n  4). Structural analysis reveals that different packing arrangements and orientational disorder of the spacer cations result in orientational degeneracy and different formation energies, largely explaining the difference in film properties. This work provides key missing information on how spacer cations exert influence on desirable electronic properties and device performance of twodimensional perovskites via the weak and cooperative interactions of these cations in the crystal lattice. Two dimensional halide perovskites solar cells have attracted research interest due to their higher stability compared to three dimensional counterparts.

In this work, simple nonfusedring electron acceptors are developed through twostep synthesis from single aromatic units for constructing efficient OSCs. With the assistance of noncovalent interactions, these rotatable nonfused acceptors (in solution) allow transiting into planar and stackable conformation in condensed solid, promoting acceptors not only feasible solutionprocessability, but also excellent film characteristics. As results, decent power conversion efficiencies of 10.27% and 13.97% can be achieved in single and tandem OSCs consisting of simple solutioncast blends, in which the fully unfused acceptors exhibit exceptionally low synthetic complexity index. In addition, the unfused acceptor and its based OSCs exhibit promising stabilities under continuous illumination. Overall, this work reveals valuable insights on the structural design of simple and effective electron acceptors with great practical perspectives. Nonfullerene electron acceptors have pushed the efficiency of organic solar cells up to 15% but they all contain fused rings and are inconvenient to synthetic access.

However, the regulatory functions and underlying molecular mechanisms of GAS5 in BC development remain unclear. Here, we confirmed that there was a negative correlation between GAS5 level and bladder tumor clinical stage. Functionally, overexpression of GAS5 reduced cell viability and induced cell apoptosis in T24 and EJ bladder cancer cells. Mechanistically, GAS5 effectively repressed EZH2 transcription by directly interacting with E2F4 and recruiting E2F4 to EZH2 promoter. We previously reported that miR101 induced the apoptosis of BC cells by inhibiting the expression of EZH2. Interestingly, the present study showed that downregulation of EZH2 by GAS5 resulted in overexpression of miR101 in T24 and EJ cells. Furthermore, the level of GAS5 was increased under the treatment of Gambogic acid (GA), a promising natural anticancer compound, whereas knockdown of GAS5 suppressed the inhibitory effect of GA on cell viability and abolished GAinduced apoptosis in T24 and EJ cells. Taken together, our findings demonstrated a tumorsuppressor role of GAS5 by inhibiting EZH2 on transcriptional level, and additionally provided a novel therapeutic strategy for treating human bladder cancer.", "authors": "Miao Wang; Chen Guo; Liang Wang; Gang Luo; Chao Huang; Yawei Li; Dong Liu; Fuqing Zeng; Guosong Jiang; Xingyuan Xiao", "keywords": "Life Sciences, general; Biochemistry, general; Cell Biology; Immunology; Cell Culture; Antibodies", "organization_affiliated": "Department of Urology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China; Department of Urology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China; Department of Urology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China; Department of Urology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China; Department of Urology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China; Department of Urology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China; Department of Urology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China; Department of Urology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China; Department of Urology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China; Department of Urology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"}

We find that the MitoCATg particles specifically target mitochondria and deplete mitochondrial glutathione with atomic economy, thus amplifying the reactive oxygen species damage caused by cinnamaldehyde and finally leading to apoptosis in cancer cells. We show that imagingguided interventional injection of these particles potently inhibits tumour growth in subcutaneous and orthotopic patientderived xenograft hepatocellular carcinoma models without adverse effects.

Exercise has many beneficial effects on brain health, contributing to decreased risks of dementia, depression and stress, and it has a role in restoring and maintaining cognitive function and metabolic control. The fact that exercise is sensed by the brain suggests that muscleinduced peripheral factors enable direct crosstalk between muscle and brain function. Muscle secretes myokines that contribute to the regulation of hippocampal function. Evidence is accumulating that the myokine cathepsin B passes through the bloodbrain barrier to enhance brainderived neurotrophic factor production and hence neurogenesis, memory and learning. Exercise increases neuronal gene expression of FNDC5 (which encodes the PGC1dependent myokine FNDC5), which can likewise contribute to increased brainderived neurotrophic factor levels. Serum levels of the prototype myokine, IL6, increase with exercise and might contribute to the suppression of central mechanisms of feeding. Exercise also increases the PGC1dependent muscular expression of kynurenine aminotransferase enzymes, which induces a beneficial shift in the balance between the neurotoxic kynurenine and the neuroprotective kynurenic acid, thereby reducing depressionlike symptoms. Myokine signalling, other muscular factors and exerciseinduced hepatokines and adipokines are implicated in mediating the exerciseinduced beneficial impact on neurogenesis, cognitive function, appetite and metabolism, thus supporting the existence of a musclebrain endocrine loop. Exercise has many beneficial effects on brain health, but how exercise is sensed by the brain has not been well understood. This Review describes evidence that supports the existence of a musclebrain endocrine loop, in which muscleinduced peripheral factors enable direct crosstalk between muscle and brain. \n                \n                  \n                    \n                  \n                  \n                    \n                  \n                  \n                    \n                  \n                  \n                    \n                  \n                  \n                    \n                  \n                  \n                    \n                  \n                \n              ", "authors": "Bente Klarlund Pedersen", "keywords": "Hormones; Molecular medicine; Obesity; Type 2 diabetes", "organization_affiliated": "Centre of Inflammation and Metabolism (CIM) and Centre for Physical Activity Research (CFAS), Rigshospitalet, University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark"}

Infiltration, accumulation, and survival of chimeric antigen receptor T (CART) cells in solid tumors is crucial for tumor clearance. We engineered CART cells to express interleukin (IL)7 and CCL19 (7  19 CART cells), as these factors are essential for the maintenance of Tcell zones in lymphoid organs. In mice, 7  19 CART cells achieved complete regression of preestablished solid tumors and prolonged mouse survival, with superior antitumor activity compared to conventional CART cells. Histopathological analyses showed increased infiltration of dendritic cells (DC) and T cells into tumor tissues following 7  19 CART cell therapy. Depletion of recipient T cells before 7  19 CART cell administration dampened the therapeutic effects of 7  19 CART cell treatment, suggesting that CART cells and recipient immune cells collaborated to exert antitumor activity.

However, the stateoftheart CHCD exchange using noble metal catalysts or strong basesacids suffers from poor functional group tolerances, poor selectivity and lack of scope for generating molecular complexity. Herein, we demonstrate the deuteration of halides using heavy water as the deuteration reagent and porous CdSe nanosheets as the catalyst. The deuteration mechanism involves the generation of highly active carbon and deuterium radicals via photoinduced electron transfer from CdSe to the substrates, followed by tandem radicals coupling process, which is mechanistically distinct from the traditional methods involving deuterium cations or anions. Our deuteration strategy shows better selectivity and functional group tolerances than current CHCD exchange methods. Extending the synthetic scope, deuterated boronic acids, halides, alkynes, and aldehydes can be used as synthons in Suzuki coupling, Click reaction, CH bond insertion reaction etc. for the synthesis of complex deuterated molecules. Developing convenient deuterium labeling procedures is important in organic synthesis and the pharmaceutical industry.

However, targeting APOBEC3B high NSCLC is still a big challenge. Here we show that APOBEC3B upregulation is significantly associated with immune gene expression, and APOBEC3B expression positively correlates with known immunotherapy response biomarkers, including: PDL1 expression and Tcell infiltration in NSCLC. Importantly, APOBEC mutational signature is specifically enriched in NSCLC patients with durable clinical benefit after immunotherapy and APOBEC mutation count can be better than total mutation in predicting immunotherapy response.

We classified the possible explanations for the discrepancies into three categories: the time interval between the two tests, the technical limitations of WES, and the impact of the sequencing system type. This cohort comprised 108 patients with negative array comparative genomic hybridization and negative or inconclusive WES results before WGS was performed. Ten (9%) patients had positive WGS results. However, after reanalysis the WGS hit rate decreased to 7% (7 cases). In four cases the variants were identified by WES but missed for different reasons. Only 3 cases (3%) were positive by WGS but completely unidentified by WES. In this study, we showed that 30% of the positive cases identified by WGS could be identified by reanalyzing the WES raw data, and WGS achieved an only 7% higher detection rate.

The resulting thermal stress can lead to breakdown of the coralalgal symbiosis, essential for the functioning of reefs, and cause coral bleaching. Mass coral bleaching is a modern phenomenon associated with increases in reef temperatures due to recent global warming. Widespread bleaching has typically occurred during El Nino events. We examine the historical level of stress for 100 coral reef locations with robust bleaching histories. The level of thermal stress (based on a degree heating month index, DHMI) at these locations during the 20152016 El Nino was unprecedented over the period 18712017 and exceeded that of the strong 19971998 El Nino. The DHMI was also 5 times the level of thermal stress associated with the 'preindustrial', 18771878, El Nino. Coral reefs have, therefore, already shown their vulnerability to the modest (~0.92 C) global warming that has occurred to date. Estimates of future levels of thermal stress suggest that even the optimistic 1.5 C Paris Agreement target is insufficient to prevent more frequent mass bleaching events for the world's reefs.

Modular and flexible platforms for fabrication of such multicellular modules and their characterization have been lacking. Here, we present a modular cellular system, made up of multilayered tissue rings containing integrated skeletal muscle and motor neurons (MNs) embedded in an extracellular matrix. The MNs were differentiated from mouse embryonic stem cells through the formation of embryoid bodies (EBs), which are spherical aggregations of cells grown in a suspension culture. The EBs were integrated into a tissue ring with skeletal muscle, which was differentiated in parallel, to create a coculture amenable to both cell types. The multilayered rings were then sequentially placed on a stationary threedimensionalprinted hydrogel structure resembling an anatomical muscletendonbone organization. We demonstrate that the sitespecific innervation of a group of muscle fibers in the multilayered tissue rings allows for muscle contraction via chemical stimulation of MNs with glutamate, a major excitatory neurotransmitter in the mammalian nervous system, with the frequency of contraction increasing with glutamate concentration. The addition of tubocurarine chloride (a nicotinic receptor antagonist) halted the contractions, indicating that muscle contraction was MN induced. With a biofabricated system permitting controllable mechanical and geometric attributes in a range of length scales, our novel engineered cellular system can be utilized for easier integration of other modular \"building blocks\" in living cellular and biological machines. A 3Dprinted structure made by US researchers can be used to grow engineered muscles that contract under the control of motor neurons. To perform various tasks, living organisms require different cell types to interacta situation that functional modules of synthetic biological machines must emulate. To assemble one such module, Rashid Bashir and his coworkers at the University of Illinois differentiated motor neurons from mouse embryonic stem cells. They then integrated these neurons into a ring of skeletal muscle tissue on a 3Dprinted hydrogel structure that mimics a junction of muscle, tendon and bone. The neurons grew extensions into the muscle, enabling the muscles to contract and relax when the neurons were stimulated by common biological chemicals. This modular cellular system could help to build microscale models of neurodegenerative diseases or be used in drug screening.", "authors": "Caroline Cvetkovic; Max H.

Some of the same mutations in SMCHD1 are known to cause a phenotypically distinct muscular dystrophy disorder, FSHD2, and the distinct clinical features of the two disorders suggests that additional genes interact with SMCHD1 to cause arhinia. Arhinia, or absence of the nose, is a rare malformation of unknown etiology that is often accompanied by ocular and reproductive defects. Sequencing of 40 people with arhinia revealed that 84% of probands harbor a missense mutation localized to a constrained region of SMCHD1 encompassing the ATPase domain. SMCHD1 mutations cause facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy type 2 (FSHD2) via a transacting lossoffunction epigenetic mechanism. We discovered shared mutations and comparable DNA hypomethylation patterning between these distinct disorders. CRISPRCas9mediated alteration of smchd1 in zebrafish yielded arhiniarelevant phenotypes. Transcriptome and protein analyses in arhinia probands and controls showed no differences in SMCHD1 mRNA or protein abundance but revealed regulatory changes in genes and pathways associated with craniofacial patterning. Mutations in SMCHD1 thus contribute to distinct phenotypic spectra, from craniofacial malformation and reproductive disorders to muscular dystrophy, which we speculate to be consistent with oligogenic mechanisms resulting in pleiotropic outcomes.", "authors": "Natalie D Shaw;

Despite a high genetic heterogeneity (60 causative genes), 4070% of the families remain without a molecular diagnosis. Analysis of one of the pioneer cohorts of 193 HSP families generated in the early 1990s in Portugal highlighted that SPAST and SPG11 are the most frequent diagnoses. We have now explored 98 unsolved families from this series using custom next generation sequencing panels analyzing up to 70 candidate HSP genes. We identified the likely diseasecausing variant in 20 of the 98 families with KIF5A being the most frequently mutated gene. We also found 52 variants of unknown significance (VUS) in 38% of the cases. These new diagnoses resulted in 42% of solved cases in the full Portuguese cohort (81193). Segregation of the variants was not always compatible with the presumed inheritance, indicating that the analysis of all HSP genes regardless of the inheritance mode can help to explain some cases. Our results show that there is still a large set of unknown genes responsible for HSP and most likely novel mechanisms or inheritance modes leading to the disease to be uncovered, but this will require international collaborative efforts, particularly for the analysis of VUS.", "authors": "Sara Morais; Laure Raymond; Mathilde Mairey; Paula Coutinho; Eva Brandao; Paula Ribeiro; Jose Leal Loureiro; Jorge Sequeiros; Alexis Brice; Isabel Alonso; Giovanni Stevanin", "keywords": "Genetics research; Neurological disorders", "organization_affiliated": "UnIGENe, Instituto de Biologia Molecular e Celular (IBMC), Universidade do Porto, Portugal; Instituto de Investigacao e Inovacao em Saude, Universidade do Porto, Portugal; Instituto de Ciencias Biomedicas de Abel Salazar (ICBAS), Universidade do Porto, Portugal; INSERM, U 1127, Paris, France; CNRS, UMR 7225, Paris, France; Sorbonne Universites, UPMC Univ Paris 06, UMRS_1127, Paris, France; Institut du Cerveau et de la Moelle epiniere, ICM, Paris, France; Ecole Pratique des Hautes Etudes, EPHE, PSL Research University, Paris, France; INSERM, U 1127, Paris, France; CNRS, UMR 7225, Paris, France; Sorbonne Universites, UPMC Univ Paris 06, UMRS_1127, Paris, France; Institut du Cerveau et de la Moelle epiniere, ICM, Paris, France; Ecole Pratique des Hautes Etudes, EPHE, PSL Research University, Paris, France; INSERM, U 1127, Paris, France; CNRS, UMR 7225, Paris, France; Sorbonne Universites, UPMC Univ Paris 06, UMRS_1127, Paris, France; Institut du Cerveau et de la Moelle epiniere, ICM, Paris, France; Ecole Pratique des Hautes Etudes, EPHE, PSL Research University, Paris, France; UnIGENe, Instituto de Biologia Molecular e Celular (IBMC), Universidade do Porto, Portugal; Instituto de Investigacao e Inovacao em Saude, Universidade do Porto, Portugal; Servico de Neurologia, Centro Hospitalar de Entre o Douro e Vouga, Santa Maria da Feira, Portugal; Servico de Neurologia, Centro Hospitalar de Entre o Douro e Vouga, Santa Maria da Feira, Portugal; UnIGENe, Instituto de Biologia Molecular e Celular (IBMC), Universidade do Porto, Portugal; Instituto de Investigacao e Inovacao em Saude, Universidade do Porto, Portugal; Servico de Neurologia, Centro Hospitalar de Entre o Douro e Vouga, Santa Maria da Feira, Portugal; UnIGENe, Instituto de Biologia Molecular e Celular (IBMC), Universidade do Porto, Portugal; Instituto de Investigacao e Inovacao em Saude, Universidade do Porto, Portugal; Instituto de Ciencias Biomedicas de Abel Salazar (ICBAS), Universidade do Porto, Portugal; INSERM, U 1127, Paris, France; CNRS, UMR 7225, Paris, France; Sorbonne Universites, UPMC Univ Paris 06, UMRS_1127, Paris, France; Institut du Cerveau et de la Moelle epiniere, ICM, Paris, France; Departement de Genetique, APHP, Hopital de la PitieSalpetriere, Paris, France; UnIGENe, Instituto de Biologia Molecular e Celular (IBMC), Universidade do Porto, Portugal; Instituto de Investigacao e Inovacao em Saude, Universidade do Porto, Portugal; Instituto de Ciencias Biomedicas de Abel Salazar (ICBAS), Universidade do Porto, Portugal; INSERM, U 1127, Paris, France; CNRS, UMR 7225, Paris, France; Sorbonne Universites, UPMC Univ Paris 06, UMRS_1127, Paris, France; Institut du Cerveau et de la Moelle epiniere, ICM, Paris, France; Ecole Pratique des Hautes Etudes, EPHE, PSL Research University, Paris, France; Departement de Genetique, APHP, Hopital de la PitieSalpetriere, Paris, France"}

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by severe neuronal loss; however, the mechanisms by which neurons die remain elusive. Necroptosis, a programmed form of necrosis, is executed by the mixed lineage kinase domainlike (MLKL) protein, which is triggered by receptorinteractive protein kinases (RIPK) 1 and 3. We found that necroptosis was activated in postmortem human AD brains, positively correlated with Braak stage, and inversely correlated with brain weight and cognitive scores. In addition, we found that the set of genes regulated by RIPK1 overlapped significantly with multiple independent AD transcriptomic signatures, indicating that RIPK1 activity could explain a substantial portion of transcriptomic changes in AD. Furthermore, we observed that lowering necroptosis activation reduced cell loss in a mouse model of AD.

The diapycnal and isopycnal mixing experiment in the Southern Ocean found the turbulent diffusivity inferred from the vertical spreading of a tracer to be an order of magnitude larger than that inferred from the microstructure profiles at the mean tracer depth of 1,500 m in the Drake Passage. Using a highresolution ocean model, it is shown that the fast vertical spreading of tracer occurs when it comes in contact with mixing hotspots over rough topography. The sparsity of such hotspots is made up for by enhanced tracer residence time in their vicinity due to diffusion toward weak bottom flows. The increased tracer residence time may explain the large vertical fluxes of heat and salt required to close the abyssal circulation. Turbulent mixing next to rough topographic features is believed to be key in the closure of the abyssal ocean circulation. Here, using Southern Ocean data, the authors show that mixing hotspots trap fluid and mix it for long periods, explaining the global impact of relatively few mixing hotspots.", "authors": "A.

The strategies devised thus far in an attempt to rectify this issue all present drawbacks. Our research uncovers a unique approach based on the use of a lithiated organic material, namely 3,4dihydroxybenzonitrile dilithium salt. This compound can irreversibly provide lithium cations to the graphite electrode during an initial operando charging step without any negative effects with respect to further operation of the LIC. This method not only restores the low CO2 footprint of LICs, but also possesses farreaching potential with respect to designing a wide range of greener hybrid devices based on other chemistries, comprising entirely recyclable components.

Until now, phytoplankton have been considered as passive subjects to ocean turbulence, which can change as suddenly as nutrient and light availability in the dynamic underwater environment. Roman Stocker and colleagues now show that several species of phytoplankton actively respond to turbulent cues by altering their migration routes to avoid layers of strong turbulence. They report that phytoplankton split into two groups, one swimming upward and another downward. This migratory behaviour could affect which species will survive in a changing ocean and will contribute to understanding of how communities respond to a warming climate. Marine phytoplankton inhabit a dynamic environment where turbulence, together with nutrient and light availability, shapes species fitness, succession and selection1,2. Many species of phytoplankton are motile and undertake diel vertical migrations to gain access to nutrientrich deeper layers at night and welllit surface waters during the day3,4. Disruption of this migratory strategy by turbulence is considered to be an important cause of the succession between motile and nonmotile species when conditions turn turbulent1,5,6. However, this classical view neglects the possibility that motile species may actively respond to turbulent cues to avoid layers of strong turbulence7. Here we report that phytoplankton, including raphidophytes and dinoflagellates, can actively diversify their migratory strategy in response to hydrodynamic cues characteristic of overturning by Kolmogorovscale eddies. Upon experiencing repeated overturning with timescales and statistics representative of ocean turbulence, an upwardswimming population rapidly (560 min) splits into two subpopulations, one swimming upward and one swimming downward. Quantitative morphological analysis of the harmfulalgalbloomforming raphidophyte Heterosigma akashiwo together with a model of cell mechanics revealed that this behaviour was accompanied by a modulation of the cells' foreaft asymmetry. The minute magnitude of the required modulation, sufficient to invert the preferential swimming direction of the cells, highlights the advanced level of control that phytoplankton can exert on their migratory behaviour. Together with observations of enhanced cellular stress after overturning and the typically deleterious effects of strong turbulence on motile phytoplankton5,8, these results point to an active adaptation of H. akashiwo to increase the chance of evading turbulent layers by diversifying the direction of migration within the population, in a manner suggestive of evolutionary bethedging. This migratory behaviour relaxes the boundaries between the fluid dynamic niches of motile and nonmotile phytoplankton, and highlights that rapid responses to hydrodynamic cues are important survival strategies for phytoplankton in the ocean.", "authors": "Anupam Sengupta; Francesco Carrara; Roman Stocker", "keywords": "Behavioural ecology; Colloids; Fluid dynamics; Marine biology; Motility", "organization_affiliated": "Department of Civil, Institute for Environmental Engineering, Environmental and Geomatic Engineering, ETH Zurich, Switzerland; Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Ralph M.

Recent studies have revealed how Piezo1 protein senses mechanical force to enable vascular development. Here, we address Piezo1 in adult endothelium, the major control site in physical activity. Mice without endothelial Piezo1 lack obvious phenotype but close inspection reveals a specific effect on endotheliumdependent relaxation in mesenteric resistance artery. Strikingly, the Piezo1 is required for elevated blood pressure during whole body physical activity but not blood pressure during inactivity. Piezo1 is responsible for flowsensitive noninactivating nonselective cationic channels which depolarize the membrane potential. As fluid flow increases, depolarization increases to activate voltagegated Ca2 channels in the adjacent vascular smooth muscle cells, causing vasoconstriction. Physical performance is compromised in mice which lack endothelial Piezo1 and there is weight loss after sustained activity. The data suggest that Piezo1 channels sense physical activity to advantageously reset vascular control. The mechanisms that regulate the body's response to exercise are poorly understood.

This Review discusses the wide diversity of vertebrate sexdetermination mechanisms, their rapid evolution under different forms of genetic and environmental control and the overarching principles that are shared despite this mechanistic diversity. The discovery of the Sry gene in 1990 triggered a revolution in our understanding of sex determination. More recently, advances in nonmodel organisms have been fuelled by the rapid evolution of affordable genome and transcriptome technologies. This Review considers the unusual plasticity in the bipotential system of sex determination and some of the diverse mechanisms that have evolved to control this critical developmental decision, including strong genetic pathways, environmental influences and epigenetic regulation. Ideas emerging from model and nonmodel organisms that suggest that sex determination operates as an antagonistic network with the emergent property of bistability are discussed.", "authors": "Blanche Capel", "keywords": "Chromosomes; Development; Differentiation; Evolutionary developmental biology; Gene regulation; Germline development; Sexual dimorphism", "organization_affiliated": "Department of Cell Biology, 452 Nanaline Duke, 307 Research Drive, Duke University Medical Center, Durham, USA"}

Yet they present an appealing target because of their desirable physical and electronic properties. Here we report the preparation of a 2D conjugated aromatic polymer synthesized via CC coupling reactions between tetrabromopolyaromatic monomers. Prearranged monomers in the bulk crystal undergo CC coupling driven by endogenous solidstate polymerization to produce a crystalline polymer, which can be mechanically exfoliated into micrometresized lamellar sheets with a thickness of 1 nm. Isothermal gassorption measurements of the bulk material reveal a dominant pore size of ~0.6 nm, which indicates uniform open channels from the eclipsed stacking of the sheets. When employed as an organic anode in an ambienttemperature sodium cell, the material allows a fast chargedischarge of sodium ions, with impressive reversible capacity, rate capability and stability metrics. The synthesis of welldefined planar polymers presents a significant challenge for chemists seeking to investigate their potential for use in emerging technologies.

Biosynthesis of OXTA has been linked to a plasmidborne Bacillus megaterium gene cluster that contains four genes: oxsA, oxsB, oxrA and oxrB. Here we show that both the oxsA and oxsB genes are required for the production of OXTA. Biochemical analysis of the encoded proteins, a cobalamin (Cbl)dependent Sadenosylmethionine (AdoMet) radical enzyme, OxsB, and an HDdomain phosphohydrolase, OxsA, reveals that OXTA is derived from a 2deoxyadenosine phosphate in an OxsBcatalysed ring contraction reaction initiated by hydrogen atom abstraction from C2. Hence, OxsB represents the first biochemically characterized nonmethylating Cbldependent AdoMet radical enzyme. Xray analysis of OxsB reveals the fold of a Cbldependent AdoMet radical enzyme, a family of enzymes with an estimated 7,000 members. Overall, this work provides a framework for understanding the interplay of AdoMet and Cbl cofactors and expands the catalytic repertoire of Cbldependent AdoMet radical enzymes. The biosynthesis of oxetanocin A involves OxsB, a B12dependent Sadenosylmethionine radical enzyme, which catalyses an unusual ring contraction of a 2deoxyadenosine phosphate. OxetanocinA (OXTA) and its oxetaneringcontaining derivatives have been shown to be potent inhibitors of DNA viruses, as well as having antitumour and antibacterial activity. Oxetanes can be prepared synthetically, but how these fourmembered, oxygencontaining rings are naturally formed is unknown. This work outlines the biosynthesis of OXTA, which involves OxsB, a B12dependent Sadenosylmethionine (SAM) radical enzyme. OxsB catalyses an unusual ring contraction from AMP. The crystal structure of OxsB represents the first of a B12dependent SAM enzyme, of which there are around 7,000 members, and reveals how it can accommodate the B12 and ironsulfur cluster at the active site.", "authors": "Jennifer BridwellRabb; Aoshu Zhong; He G.

Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) can differentiate into chondrocytes, while mechanical loading has been proposed as alternative strategy to induce chondrogenesis excluding the use of exogenous factors. Moreover, MSC supporting material selection is fundamental to allow for an active interaction with cells. Here, we tested a novel thermoreversible hydrogel composed of 8% wv methylcellulose (MC) in a 0.05 M Na2SO4 solution. MC hydrogel was obtained by dispersion technique and its thermoreversibility, mechanical properties, degradation and swelling were investigated, demonstrating a solutiongelation transition between 34 and 37 C and a low bulk degradation (20%) after 1 month. The lack of any hydrogelderived immunoreaction was demonstrated in vivo by mice subcutaneous implantation. To induce in vitro chondrogenesis, MSCs were seeded into MC solution retained within a porous polyurethane (PU) matrix. PUMC composites were subjected to a combination of compression and shear forces for 21 days in a custom made bioreactor. Mechanical stimulation led to a significant increase in chondrogenic gene expression, while histological analysis detected sulphated glycosaminoglycans and collagen II only in loaded specimens, confirming MC hydrogel suitability to support load induced MSCs chondrogenesis.", "authors": "A.

Here, we report that this antibody sharply reduces adipose tissue in wildtype mice, phenocopying genetic haploinsufficiency for the Fsh receptor gene Fshr. The antibody also causes profound beiging, increases cellular mitochondrial density, activates brown adipose tissue and enhances thermogenesis. These actions result from the specific binding of the antibody to the subunit of Fsh to block its action. Our studies uncover opportunities for simultaneously treating obesity and osteoporosis. An antibody against the pituitary hormone Fsh reduces adiposity and increases thermogenesis in ovariectomized mice or mice fed a highfat diet. Menopause is associated with bone loss and enhanced buildup of abdominal fat. Previously, Mone Zaidi and colleagues showed that an antibody against the pituitary hormone Fsh increases bone mass in mice. In this paper, they show that this antibody also reduces fatty tissue in mice that have had their ovaries removed or mice on a high fat diet. The antiobesity effect is accompanied by increases in UCP1 expression and thermogenesis in brown and beige fat, increased wholebody oxygen consumption rate and physical activity.

ESCRTIII is thought to form persistent filaments that over time increase their curvature to constrict membranes. Unexpectedly, we found that ESCRTIII at the midbody of human cells rapidly turns over subunits with cytoplasmic pools while gradually forming larger assemblies. ESCRTIII turnover depended on the ATPase VPS4, which accumulated at the midbody simultaneously with ESCRTIII subunits, and was required for assembly of functional ESCRTIII structures. In vitro, the Vps2Vps24 subunits of ESCRTIII formed sidebyside filaments with Snf7 and inhibited further polymerization, but the growth inhibition was alleviated by the addition of Vps4 and ATP. Highspeed atomic force microscopy further revealed highly dynamic arrays of growing and shrinking ESCRTIII spirals in the presence of Vps4. Continuous ESCRTIII remodelling by subunit turnover might facilitate shape adaptions to variable membrane geometries, with broad implications for diverse cellular processes. Mierzwa et al. show that ESCRTIII subunit turnover at the cell midbody is driven by Vps4.

To better understand transcriptional regulation during human oogenesis and preimplantation development, we defined stagespecific transcription, which highlighted the cleavage stage as being highly distinctive. Here, we present multiple lines of evidence that a eutherianspecific multicopy retrogene, DUX4, encodes a transcription factor that activates hundreds of endogenous genes (for example, ZSCAN4, KDM4E and PRAMEFfamily genes) and retroviral elements (MERVLHERVL family) that define the cleavagespecific transcriptional programs in humans and mice. Remarkably, mouse Dux expression is both necessary and sufficient to convert mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) into 2cellembryolike ('2Clike') cells, measured here by the reactivation of '2C' genes and repeat elements, the loss of POU5F1 (also known as OCT4) protein and chromocenters, and the conversion of the chromatin landscape (as assessed by transposaseaccessible chromatin using sequencing (ATACseq)) to a state strongly resembling that of mouse 2C embryos.

Here we introduce multimodal sensors with important capabilities in this context, rendered in soft, ultrathin, 'skinlike' formats with numerous advantages over alternative technologies, including the ability to establish intimate, conformal contact without applied pressure, and to provide spatiotemporally resolved data on both electrical and thermal transport properties from sensitive regions of the skin. Systematic in vitro studies and computational models establish the underlying measurement principles and associated approaches for determination of temperature, thermal conductivity, thermal diffusivity, volumetric heat capacity, and electrical impedance using simple analysis algorithms. Clinical studies on 20 patients subjected to a variety of external stimuli validate the device operation and allow quantitative comparisons of measurement capabilities to those of existing stateoftheart tools. A new type of sensor that is practically imperceptible to the wearer could help to track changes in skin hydration. A team in the United States, led by John Rogers at Northwestern University, Illinois, and Rafal Pielak from the L'Oreal Tech Incubator, California, fabricated small patches that can read both thermal and electrical properties of the skin. Studies with porcine skin and computational models enabled the researchers to determine how to collect such measurements and turn them into a useful metric of skin hydration. The team then tested the device on 20 people treated with creams containing varying levels of glycerin, a skin moisturizer. The sensor performed just as well as existing technologies but was also more convenient to use. It could help companies to test skin products or enable athome skin monitoring.", "authors": "Siddharth Krishnan; Yunzhou Shi; R. Chad Webb; Yinji Ma; Philippe Bastien; Kaitlyn E.

Owing to the role of FGF23 in renal phosphate handling and vitamin D synthesis, TIO is characterized by decreased renal tubular reabsorption of phosphate, by hypophosphataemia and by low levels of active vitamin D. Chronic hypophosphataemia ultimately results in osteomalacia (that is, inadequate bone mineralization). The diagnosis of TIO is usually suspected when serum phosphate levels are chronically low in the setting of bone pain, fragility fractures and muscle weakness. Locating the offending tumour can be very difficult, as the tumour is often very small and can be anywhere in the body. Surgical removal of the tumour is the only definitive treatment. When the tumour cannot be located or when complete resection is not possible, medical treatment with phosphate salts or active vitamin D is necessary. One of the most promising emerging treatments for unresectable tumours that cause TIO is the antiFGF23 monoclonal antibody KRN23. The recent identification of a fusion of fibronectin and fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 (FGFR1) as a molecular driver in some tumours not only sheds light on the pathophysiology of TIO but also opens the door to a better understanding of the transcription, translocation, posttranslational modification and secretion of FGF23, as well as suggesting approaches to targeted therapy. Further study will reveal if the FGFR1 pathway is also involved in tumours that do not harbour the translocation. Tumourinduced osteomalacia (TIO), also known as oncogenic osteomalacia, is a rare paraneoplastic disorder caused by tumours that secrete fibroblast growth factor 23. Clinically, TIO is associated with hypophosphataemia and skeletal abnormalities.

While broadly crossreactive, protective monoclonal antibodies against the haemagglutinin of influenza B viruses have been described, none targeting the neuraminidase, the second most abundant viral glycoprotein, have been reported. Here, we analyse a panel of five murine antineuraminidase monoclonal antibodies that demonstrate broad binding, neuraminidase inhibition, in vitro antibodydependent cellmediated cytotoxicity and in vivo protection against influenza B viruses belonging to both haemagglutinin lineages and spanning over 70 years of antigenic drift. Electron microscopic analysis of two neuraminidaseantibody complexes shows that the conserved neuraminidase epitopes are located on the head of the molecule and that they are distinct from the enzymatic active site. In the mouse model, one therapeutic dose of antibody 1F2 was more protective than the current standard of treatment, oseltamivir, given twice daily for six days.

Although information is not lost, its recovery requires a coherent interferometric reconstruction of the original signals, which have been scrambled into the modes of the scattering system. Here we show that we can automatically unscramble optical beams that have been arbitrarily mixed in a multimode waveguide, undoing the scattering and mixing between the spatial modes through a mesh of silicon photonics tuneable beam splitters. Transparent light detectors integrated in a photonic chip are used to directly monitor the evolution of each mode along the mesh, allowing sequential tuning and adaptive individual feedback control of each beam splitter. The entire mesh selfconfigures automatically through a progressive tuning algorithm and resets itself after significantly perturbing the mixing, without turning off the beams. We demonstrate information recovery by the simultaneous unscrambling, sorting and tracking of four mixed modes, with residual crosstalk of 20 dB between the beams. Circuit partitioning assisted by transparent detectors enables scalability to meshes with a higher port count and to a higher number of modes without a proportionate increase in the control complexity. The principle of selfconfiguring and selfresetting in optical systems should be applicable in a wide range of optical applications. A silicon photonics chip featuring a mesh of tunable beam splitters can unscramble mode mixing that occurs in multimode waveguides. Scattering or multimode systems can randomize the spatial coherence of light beams. Francesco Morichetti and coworkers from Politecnico di Milano, Italy, and Stanford University, USA, have fabricated a chipbased descrambler that can automatically unscramble optical beams. A progressive tuning algorithm that monitors the output of the chip enables the mesh to selfconfigure so that it can unscramble and sort different spatial modes. In a demonstration of the device, four optical beams containing mixed modes were unmixed and separated into outputs with a residual crosstalk of less than 20 dB between the modes. The approach is scalable to a higher number of modes and is promising for optical communication systems employing mode division multiplexing.", "authors": "Andrea Annoni; Emanuele Guglielmi; Marco Carminati; Giorgio Ferrari; Marco Sampietro; David AB Miller; Andrea Melloni; Francesco Morichetti", "keywords": "Integrated optics; Photonic devices; Silicon photonics", "organization_affiliated": "Dipartimento di Elettronica, Informazione e Bioingegneria, Politecnico di Milano, Milano, Italy; Dipartimento di Elettronica, Informazione e Bioingegneria, Politecnico di Milano, Milano, Italy; Dipartimento di Elettronica, Informazione e Bioingegneria, Politecnico di Milano, Milano, Italy; Dipartimento di Elettronica, Informazione e Bioingegneria, Politecnico di Milano, Milano, Italy; Dipartimento di Elettronica, Informazione e Bioingegneria, Politecnico di Milano, Milano, Italy; Ginzton Laboratory, Stanford University, Spilker Building, Stanford, USA; Dipartimento di Elettronica, Informazione e Bioingegneria, Politecnico di Milano, Milano, Italy; Dipartimento di Elettronica, Informazione e Bioingegneria, Politecnico di Milano, Milano, Italy"}

They identify Tnni3k as one gene that contributes to the observed variation and validate its role through mouse knockout and zebrafish overexpression studies. Adult mammalian cardiomyocyte regeneration after injury is thought to be minimal. Mononuclear diploid cardiomyocytes (MNDCMs), a relatively small subpopulation in the adult heart, may account for the observed degree of regeneration, but this has not been tested. We surveyed 120 inbred mouse strains and found that the frequency of adult mononuclear cardiomyocytes was surprisingly variable (7fold). Cardiomyocyte proliferation and heart functional recovery after coronary artery ligation both correlated with preinjury MNDCM content. Using genomewide association, we identified Tnni3k as one gene that influences variation in this composition and demonstrated that Tnni3k knockout resulted in elevated MNDCM content and increased cardiomyocyte proliferation after injury. Reciprocally, overexpression of Tnni3k in zebrafish promoted cardiomyocyte polyploidization and compromised heart regeneration. Our results corroborate the relevance of MNDCMs in heart regeneration. Moreover, they imply that intrinsic heart regeneration is not limited nor uniform in all individuals, but rather is a variable trait influenced by multiple genes.", "authors": "Michaela Patterson; Lindsey Barske; Ben Van Handel; Christoph D Rau; Peiheng Gan; Avneesh Sharma; Shan Parikh; Matt Denholtz; Ying Huang; Yukiko Yamaguchi; Hua Shen; Hooman Allayee; J Gage Crump; Thomas I Force; ChingLing Lien; Takako Makita; Aldons J Lusis; S Ram Kumar; Henry M Sucov", "keywords": "Developmental biology; Genetics; Stem cells", "organization_affiliated": "Department of Stem Cell Biology and Regenerative Medicine, Keck School of Medicine, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, USA; Department of Stem Cell Biology and Regenerative Medicine, Keck School of Medicine, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, USA; Department of Stem Cell Biology and Regenerative Medicine, Keck School of Medicine, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, USA; Department of Human Genetics, David Geffen School of Medicine, University of California Los Angeles, Los Angeles, USA; Department of Stem Cell Biology and Regenerative Medicine, Keck School of Medicine, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, USA; Department of Stem Cell Biology and Regenerative Medicine, Keck School of Medicine, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, USA; Division of Cardiovascular Medicine, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, USA; Department of Biological Chemistry, David Geffen School of Medicine, University of California Los Angeles, Los Angeles, USA; Program of Developmental Biology and Regenerative Medicine, The Saban Research Institute, Children's Hospital Los Angeles, Los Angeles, USA; Department of Stem Cell Biology and Regenerative Medicine, Keck School of Medicine, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, USA; Department of Stem Cell Biology and Regenerative Medicine, Keck School of Medicine, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, USA; Department of Preventive Medicine, Keck School of Medicine, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, USA; Department of Stem Cell Biology and Regenerative Medicine, Keck School of Medicine, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, USA; Division of Cardiovascular Medicine, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, USA; Program of Developmental Biology and Regenerative Medicine, The Saban Research Institute, Children's Hospital Los Angeles, Los Angeles, USA; Department of Surgery, Keck School of Medicine, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, USA; Developmental Neuroscience Program, The Saban Research Institute, Children's Hospital Los Angeles, Los Angeles, USA; Department of Pediatrics, Keck School of Medicine, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, USA; Department of Human Genetics, David Geffen School of Medicine, University of California Los Angeles, Los Angeles, USA; Department of Surgery, Keck School of Medicine, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, USA; Department of Stem Cell Biology and Regenerative Medicine, Keck School of Medicine, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, USA"}

We examined this question in the context of visualmotion processing in the retina and primary visual cortex (V1) of mice. We disrupted retinal direction selectivity, either exclusively along the horizontal axis using FRMD7 mutants or along all directions by ablating starburst amacrine cells, and monitored neuronal activity in layer 23 of V1 during stimulation with visual motion. In control mice, we found an overrepresentation of cortical cells preferring posterior visual motion, the dominant motion direction an animal experiences when it moves forward.

Hepatic ischemiareperfusion (IR) injury is a common clinical issue lacking effective therapy and validated pharmacological targets. Here, using integrative 'omics' analysis, we identified an arachidonate 12lipoxygenase (ALOX12)12hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (12HETE)Gproteincoupled receptor 31 (GPR31) signaling axis as a key determinant of the hepatic IR process. We found that ALOX12 was markedly upregulated in hepatocytes during ischemia to promote 12HETE accumulation and that 12HETE then directly binds to GPR31, triggering an inflammatory response that exacerbates liver damage. Notably, blocking 12HETE production inhibits IRinduced liver dysfunction, inflammation and cell death in mice and pigs. Furthermore, we established a nonhuman primate hepatic IR model that closely recapitulates clinical liver dysfunction following liver resection. Most strikingly, blocking 12HETE accumulation effectively attenuated all pathologies of hepatic IR in this model. Collectively, this study has revealed previously uncharacterized metabolic reprogramming involving an ALOX1212HETEGPR31 axis that functionally determines hepatic IR procession.

Some of these features have been combined into an 'Immunoscore', which has been shown to complement the prognostic ability of the current TNM staging for early stage colorectal carcinomas. Features of the immune microenvironment are also potential therapeutic targets, and immune checkpoint inhibitors targeting the PD1PDL1 axis are especially promising. FDAapproved indications for antiPD1PDL1 are rapidly expanding across numerous tumor types and, in certain cases, are accompanied by companion or complimentary PDL1 immunohistochemical diagnostics. Pathologists have direct visual access to tumor tissue and indepth knowledge of the histological variations between and within tumor types and thus are poised to drive forward our understanding of the tumor microenvironment. This review summarizes the key components of the tumor microenvironment, presents an overview of and the challenges with PDL1 antibodies and assays, and addresses newer candidate biomarkers, such as CD8 cell density and mutational load. Characteristics of the local immune contexture and current pathologyrelated practices for specific tumor types are also addressed. In the future, characterization of the host antitumor immune response using multiplexed and multimodality biomarkers may help predict which patients will respond to immunebased therapies.", "authors": "Janis M Taube; Jerome Galon; Lynette M Sholl; Scott J Rodig; Tricia R Cottrell; Nicolas A Giraldo; Alexander S Baras; Sanjay S Patel; Robert A Anders; David L Rimm; Ashley CiminoMathews", "keywords": "Cancer microenvironment", "organization_affiliated": "Department of Dermatology, The Johns Hopkins University SOM and BloombergKimmel Institute for Immunotherapy, Baltimore; Department of Pathology, The Johns Hopkins University SOM and BloombergKimmel Institute for Immunotherapy, Baltimore, USA; Department of Oncology, The Johns Hopkins University SOM and BloombergKimmel Institute for Immunotherapy, Baltimore, USA; INSERM, Laboratory of Integrative Cancer Immunology, Paris, France; Universite Paris Descartes, Sorbonne Paris Cite, Paris, France; Sorbonne Universites, UPMC Univ Paris 06, Centre de Recherche des Cordeliers, Paris, France; Department of Pathology, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, USA; Department of Pathology, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, USA; Department of Pathology, The Johns Hopkins University SOM and BloombergKimmel Institute for Immunotherapy, Baltimore, USA; Department of Dermatology, The Johns Hopkins University SOM and BloombergKimmel Institute for Immunotherapy, Baltimore; Department of Pathology, The Johns Hopkins University SOM and BloombergKimmel Institute for Immunotherapy, Baltimore, USA; Department of Pathology, The Johns Hopkins University SOM and BloombergKimmel Institute for Immunotherapy, Baltimore, USA; Department of Pathology, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, USA; Department of Pathology, The Johns Hopkins University SOM and BloombergKimmel Institute for Immunotherapy, Baltimore, USA; Department of Pathology, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, USA; Department of Pathology, The Johns Hopkins University SOM and BloombergKimmel Institute for Immunotherapy, Baltimore, USA; Department of Oncology, The Johns Hopkins University SOM and BloombergKimmel Institute for Immunotherapy, Baltimore, USA"}

Curcumin, the principal curcuminoid of turmeric, has recently been identified as a main mediator of turmeric's medicinal properties. However, the inherent limitations of the compound itself, such as hydrophobicity, instability, poor absorption and rapid systemic elimination, pose big hurdles for translation to wider clinical application. We present here an approach for engineering curcumingelatinblended nanofibrous mats (NMs) by electrospinning to adequately enhance the bioavailability of the hydrophobic curcumin for wound repair. Curcumin was successfully formulated as an amorphous nanosolid dispersion and favorably released from gelatinbased biomimetic NMs that could be easily applied topically to experimental wounds. We show synergistic signaling by the released curcumin during the healing process: (i) mobilization of wound site fibroblasts by activating the Wnt signaling pathway, partly mediated through Dickkopfrelated protein1, and (ii) persistent inhibition of the inflammatory response through decreased expression of monocyte chemoattractant protein1 by fibroblasts. With a combination of these effects, the curcumingelatinblended NMs enhanced the regenerative process in a rat model of acute wounds, providing a method for translating this ancient medicine for use in modern wound therapy. Loading an ancient medicine onto gelatin nanofibres enhances the production of woundhealing and antiinflammatory agents in rat models. Turmeric, the main spice in curry powder, has been used to clean and manage injuries for thousands of years. Recent studies have identified curcumin as the responsible compound for many of its medicinal properties. Now, Xinyi Dai and Arndt Schilling from Germany's Technical University of Munich and University Medical Center Gottingen and colleagues have improved curcumin's bioavailability by electrospinning it with gelatin into a tissuemimicking network of crosslinked nanofibres. Xray measurements showed that this procedure turned normally crystalline curcumin into an amorphous dispersion with good solubility in cellular environments. Trials on rat skins revealed that the amorphous curcumin boosted the metabolism of beneficial fibroblast cells and helped regulate antiinflammation proteins for significantly faster wound healing. Schematic illustration of nanoformulated curcumin accelerates wound healing. (a) Curcumin nanoformulation through electrospinning greatly enhances its solubility. (b) Topically applied CurcuminGelatin nanofibrous mat releases bioactive curcumin to mobilize wound site fibroblasts by enhancing both cell proliferation and migration, a process partially mediated by Dickkopfrelated protein1regulated Wntcatenin pathway signaling. In the mean time, fibroblasts decreased the expression of monocyte chemoattractant protein1, leading to lasting inhibition of inflammatory response during the healing process. As a result, wound environment turns out to be more in favor of physiological healing, with faster reepithelialization, granulation tissue formation, as well as collagen deposition and matuaration from proliferative fibroblasts.\n                  \n                    \n                  \n                ", "authors": "Xinyi Dai; Juan Liu; Huaiyuan Zheng; Johannes Wichmann; Ursula Hopfner; Stefanie Sudhop; Carina Prein; Yi Shen; HansGunther Machens; Arndt F Schilling", "keywords": "Biomaterials  cells; Drug delivery", "organization_affiliated": "Department of Plastic Surgery and Hand Surgery, Faculty of Medicine, Klinikum Rechts der Isar, Technische Universitat Munchen, Munich, Germany; Clinic for Trauma Surgery, Orthopaedic Surgery and Plastic Surgery, University Medical Center, Gottingen, Germany; Department of Plastic Surgery and Hand Surgery, Faculty of Medicine, Klinikum Rechts der Isar, Technische Universitat Munchen, Munich, Germany; Department of Plastic Surgery and Hand Surgery, Faculty of Medicine, Klinikum Rechts der Isar, Technische Universitat Munchen, Munich, Germany; Department of Plastic Surgery and Hand Surgery, Faculty of Medicine, Klinikum Rechts der Isar, Technische Universitat Munchen, Munich, Germany; Department of Plastic Surgery and Hand Surgery, Faculty of Medicine, Klinikum Rechts der Isar, Technische Universitat Munchen, Munich, Germany; Department of Applied Sciences and Mechatronics, Center for Applied Tissue Engineering and Regenerative Medicine (CANTER), Munich University of Applied Sciences, Munich, Germany; Department of Applied Sciences and Mechatronics, Center for Applied Tissue Engineering and Regenerative Medicine (CANTER), Munich University of Applied Sciences, Munich, Germany; BioID Center, School of Biomedical Engineering, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China; Department of Plastic Surgery and Hand Surgery, Faculty of Medicine, Klinikum Rechts der Isar, Technische Universitat Munchen, Munich, Germany; Department of Plastic Surgery and Hand Surgery, Faculty of Medicine, Klinikum Rechts der Isar, Technische Universitat Munchen, Munich, Germany; Clinic for Trauma Surgery, Orthopaedic Surgery and Plastic Surgery, University Medical Center, Gottingen, Germany"}

Here, we show that infectionderived lipids 1palmitoyl2oleoylsnglycero3phosphoglycerol (POPG) and 1palmitoyl2oleoyl diacylglycerol (PODAG) stimulate the IMD pathway of ticks. The tick IMD network protects against colonization by three distinct bacteria, that is the Lyme disease spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi and the rickettsial agents Anaplasma phagocytophilum and A. marginale. Cell signalling ensues in the absence of transmembrane peptidoglycan recognition proteins and the adaptor molecules Fasassociated protein with a death domain (FADD) and IMD. Conversely, biochemical interactions occur between xlinked inhibitor of apoptosis protein (XIAP), an E3 ubiquitin ligase, and the E2 conjugating enzyme Bendless. We propose the existence of two functionally distinct IMD networks, one in insects and another in ticks. The insect IMD signalling pathway detects invading pathogens. Here the authors show that ticks have an alternative IMD system that lacks peptidoglycan receptors, IMD and FADD, and is instead reliant on interaction of the E3 ligase XIAP with the E2 conjugating enzyme Bendless.", "authors": "Dana K.

Calcium is an important signalling molecule in biology and its regulation has a key role in human physiology. The transient receptor potential vanilloid subfamily member 6 (TRPV6) channel is constitutively active and highly Caselective, mediating Ca(II) uptake in epithelial tissues, and its expression is related to several cancers. However, the structural basis for its constitutive activity and ion permeation is unknown. Here, Alexander Sobolevsky and colleagues report structures of human TRPV6 by cryoelectron microscopy in the open and closed states. These data reveal a novel gating mechanism for tetrameric ion channels, identifying an alanine hinge that is probably important in the role of TRPV6 in physiology and disease. Calciumselective transient receptor potential vanilloid subfamily member 6 (TRPV6) channels play a critical role in calcium uptake in epithelial tissues1,2,3,4. Altered TRPV6 expression is associated with a variety of human diseases5, including cancers6. TRPV6 channels are constitutively active1,7,8 and their open probability depends on the lipidic composition of the membrane in which they reside; it increases substantially in the presence of phosphatidylinositol 4,5bisphosphate7,9. Crystal structures of detergentsolubilized rat TRPV6 in the closed state have previously been solved10,11. Corroborating electrophysiological results3, these structures demonstrated that the Ca2 selectivity of TRPV6 arises from a ring of aspartate side chains in the selectivity filter that binds Ca2 tightly. However, how TRPV6 channels open and close their pores for ion permeation has remained unclear. Here we present cryoelectron microscopy structures of human TRPV6 in the open and closed states. The channel selectivity filter adopts similar conformations in both states, consistent with its explicit role in ion permeation. The irislike channel opening is accompanied by an tohelical transition in the porelining transmembrane helix S6 at an alanine hinge just below the selectivity filter. As a result of this transition, the S6 helices bend and rotate, exposing different residues to the ion channel pore in the open and closed states. This gating mechanism, which defines the constitutive activity of TRPV6, is, to our knowledge, unique among tetrameric ion channels and provides structural insights for understanding their diverse roles in physiology and disease.", "authors": "Luke L.

Here we show that ultrasmall clusters of copper selenide exhibit a disordered cationic sublattice under ambient conditions unlike larger nanocrystals, where Cu ions and vacancies form an ordered superstructure similar to the bulk solid. The clusters exhibit an unusual cationic sublattice arrangement wherein octahedral sites, which serve as bridges for cation migration, are stabilized by compressive strain. The roomtemperature liquidlike nature of the Cu sublattice combined with the actively tunable plasmonic properties of the Cu2Se clusters make them suitable as fast electrooptic switches.

Tumorigenesis begins long before the growth of a clinically detectable lesion and, indeed, even before any of the usual morphological correlates of premalignancy are recognizable. Field cancerization, which is the replacement of the normal cell population by a cancerprimed cell population that may show no morphological change, is now recognized to underlie the development of many types of cancer, including the common carcinomas of the lung, colon, skin, prostate and bladder. Field cancerization is the consequence of the evolution of somatic cells in the body that results in cells that carry some but not all phenotypes required for malignancy. Here, we review the evidence of field cancerization across organs and examine the biological mechanisms that drive the evolutionary process that results in field creation. We discuss the clinical implications, principally, how measurements of the cancerized field could improve cancer risk prediction in patients with premalignant disease.", "authors": "Kit Curtius; Nicholas A.

The vibrational excitations of nanostructures have a fundamental effect on their suitability for various electronic, optical and thermal applications. Maureen Lagos and colleagues probe these excitations, using stateoftheart electron microscopy to map the vibrational modes both at the surface and within the body of individual nanoparticles. Such information not only contributes to our knowledge of these fundamental vibrational modes, but will also be valuable for the design and optimization of nanostructures for practical use. Imaging of vibrational excitations in and near nanostructures is essential for developing lowloss infrared nanophotonics1, controlling heat transport in thermal nanodevices2,3, inventing new thermoelectric materials4 and understanding nanoscale energy transport. Spatially resolved electron energy loss spectroscopy has previously been used to image plasmonic behaviour in nanostructures in an electron microscope5,6, but hitherto it has not been possible to map vibrational modes directly in a single nanostructure, limiting our understanding of phonon coupling with photons7 and plasmons8. Here we present spatial mapping of optical and acoustic, bulk and surface vibrational modes in magnesium oxide nanocubes using an atomwide electron beam. We find that the energy and the symmetry of the surface polariton phonon modes depend on the size of the nanocubes, and that they are localized to the surfaces of the nanocube. We also observe a limiting of bulk phonon scattering in the presence of surface phonon modes. Most phonon spectroscopies are selectively sensitive to either surface or bulk excitations; therefore, by demonstrating the excitation of both bulk and surface vibrational modes using a single probe, our work represents advances in the detection and visualization of spatially confined surface and bulk phonons in nanostructures.", "authors": "Maureen J.

The generally accepted paradigm is that such aging is gradual and its origin is in slower than exponential microscopic dynamics, akin to the ones in supercooled liquids or glasses. Nevertheless, time and spaceresolved measurements have provided contrasting evidence: dynamics faster than exponential, intermittency and abrupt structural changes. Here we use 3D computer simulations of a microscopic model to reveal that the timescales governing stress relaxation, respectively, through thermal fluctuations and elastic recovery are key for the aging dynamics. When thermal fluctuations are too weak, stress heterogeneities frozenin upon solidification can still partially relax through elastically driven fluctuations. Such fluctuations are intermittent, because of strong correlations that persist over the timescale of experiments or simulations, leading to faster than exponential dynamics.

This distinction depends on whether the polymer influences charge or mass transport in the electrode. Although it is desirable to understand how to tailor the macromolecular design of a polymer to play a passive or active role, design rules are still lacking, as is a framework to assess the divergence in such behaviors. Here, we reveal the molecularlevel underpinnings that distinguish an active polyelectrolyte binder designed for lithiumsulfur batteries from a passive alternative. The binder, a cationic polyelectrolyte, is shown to both facilitate lithiumion transport through its reconfigurable network of mobile anions and restrict polysulfide diffusion from mesoporous carbon hosts by anion metathesis, which we show is selective for higher oligomers.

Electrophilic groups that target aminoacid nucleophiles have been used to create covalent ligands and drugs, but have, so far, been mainly limited to cysteine and serine. Here, we report a chemical proteomic platform for the global and quantitative analysis of lysine residues in native biological systems. We have quantified, in total, more than 9,000 lysines in human cell proteomes and have identified several hundred residues with heightened reactivity that are enriched at protein functional sites and can frequently be targeted by electrophilic small molecules. We have also discovered lysinereactive fragment electrophiles that inhibit enzymes by active site and allosteric mechanisms, as well as disrupt proteinprotein interactions in transcriptional regulatory complexes, emphasizing the broad potential and diverse functional consequences of liganding lysine residues throughout the human proteome. A chemical proteomic strategy has now been reported for the global profiling of lysine reactivity and ligandability. Using this approach, 9000 lysines in the human proteome were evaluated, leading to the discovery of hyperreactive lysines, and lysines that can be targeted by electrophilic small molecules to perturb enzyme function and proteinprotein interactions.", "authors": "Stephan M.

Current epigenetic therapies target the machinery that regulates these modifications, leading to global transcriptional reprogramming with the potential for extensive undesired effects. Epigenetic information can also be modified as a consequence of disrupting processive DNA replication. Here, we demonstrate that impeding replication by smallmoleculemediated stabilization of Gquadruplex nucleic acid secondary structures triggers local epigenetic plasticity. We report the use of the BU1 locus of chicken DT40 cells to screen for small molecules able to induce Gquadruplexdependent transcriptional reprogramming. Further characterization of the top hit compound revealed its ability to induce a dosedependent inactivation of BU1 expression in two steps: the loss of H3K4me3 and then subsequent DNA cytosine methylation, changes that were heritable across cell divisions even after the compound was removed. Targeting DNA secondary structures thus represents a potentially new approach for locusspecific epigenetic reprogramming. Delayed resolution of Gquadruplexes during replication can induce localized loss of epigenetic information and changes in gene expression.

In the intestine of Drosophila melanogaster, ageing is correlated with an increase in intestinal stem cell (ISC) proliferation, a block in terminal differentiation of progenitor cells, activation of inflammatory pathways, and increased intestinal permeability2. However, causal relationships between these phenotypes remain unclear. Here, we demonstrate that ageing results in altered localization and expression of septate junction proteins in the posterior midgut, which is quite pronounced in differentiated enterocytes (ECs) at tricellular junctions (TCJs). Acute loss of the TCJ protein Gliotactin (Gli) in ECs results in increased ISC proliferation and a block in differentiation in intestines from young flies, demonstrating that compromised TCJ function is sufficient to alter ISC behaviour in a nonautonomous manner. Blocking the Jun Nterminal kinase signalling pathway is sufficient to suppress changes in ISC behaviour, but has no effect on loss of intestinal barrier function, as a consequence of Gli depletion.

Based on a literature review and expert input, this study first identifies and assesses the major international, European Union, US and UK antibiotic RD funding programmes. These programmes are then evaluated across market and public health criteria necessary for comprehensively improving the antibiotic market. The current set of incentive programmes are an important initial step to improving the economic feasibility of antibiotic development. However, there appears to be a lack of global coordination across all initiatives, which risks duplicating efforts, leaving funding gaps in the value chain and overlooking important AMR goals. This study finds that incentive programmes are overly committed to earlystage push funding of basic science and preclinical research, while there is limited latestage push funding of clinical development. Moreover, there are almost no pull incentives to facilitate transition of antibiotic products from early clinical phases to commercialisation, focus developer concentration on the highest priority antibiotics and attract large pharmaceutical companies to invest in the market.

Specifically, using the prototypical system of gold triangular nanoprisms, we show that colloidal selfassembly is analogous to polymerization in three aspects: ensemble growth statistics following models for stepgrowth polymerization, with nanoparticles as linkable \"monomers\"; bond angles determined by directional internanoparticle interactions; and product topology determined by the valency of monomeric units. Liquidphase transmission electron microscopy imaging and theoretical modeling elucidate the nanometerscale mechanisms for these polymerlike phenomena in nanoparticle systems.

Different types of bipolar cell split the photoreceptor input into parallel channels and provide the excitatory drive for downstream visual circuits. Mouse bipolar cell types have been described at great anatomical and genetic detail, but a similarly deep understanding of their functional diversity is lacking. Here, by imaging lightdriven glutamate release from more than 13,000 bipolar cell axon terminals in the intact retina, we show that bipolar cell functional diversity is generated by the interplay of dendritic excitatory inputs and axonal inhibitory inputs. The resulting centre and surround components of bipolar cell receptive fields interact to decorrelate bipolar cell output in the spatial and temporal domains. Our findings highlight the importance of inhibitory circuits in generating functionally diverse excitatory pathways and suggest that decorrelation of parallel visual pathways begins as early as the second synapse of the mouse visual system. The functional diversity of bipolar cells, which split visual inputs into different excitatory channels within the retina, arises from centresurround interactions in their receptive fields that tune both spatial and temporal signalling. Visual features such as edges or motion are extracted by the retina for transmission to the brain. This is made possible by bipolar cells, which split photoreceptor input into separate channels, owing to their neuroanatomical and molecular diversity. By imaging 13,000 bipolar cells in the mouse retina, Tom Baden and colleagues now describe the excitatory and inhibitory inputs that allow for the vast functional diversity of bipolar cells.

Olefin metathesis reactions are important in synthetic organic chemistry and were recognized with a Nobel Prize in 2005. Controlling which isomer (E or Z) is produced during the reaction can be vital, particularly at late stages in multistep syntheses, or when the product is sensitive to further reactions intended to convert to a single isomer. As Zisomers are thermodynamically favoured, routes to form Eisomers directly are particularly valuable and, when this is applied to ringclosing reactions, the additional challenge of having equimolar amounts of each coupling partner by default means that typical reagentexcess strategies cannot be used. Now, Amir Hoveyda and colleagues report a catalyst system for direct and selective Ealkene formation in ringclosing metathesis reactions, exemplified by the synthesis of pacritinib and recifeiolide in EZ ratios greater than 982. Macrocyclic compounds are central to the development of new drugs, but preparing them can be challenging because of the energy barrier that must be surmounted in order to bring together and fuse the two ends of an acyclic precursor such as an alkene (also known as an olefin)1. To this end, the catalytic process known as ringclosing metathesis (RCM)2,3,4 has allowed access to countless biologically active macrocyclic organic molecules, even for largescale production5. Stereoselectivity is often critical in such cases: the potency of a macrocyclic compound can depend on the stereochemistry of its alkene; alternatively, one isomer of the compound can be subjected to stereoselective modification (such as dihydroxylation6). Kinetically controlled Zselective RCM reactions have been reported7,8,9,10, but the only available metathesis approach for accessing macrocyclic Eolefins entails selective removal of the Zcomponent of a stereoisomeric mixture by ethenolysis10, sacrificing substantial quantities of material if EZ ratios are near unity. Use of ethylene can also cause adventitious olefin isomerizationa particularly serious problem when the Ealkene is energetically less favoured. Here, we show that dienes containing an EalkenylB(pinacolato) group, widely used in catalytic crosscoupling11, possess the requisite electronic and steric attributes to allow them to be converted stereoselectively to Emacrocyclic alkenes. The reaction is promoted by a molybdenum monoaryloxide pyrrolide complex and affords products at a yield of up to 73 per cent and an EZ ratio greater than 982. We highlight the utility of the approach by preparing recifeiolide (a 12memberedring antibiotic)12,13 and pacritinib (an 18memberedring enzyme inhibitor)14,15, the Zisomer of which is less potent than the Eisomer16.

Wu et al. demonstrate that the transcription factor musculin is critical for supporting the differentiation of these cells and prevents their acquisition of a T helper type 2 phenotype. Although master transcription factors (TFs) are key to the development of specific T cell subsets, whether additional transcriptional regulators are induced by the same stimuli that dominantly repress the development of other, nonspecific T cell lineages has not been fully elucidated. Through the use of regulatory T cells (Treg cells) induced by transforming growth factor (TGF), we identified the TF musculin (MSC) as being critical for the development of induced Treg cells (iTreg cells) by repression of the T helper type 2 (TH2) transcriptional program. Loss of MSC reduced expression of the Treg cell master TF Foxp3 and induced TH2 differentiation even under iTregcelldifferentiation conditions.

Bohme et al. find that presynaptic scaffold complexes spatiotemporally control Unc13 isoforms to establish two independent release pathways at subsynaptic active zones: Unc13B defines nascent, loosely coupled synapses whereas Unc13A facilitates release at mature synapses by tight coupling between Ca2 channels and synaptic vesicles. Brain function relies on fast and precisely timed synaptic vesicle (SV) release at active zones (AZs). Efficacy of SV release depends on distance from SV to Ca2 channel, but molecular mechanisms controlling this are unknown. Here we found that distances can be defined by targeting two unc13 (Unc13) isoforms to presynaptic AZ subdomains. Superresolution and intravital imaging of developing Drosophila melanogaster glutamatergic synapses revealed that the Unc13B isoform was recruited to nascent AZs by the scaffolding proteins Syd1 and Liprin, and Unc13A was positioned by Bruchpilot and Rimbinding protein complexes at maturing AZs. Unc13B localized 120 nm away from Ca2 channels, whereas Unc13A localized only 70 nm away and was responsible for docking SVs at this distance. Unc13Anull mutants suffered from inefficient, delayed and EGTAsupersensitive release. Mathematical modeling suggested that synapses normally operate via two independent release pathways differentially positioned by either isoform. We identified isoformspecific Unc13AZ scaffold interactions regulating SVCa2channel topology whose developmental tightening optimizes synaptic transmission.", "authors": "Mathias A Bohme; Christina Beis; Suneel ReddyAlla; Eric Reynolds; Malou M Mampell; Andreas T Grasskamp; Janine Lutzkendorf; Dominique Dufour Bergeron; Jan H Driller; Husam Babikir; Fabian Gottfert; Iain M Robinson; Cahir J O'Kane; Stefan W Hell; Markus C Wahl; Ulrich Stelzl; Bernhard Loll; Alexander M Walter; Stephan J Sigrist", "keywords": "Ion channels in the nervous system; Molecular neuroscience; Synaptic vesicle exocytosis", "organization_affiliated": "Institute for BiologyGenetics, Freie Universitat Berlin, Berlin, Germany; NeuroCure, Cluster of Excellence, Charite Universitatsmedizin, Berlin, Germany; Institute for BiologyGenetics, Freie Universitat Berlin, Berlin, Germany; Institute for BiologyGenetics, Freie Universitat Berlin, Berlin, Germany; Institute for BiologyGenetics, Freie Universitat Berlin, Berlin, Germany; Institute for BiologyGenetics, Freie Universitat Berlin, Berlin, Germany; NeuroCure, Cluster of Excellence, Charite Universitatsmedizin, Berlin, Germany; Molecular and Theoretical Neuroscience, LeibnizInstitut fur Molekulare Pharmakologie, Berlin, Germany; Institute for BiologyGenetics, Freie Universitat Berlin, Berlin, Germany; Institute for BiologyGenetics, Freie Universitat Berlin, Berlin, Germany; Institute of Chemistry and BiochemistyStructural Biochemistry, Freie Universitat Berlin, Berlin, Germany; Institute for BiologyGenetics, Freie Universitat Berlin, Berlin, Germany; Department of Nanobiophotonics, Max Planck Institute for Biophysical Chemistry, Gottingen, Germany; Plymouth University Peninsula School of Medicine, Plymouth University, Plymouth, UK; Department of Genetics, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK; Department of Nanobiophotonics, Max Planck Institute for Biophysical Chemistry, Gottingen, Germany; Institute of Chemistry and BiochemistyStructural Biochemistry, Freie Universitat Berlin, Berlin, Germany; Institute of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Pharmaceutical Chemistry, University of Graz, Graz, Austria; Institute of Chemistry and BiochemistyStructural Biochemistry, Freie Universitat Berlin, Berlin, Germany; Molecular and Theoretical Neuroscience, LeibnizInstitut fur Molekulare Pharmakologie, Berlin, Germany; Institute for BiologyGenetics, Freie Universitat Berlin, Berlin, Germany; NeuroCure, Cluster of Excellence, Charite Universitatsmedizin, Berlin, Germany"}

A genetic predisposition to RA, such as HLADR4 positivity, indicates that dendritic cells (DC) are of crucial importance to pathogenesis by activating autoreactive lymphocytes. Here we show that microRNA34a provides homoeostatic control of CD1c DC activation via regulation of tyrosine kinase receptor AXL, an important inhibitory DC autoregulator. This pathway is aberrant in CD1c DCs from patients with RA, with upregulation of miR34a and lower levels of AXL compared to DC from healthy donors. Production of proinflammatory cytokines is reduced by ex vivo genesilencing of miR34a. miR34adeficient mice are resistant to collageninduced arthritis and interaction of DCs and T cells from these mice are reduced and do not support the development of Th17 cells in vivo. Our findings therefore show that miR34a is an epigenetic regulator of DC function that may contribute to RA. Axl is a TAM receptor that can inhibit Tolllike receptor (TLR) induced proinflammatory production by dendritic cells (DC).

The dominantly inherited spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs) are a large and diverse group of neurodegenerative diseases.

NFB is a key mediator of the inflammatory response, and its dysregulation has been associated with immunerelated malignancies.

Elevated miR155 expression potentiates NFB activity in miR146adeficient mice, leading to both an overactive acute inflammatory response and chronic inflammation. Enforced miR155 expression overrides miR146amediated repression of NFB activation, thus emphasizing the dominant function of miR155 in promoting inflammation. Moreover, miR155deficient macrophages exhibit a suboptimal inflammatory response when exposed to low levels of inflammatory stimuli. Importantly, we demonstrate a temporal asymmetry between miR155 and miR146a expression during macrophage activation, which creates a combined positive and negative feedback network controlling NFB activity. This miRNAbased regulatory network enables a robust yet timelimited inflammatory response essential for functional immunity. MicroRNAs (miR) are important regulators of gene transcription, with miR155 and miR146a both implicated in macrophage activation.

Here in a human cell line, we map genomewide and at high resolution the DSBs induced by a restriction enzyme, and we characterize their impact on gene expression by four independent approaches by monitoring steadystate RNA levels, rates of RNA synthesis, transcription initiation and RNA polymerase II elongation. We consistently observe transcriptional repression in proximity to DSBs. Downregulation of transcription depends on ATM kinase activity and on the distance from the DSB.

Rapid DNA expression in millions of cells per minute can be achieved with a microfluidic device that integrates mechanical squeezing of the cells and electricfieldmediated transient disruption of the plasma and nuclear membranes.", "authors": "Xiaoyun Ding; Martin P.

Here we demonstrate that, compared with normal hepatocytes, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells markedly reduce the rate of fructose metabolism and the level of reactive oxygen species, as a result of a cMycdependent and heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP) H1 and H2mediated switch from expression of the highactivity fructokinase (KHK)C to the lowactivity KHKA isoform. Importantly, KHKA acts as a protein kinase, phosphorylating and activating phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate synthetase 1 (PRPS1) to promote pentose phosphate pathwaydependent de novo nucleic acid synthesis and HCC formation. Furthermore, cMyc, hnRNPH12 and KHKA expression levels and PRPS1 Thr225 phosphorylation levels correlate with each other in HCC specimens and are associated with poor prognosis for HCC. These findings reveal a pivotal mechanism underlying the distinct fructose metabolism between HCC cells and normal hepatocytes and highlight the instrumental role of KHKA protein kinase activity in promoting de novo nucleic acid synthesis and HCC development.

This spinorbit torque (SOT) has been widely used to manipulate the magnetization in metallic ferromagnets. In the case of magnetic insulators (MIs), although charge currents cannot flow, spin currents can propagate, but currentinduced control of the magnetization in a MI has so far remained elusive. Here we demonstrate spincurrentinduced switching of a perpendicularly magnetized thulium iron garnet film driven by charge current in a Pt overlayer. We estimate a relatively large spinmixing conductance and dampinglike SOT through spin Hall magnetoresistance and harmonic Hall measurements, respectively, indicating considerable spin transparency at the PtMI interface. We show that spin currents injected across this interface lead to deterministic magnetization reversal at low current densities, paving the road towards ultralowdissipation spintronic devices based on MIs.

We evaluated the materials in vivo and identified three triazolecontaining analogs that substantially reduce foreign body reactions in both rodents and, for at least 6 months, in nonhuman primates.

Although the age of symptomatic onset is usually during childhood or adolescence, symptoms can sometimes develop much later. Although the aetiology of T1DM is not completely understood, the pathogenesis of the disease is thought to involve T cellmediated destruction of cells. Islettargeting autoantibodies that target insulin, 65 kDa glutamic acid decarboxylase, insulinomaassociated protein 2 and zinc transporter 8  all of which are proteins associated with secretory granules in cells  are biomarkers of T1DMassociated autoimmunity that are found months to years before symptom onset, and can be used to identify and study individuals who are at risk of developing T1DM. The type of autoantibody that appears first depends on the environmental trigger and on genetic factors. The pathogenesis of T1DM can be divided into three stages depending on the absence or presence of hyperglycaemia and hyperglycaemiaassociated symptoms (such as polyuria and thirst). A cure is not available, and patients depend on lifelong insulin injections; novel approaches to insulin treatment, such as insulin pumps, continuous glucose monitoring and hybrid closedloop systems, are in development. Although intensive glycaemic control has reduced the incidence of microvascular and macrovascular complications, the majority of patients with T1DM are still developing these complications. Major research efforts are needed to achieve early diagnosis, prevent cell loss and develop better treatment options to improve the quality of life and prognosis of those affected.

Carlier and Shekhar propose that a global treadmilling process  whereby the various actin networks grow and shrink depending on the local activity of actin regulators  establishes a steadystate concentration of actin monomers that supports this homeostatic actin turnover. Various cellular processes (including cell motility) are driven by the regulated, polarized assembly of actin filaments into distinct forceproducing arrays of defined size and architecture. Branched, linear, contractile and cytosolic arrays coexist in vivo, and cells intricately control the number, length and assembly rate of filaments in these arrays. Recent in vitro and in vivo studies have revealed novel molecular mechanisms that regulate the number of filament barbed and pointed ends and their respective assembly and disassembly rates, thus defining classes of dynamically different filaments, which coexist in the same cell. We propose that a global treadmilling process, in which a steadystate amount of polymerizable actin monomers is established by the dynamics of each network, is responsible for defining the size and turnover of coexisting actin networks. Furthermore, signalinduced changes in the partitioning of actin to distinct arrays (mediated by RHO GTPases) result in the establishment of various steadystate concentrations of polymerizable monomers, thereby globally influencing the growth rate of actin filaments.", "authors": "MarieFrance Carlier; Shashank Shekhar", "keywords": "Actin; Filopodia; Lamellipodia", "organization_affiliated": "MarieFrance Carlier and Shashank Shekhar are at Institute for Integrative Biology of the Cell (I2BC), CNRS, GifsurYvette, Paris 91190, France., \n                  ; MarieFrance Carlier and Shashank Shekhar are at Institute for Integrative Biology of the Cell (I2BC), CNRS, GifsurYvette, Paris 91190, France., \n                  "}

It was shown recently that immune dysfunction can influence spatial learning and memory. Jonathan Kipnis and colleagues now show that mice deficient in adaptive immunity exhibit defects in social behaviour. They find that interferon controls neural circuits and social behaviour by signalling neurons to tune GABAergic signalling in the prefrontal cortex. This work suggests that interferon signalling may provide a coevolutionary link between social behaviour and an antipathogen immune response. Immune dysfunction is commonly associated with several neurological and mental disorders. Although the mechanisms by which peripheral immunity may influence neuronal function are largely unknown, recent findings implicate meningeal immunity influencing behaviour, such as spatial learning and memory1. Here we show that meningeal immunity is also critical for social behaviour; mice deficient in adaptive immunity exhibit social deficits and hyperconnectivity of frontocortical brain regions. Associations between rodent transcriptomes from brain and cellular transcriptomes in response to Tcellderived cytokines suggest a strong interaction between social behaviour and interferon (IFN)driven responses. Concordantly, we demonstrate that inhibitory neurons respond to IFN and increase GABAergic (aminobutyricacid) currents in projection neurons, suggesting that IFN is a molecular link between meningeal immunity and neural circuits recruited for social behaviour. Metaanalysis of the transcriptomes of a range of organisms reveals that rodents, fish, and flies elevate IFNJAKSTATdependent gene signatures in a social context, suggesting that the IFN signalling pathway could mediate a coevolutionary link between socialaggregation behaviour and an efficient antipathogen response.

Using a novel database of 45,813 first records of 16,926 established alien species, we show that the annual rate of first records worldwide has increased during the last 200 years, with 37% of all first records reported most recently (19702014). Intercontinental and intertaxonomic variation can be largely attributed to the diaspora of European settlers in the nineteenth century and to the acceleration in trade in the twentieth century. For all taxonomic groups, the increase in numbers of alien species does not show any sign of saturation and most taxa even show increases in the rate of first records over time. This highlights that past efforts to mitigate invasions have not been effective enough to keep up with increasing globalization. Alien species of animals and plants can invade new regions of the earth.

{"id": "ac1043a5c4dd446a89cd4ab18f99961c", "title": "A basal ganglia circuit for evaluating action outcomes", "abstract": "In mice, glutamatergic globus pallidus neurons projecting to the lateral habenula (GPh neurons) bidirectionally encode positive and negative prediction error signals that are critical for outcome evaluation and are driven by a subset of basal ganglia circuits. The basal ganglia play a crucial role in action selection, but their involvement in evaluating the outcome of actions is less well understood. Bo Li and colleagues show that in mice, glutamatergic globus pallidus neurons projecting to the lateral habenula (GPh neurons) evaluate positive and negative action outcomes, thereby biasing subsequent actions, and this requires inhibitory and excitatory inputs to the GPh, respectively. Identifying the origin of these inputs in the striatum and the subthalamic nucleus, the authors propose that information about the selection and evaluation of actions is channelled through distinct, though intermingled, basal ganglia circuits. The basal ganglia, a group of subcortical nuclei, play a crucial role in decisionmaking by selecting actions and evaluating their outcomes1,2. While much is known about the function of the basal ganglia circuitry in selection1,3,4, how these nuclei contribute to outcome evaluation is less clear. Here we show that neurons in the habenulaprojecting globus pallidus (GPh) in mice are essential for evaluating action outcomes and are regulated by a specific set of inputs from the basal ganglia. We find in a classical conditioning task that individual mouse GPh neurons bidirectionally encode whether an outcome is better or worse than expected. Mimicking these evaluation signals with optogenetic inhibition or excitation is sufficient to reinforce or discourage actions in a decisionmaking task. Moreover, celltypespecific synaptic manipulations reveal that the inhibitory and excitatory inputs to the GPh are necessary for mice to appropriately evaluate positive and negative feedback, respectively. Finally, using rabiesvirusassisted monosynaptic tracing5, we show that the GPh is embedded in a basal ganglia circuit wherein it receives inhibitory input from both striosomal and matrix compartments of the striatum, and excitatory input from the 'limbic' regions of the subthalamic nucleus. Our results provide evidence that information about the selection and evaluation of actions is channelled through distinct sets of basal ganglia circuits, with the GPh representing a key locus in which information of opposing valence is integrated to determine whether action outcomes are better or worse than expected.", "authors": "Marcus StephensonJones; Kai Yu; Sandra Ahrens; Jason M.

Here, we solve the structure of hRpn13 with a segment of hRpn2 that serves as its proteasome docking site; a prolinerich Cterminal hRpn2 extension stretches across a narrow canyon of the ubiquitinbinding hRpn13 Pru domain blocking an RA190binding surface. Biophysical analyses in combination with cellbased assays indicate that hRpn13 binds preferentially to hRpn2 and proteasomes over RA190. hRpn13 also exists outside of proteasomes where it may be RA190 sensitive. RA190 does not affect hRpn13 interaction with Uch37, but rather directly binds and inactivates Uch37. hRpn13 deletion from HCT116 cells abrogates RA190induced accumulation of substrates at proteasomes. We propose that RA190 targets hRpn13 and Uch37 through parallel mechanisms and at proteasomes, RA190inactivated Uch37 cannot disassemble hRpn13bound ubiquitin chains. In the proteasome, Rpn2 provides the docking site for substrate receptor Rpn13.

This study demonstrated nondestructive readout of digital data stored using specific domainwall configurations in epitaxial BiFeO3 thin films formed in mesageometry structures. Partially switched domains, which enable the formation of conductive walls during the read operation, spontaneously retract when the read voltage is removed, reducing the accumulation of mobile defects at the domain walls and potentially improving the device stability. Threeterminal memory devices produced 14 nA read currents at an operating voltage of 5 V, and operated up to T  85 C. The gap length can also be smaller than the film thickness, allowing the realization of ferroelectric memories with device dimensions far below 100 nm. An inplane memory device based on multidomain BiFeO3 thin films is reported. Highly conductive domain walls appear only during the application of a readout field, a nondestructive process that reduces accumulation of mobile defects on the walls.", "authors": "Jun Jiang; Zi Long Bai; Zhi Hui Chen; Long He; David Wei Zhang; Qing Hua Zhang; Jin An Shi; Min Hyuk Park; James F.

Here, Nick Ward discusses the reasons behind this lack of benefit, and the prospects for understanding poststroke plasticity in humans, with a focus on the development of biomarkers that can reconcile preclinical and human studies. Stroke is the leading cause of complex adult disability in the world. Recovery from stroke is often incomplete, which leaves many people dependent on others for their care. The improvement of longterm outcomes should, therefore, be a clinical and research priority. As a result of advances in our understanding of the biological mechanisms involved in recovery and repair after stroke, therapeutic opportunities to promote recovery through manipulation of poststroke plasticity have never been greater. This work has almost exclusively been carried out in preclinical animal models of stroke with little translation into human studies. The challenge ahead is to develop a mechanistic understanding of recovery from stroke in humans. Advances in neuroimaging techniques now enable us to reconcile behavioural accounts of recovery with molecular and cellular changes. Consequently, clinical trials can be designed in a stratified manner that takes into account when an intervention should be delivered and who is most likely to benefit. This approach is expected to lead to a substantial change in how restorative therapeutic strategies are delivered in patients after stroke.", "authors": "Nick S.

However, the mechanism that drives the magnetisation switching in ferromagnets is unclear. Recent theories suggest that the interaction of the light with the magnetised media induces an optomagnetic field within the media, known as the inverse Faraday effect. Here we show that an alternative mechanism, driven by thermal excitation over the anisotropy energy barrier and a difference in the energy absorption depending on polarisation, can create a net magnetisation over a series of laser pulses in an ensemble of single domain grains. Only a small difference in the absorption is required to reach magnetisation levels observed experimentally and the model does not preclude the role of the inverse Faraday effect but removes the necessity that the optomagnetic field is 10 s of Tesla in strength.", "authors": "Matthew O.

However, the efficiency of PP generation in vitro is highly variable, negatively impacting reproducibility and validation of in vitro and in vivo studies, and consequently, translation to the clinic. Here, we report the use of a proteomics approach to phenotypically characterize hPSCderived PPs and distinguish these cells from nonPP populations during differentiation. Our analysis identifies the pancreatic secretory granule membrane major glycoprotein 2 (GP2) as a PPspecific cell surface marker. Remarkably, GP2 is coexpressed with NKX61 and PTF1A in human developing pancreata, indicating that it marks the multipotent pancreatic progenitors in vivo. Finally, we show that isolated hPSCderived GP2 cells generate like cells (CPEPTIDENKX61) more efficiently compared to GP2 and unsorted populations, underlining the potential therapeutic applications of GP2. Pancreatic progenitors (PPs) can be derived from human pluripotent stem cells in vitro but efficiency of differentiation varies, making it hard to sort for insulinproducing cells.

Moreover, we report an itchinducing molecule, cyclic phosphatidic acid, that activates TRPV1 and whose pruritic activity, as well as that of histamine, occurs through the activation of this ion channel. These findings provide insights into the molecular basis of oleic acid inhibition of TRPV1 and also into a way of reducing the pathophysiological effects resulting from its activation. TRPV1 channels are known to mediate pathological pain and itch. Here, the authors find a naturally occurring fatty acid, oleic acid, acts as a TRPV1 antagonist and can modulate capsaicin and histaminemediated pain and itch response in mouse models.\n                  \n                    \n                  \n                ", "authors": "Sara L.

A series of membranes containing different concentrations (0.2, 0.5 and 1.0 wt.%) of GO were fabricated via the phase inversion method, using Nmethyl pyrrolidone (NMP) as the solvent, deionized water as the nonsolvent, and polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) as a pore forming agent. The prepared nanocomposite membranes were characterized using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM), and were also characterized with respect to contact angle, zeta potential and porosity, mean pore radius, tortuosity and molecular weight cutoff (MWCO). Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and tensile testing were used to measure thermal and mechanical properties. The membrane performance was evaluated by volumetric flux and rejection of proteins, and antifouling properties. According to the results, the optimum addition of 0.5 wt% GO resulted in a membrane with an increased flux of 171  3 Lm2h1 with a MWCO of ~40 kDa. In addition, the GO incorporation efficiently inhibited the interaction between proteins and the membrane surface, thereby improving the fouling resistance ability by approximately 58  3%.

In this review, the authors describe the mechanisms of oxidativestressinduced male factor infertility, and how lifestylerelated interventions might reduce levels of seminal oxidative stress, ameliorate infertility and potentially improve the health of the children of men with high levels of seminal oxidative stress. DNA damage, largely owing to oxidative stress, is a leading cause of defective sperm function. High levels of oxidative stress result in damage to sperm DNA, RNA transcripts, and telomeres and, therefore might provide a common underlying aetiology of male infertility and recurrent pregnancy loss, in addition to congenital malformations, complex neuropsychiatric disorders, and childhood cancers in children fathered by men with defective sperm cells. Spermatozoa are highly vulnerable to oxidative stress owing to limited levels of antioxidant defence and a single, limited DNAdamage detection and repair mechanism. Oxidative stress is predominantly caused by a host of lifestylerelated factors, the majority of which are modifiable. Antioxidant regimens and lifestyle modifications could both be plausible therapeutic approaches that enable the burden of oxidativestressinduced male factor infertility to be overcome. Lifestyle interventions including yoga and meditation can substantially improve the integrity of sperm DNA by reducing levels of oxidative DNA damage, regulating oxidative stress and by increasing the expression of genes responsible for DNA repair, cellcycle control and antiinflammatory effects. Oxidative stress is caused by various modifiable factors, and the use of simple interventions can decrease levels of oxidative stress, and therefore reduce the incidence of both infertility and complex diseases in the resultant offspring.", "authors": "Shilpa Bisht; Muneeb Faiq; Madhuri Tolahunase; Rima Dada", "keywords": "DNA damage and repair; Lifestyle modification; Male factor infertility; Stress signalling", "organization_affiliated": "Department of Anatomy, Laboratory for Molecular Reproduction and Genetics, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, India; Department of Anatomy, Laboratory for Molecular Reproduction and Genetics, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, India; Department of Anatomy, Laboratory for Molecular Reproduction and Genetics, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, India; Department of Anatomy, Laboratory for Molecular Reproduction and Genetics, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, India"}

Recently, we reported that it could inhibit the growth of intestinal polyp in animals and in patients with the familial adenomatous polyposis by downregulating catenin signaling. However, the intracellular target mediating the effects of berberine remains elusive. Here, we provide evidence that berberine inhibits catenin function via directly binding to a unique region comprising residues Gln275, Arg316 and Arg371 in nuclear receptor retinoid X receptor alpha (RXR), where berberine concomitantly binding to and synergistically activating RXR with 9cisretinoic acid (9cisRA), a natural ligand binding to the classical ligandbinding pocket of RXR. Berberine binding promotes RXR interaction with nuclear catenin, leading to cCbl mediated degradation of catenin, and consequently inhibits the proliferation of colon cancer cells. Furthermore, berberine suppresses the growth of human colon carcinoma xenograft in nude mice in an RXRdependent manner.

Emerging evidence points to a strong association between the gut microbiota and the risk, development and progression of gastrointestinal cancers such as colorectal cancer (CRC) and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Bile acids, produced in the liver, are metabolized by enzymes derived from intestinal bacteria and are critically important for maintaining a healthy gut microbiota, balanced lipid and carbohydrate metabolism, insulin sensitivity and innate immunity. Given the complexity of bile acid signalling and the direct biochemical interactions between the gut microbiota and the host, a systems biology perspective is required to understand the liverbile acidmicrobiota axis and its role in gastrointestinal carcinogenesis to reverse the microbiotamediated alterations in bile acid metabolism that occur in disease states. An examination of recent research progress in this area is urgently needed. In this Review, we discuss the mechanistic links between bile acids and gastrointestinal carcinogenesis in CRC and HCC, which involve two major bile acidsensing receptors, farnesoid X receptor (FXR) and G proteincoupled bile acid receptor 1 (TGR5).

An H. pylori constituent that augments cancer risk is the strainspecific cag pathogenicity island, which encodes a type IV secretion system (T4SS) that translocates a proinflammatory and oncogenic protein, CagA, into epithelial cells. However, the majority of persons colonized with CagA H. pylori strains do not develop cancer, suggesting that other microbial effectors also have a role in carcinogenesis. Tolllike receptor 9 (TLR9) is an endosome bound, innate immune receptor that detects and responds to hypomethylated CpG DNA motifs that are most commonly found in microbial genomes. Highexpression tlr9 polymorphisms have been linked to the development of premalignant lesions in the stomach. We now demonstrate that levels of H. pylorimediated TLR9 activation and expression are directly related to gastric cancer risk in human populations. Mechanistically, we show for the first time that the H. pylori cancerassociated cag T4SS is required for TLR9 activation and that H. pylori DNA is actively translocated by the cag T4SS to engage this host receptor. Activation of TLR9 occurs through a contactdependent mechanism between pathogen and host, and involves transfer of microbial DNA that is both protected as well as exposed during transport. These results indicate that TLR9 activation via the cag island may modify the risk for malignancy within the context of H. pylori infection and provide an important framework for future studies investigating the microbialepithelial interface in gastric carcinogenesis.", "authors": "M G Varga; C L Shaffer; J C Sierra; G Suarez; M B Piazuelo; M E Whitaker; J RomeroGallo; U S Krishna; A Delgado; M A Gomez; J A D Good; F Almqvist; E P Skaar; P Correa; K T Wilson; M Hadjifrangiskou; R M Peek", "keywords": "Gastric cancer; Microbiology", "organization_affiliated": "Department of Cancer Biology, Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, Nashville, USA; Department of Pathology, Microbiology, and Immunology, Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, Nashville, USA; Division of Gastroenterology, Department of Medicine, Hepatology and Nutrition, Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, Nashville, USA; Division of Gastroenterology, Department of Medicine, Hepatology and Nutrition, Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, Nashville, USA; Division of Gastroenterology, Department of Medicine, Hepatology and Nutrition, Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, Nashville, USA; Division of Gastroenterology, Department of Medicine, Hepatology and Nutrition, Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, Nashville, USA; Division of Gastroenterology, Department of Medicine, Hepatology and Nutrition, Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, Nashville, USA; Division of Gastroenterology, Department of Medicine, Hepatology and Nutrition, Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, Nashville, USA; Division of Gastroenterology, Department of Medicine, Hepatology and Nutrition, Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, Nashville, USA; Department of Internal Medicine, Unit of Gastroenterology, National University of Colombia School of Medicine, Bogota, Colombia; Department of Chemistry, Umea University, Umea, Sweden; Umea Centre for Microbial Research, Umea University, Umea, Sweden; Department of Chemistry, Umea University, Umea, Sweden; Umea Centre for Microbial Research, Umea University, Umea, Sweden; Department of Pathology, Microbiology, and Immunology, Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, Nashville, USA; Veterans Affairs Tennessee Valley Healthcare System, Nashville, USA; Division of Gastroenterology, Department of Medicine, Hepatology and Nutrition, Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, Nashville, USA; Department of Cancer Biology, Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, Nashville, USA; Department of Pathology, Microbiology, and Immunology, Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, Nashville, USA; Division of Gastroenterology, Department of Medicine, Hepatology and Nutrition, Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, Nashville, USA; Veterans Affairs Tennessee Valley Healthcare System, Nashville, USA; Department of Pathology, Microbiology, and Immunology, Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, Nashville, USA; Department of Cancer Biology, Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, Nashville, USA; Department of Pathology, Microbiology, and Immunology, Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, Nashville, USA; Division of Gastroenterology, Department of Medicine, Hepatology and Nutrition, Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, Nashville, USA"}

Through the use of a transgenic mouse that expresses CD1a, Winau and colleagues demonstrate that Langerhans cells use CD1a to present contact allergens and self lipid antigens and thereby worsen inflammatory skin conditions. CD1a is a lipidpresenting molecule that is abundantly expressed on Langerhans cells. However, the in vivo role of CD1a has remained unclear, principally because CD1a is lacking in mice. Through the use of mice with transgenic expression of CD1a, we found that the plantderived lipid urushiol triggered CD1adependent skin inflammation driven by CD4 helper T cells that produced the cytokines IL17 and IL22 (TH17 cells). Human subjects with poisonivy dermatitis had a similar cytokine signature following CD1amediated recognition of urushiol. Among various urushiol congeners, we identified diunsaturated pentadecylcatechol (C15:2) as the dominant antigen for CD1arestricted T cells. We determined the crystal structure of the CD1aurushiol (C15:2) complex, demonstrating the molecular basis of urushiol interaction with the antigenbinding cleft of CD1a. In a mouse model and in patients with psoriasis, CD1a amplified inflammatory responses that were mediated by TH17 cells that reacted to self lipid antigens.

Maternal serum metabolomics analysis, along with satiety hormone and gut microbiota analysis, identified maternal metabolic signatures that could be implicated in programming offspring obesity risk and highlighted the potential influence of maternal gut microbiota on maternal and offspring metabolism. In particular, the metabolomic signature of insulin resistance in obese rats normalized when dams consumed the prebiotic. In summary, prebiotic intake during pregnancy and lactation improves maternal metabolism in dietinduced obese rats in a manner that attenuates the detrimental nutritional programming of offspring associated with maternal obesity.

Zhang and colleagues show that the E3 ligase TRIM29 suppresses excessive proinflammatory responses by targeting the adaptor NEMO in alveolar macrophages. The respiratory tract is heavily populated with innate immune cells, but the mechanisms that control such cells are poorly defined. Here we found that the E3 ubiquitin ligase TRIM29 was a selective regulator of the activation of alveolar macrophages, the expression of type I interferons and the production of proinflammatory cytokines in the lungs. We found that deletion of TRIM29 enhanced macrophage production of type I interferons and protected mice from infection with influenza virus, while challenge of Trim29 mice with Haemophilus influenzae resulted in lethal lung inflammation due to massive production of proinflammatory cytokines by macrophages. Mechanistically, we demonstrated that TRIM29 inhibited interferonregulatory factors and signaling via the transcription factor NFB by degrading the adaptor NEMO and that TRIM29 directly bound NEMO and subsequently induced its ubiquitination and proteolytic degradation.

Here we present a molecular level understanding of the initial target membrane interaction for two cationic helical AMPs that share structural similarities but have a tenfold difference in antibacterial potency towards Gramnegative bacteria. The binding and insertion from solution of pleurocidin or magainin 2 to membranes representing the inner membrane of Gramnegative bacteria, comprising a mixture of 128 anionic and 384 zwitterionic lipids, is monitored over 100 ns in all atom molecular dynamics simulations. The effects of the membrane interaction on both the peptide and lipid constituents are considered and compared with new and published experimental data obtained in the steady state. While both magainin 2 and pleurocidin are capable of disrupting bacterial membranes, the greater potency of pleurocidin is linked to its ability to penetrate within the bacterial cell. We show that pleurocidin displays much greater conformational flexibility when compared with magainin 2, resists selfassociation at the membrane surface and penetrates further into the hydrophobic core of the lipid bilayer. Conformational flexibility is therefore revealed as a key feature required of apparently helical cationic AMPs for enhanced antibacterial potency.", "authors": "SarahBeth T. A. Amos; Louic S.

Although there are many geochemical records of past climate variability, an extensive reconstruction of global average surface temperature (GAST) has so far been lacking. Carolyn Snyder has used a network of sea surface temperature reconstructions to reconstruct the GAST for the past 2 million years. The results show continuous cooling until about 1.2 million years ago, followed by a general flattening of the GAST profile, with close coupling of global temperature and atmospheric greenhouse gases over the past 800,000 years. The reconstruction, combined with records of atmospheric CO2, suggest a future warming of 37 degrees Celsius, even if atmospheric CO2 concentrations stabilize at presentday levels. Reconstructions of Earth's past climate strongly influence our understanding of the dynamics and sensitivity of the climate system. Yet global temperature has been reconstructed for only a few isolated windows of time1,2, and continuous reconstructions across glacial cycles remain elusive. Here I present a spatially weighted proxy reconstruction of global temperature over the past 2 million years estimated from a multiproxy database of over 20,000 sea surface temperature point reconstructions. Global temperature gradually cooled until roughly 1.2 million years ago and cooling then stalled until the present. The cooling trend probably stalled before the beginning of the midPleistocene transition3, and predated the increase in the maximum size of ice sheets around 0.9 million years ago4,5,6. Thus, global cooling may have been a precondition for, but probably is not the sole causal mechanism of, the shift to quasi100,000year glacial cycles at the midPleistocene transition. Over the past 800,000 years, polar amplification (the amplification of temperature change at the poles relative to global temperature change) has been stable over time, and global temperature and atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations have been closely coupled across glacial cycles. A comparison of the new temperature reconstruction with radiative forcing from greenhouse gases estimates an Earth system sensitivity of 9 degrees Celsius (range 7 to 13 degrees Celsius, 95 per cent credible interval) change in global average surface temperature per doubling of atmospheric carbon dioxide over millennium timescales. This result suggests that stabilization at today's greenhouse gas levels may already commit Earth to an eventual total warming of 5 degrees Celsius (range 3 to 7 degrees Celsius, 95 per cent credible interval) over the next few millennia as ice sheets, vegetation and atmospheric dust continue to respond to global warming.", "authors": "Carolyn W.

Flexoelectricity, the phenomenon in which a strain gradient induces spontaneous electrical polarization, could be enormously useful if the effect weren't usually so minuscule. Until now, flexoelectricity has been investigated mainly as a property of dielectrics. Here Gustau Catalan and colleagues demonstrate the existence of effects similar to flexoelectricity in semiconductors, an environment in which the effect might be greatly enhanced. The authors reasoned that if the interfacial layers of a material are considered very thin capacitors, then the effective polarizability of this capacitor structure can be amplified if the charges are able to move freely. By applying this concept to barium titanate doped with oxygen vacancies to increase conductivity, they show that the effective flexoelectricity is enhanced by several orders of magnitude. This method of enhancing the flexoelectric response could be of practical use, for instance in flexoelectricitybased sensors. Flexoelectricity is a property of all dielectric materials whereby they polarize in response to deformation gradients such as those produced by bending1,2,3,4,5. Although it is generally thought of as a property of dielectric insulators, insulation is not a formal requirement: in principle, semiconductors can also redistribute their free charge in response to strain gradients. Here we show that bending a semiconductor not only generates a flexoelectriclike response, but that this response can in fact be much larger than in insulators. By doping single crystals of widebandgap oxides to increase their conductivity, their effective flexoelectric coefficient was increased by orders of magnitude. This large response can be explained by a barrierlayer mechanism that remains important even at the macroscale, where conventional (insulator) flexoelectricity otherwise tends to be small.

We here report on thinfilm deposition of the thermally and chemically stable UiO66 in an allgasphase process by the aid of atomic layer deposition (ALD). Sequential reactions of ZrCl4 and 1,4benzenedicarboxylic acid produce amorphous organicinorganic hybrid films that are subsequently crystallized to the UiO66 structure by treatment in acetic acid vapour.

An allgasphase synthesis technique for UiO66 could enable implementations in microelectronics that are not compatible with solvothermal synthesis.

Managed honeybees are particularly used within massflowering crops and often spill over to adjacent natural habitats after crop blooming. Here, we uniquely show the simultaneous impact that honeybee spillover has on wild plant and animal communities in flowerrich woodlands via changes in plantpollinator network structure that translate into a direct negative effect on the reproductive success of a dominant wild plant. Honeybee spillover leads to a reassembly of plantpollinator interactions through increased competition with other pollinator species. Moreover, honeybee preference for the most abundant plant species reduces its seed set, driven by high honeybee visitation rates that prevent pollen tube growth. Our study therefore calls for an adequate understanding of the tradeoffs between providing pollination services to crops and the effects that managed pollinators might have on wild plants and pollinators. Honeybees are used for crop pollination but also spill over into nearby natural habitats.

Within this context, quantum dots possess welldefined spin states (matter qubits), which couple efficiently to photons. By embedding them in nanophotonic waveguides, they provide a promising platform for quantum technology implementations. In this paper, we demonstrate that the naturally occurring electromagnetic field chirality that arises in nanobeam waveguides leads to unidirectional photon emission from quantum dot spin states, with resultant inplane transfer of matterqubit information. The chiral behaviour occurs despite the nonchiral geometry and material of the waveguides. Using dot registration techniques, we achieve a quantum emitter deterministically positioned at a chiral point and realize spinpath conversion by design. We further show that the chiral phenomena are much more tolerant to dot position than in standard photonic crystal waveguides, exhibit spinpath readout up to 955% and have potential to serve as the basis of spinlogic and network implementations. Scalable quantum technologies require efficient conversion between qubits stored in solidstate systems and flying photonic qubits.

However, few are effective because cancer cells develop ways to resist and evade treatment. Here, we introduce a photoactivable multiinhibitor nanoliposome (PMIL) that imparts lightinduced cytotoxicity in synchrony with a photoinitiated and sustained release of inhibitors that suppress tumour regrowth and treatment escape signalling pathways. The PMIL consists of a nanoliposome doped with a photoactivable chromophore (benzoporphyrin derivative, BPD) in the lipid bilayer, and a nanoparticle containing cabozantinib (XL184)a multikinase inhibitorencapsulated inside. Nearinfrared tumour irradiation, following intravenous PMIL administration, triggers photodynamic damage of tumour cells and microvessels, and simultaneously initiates release of XL184 inside the tumour. A single PMIL treatment achieves prolonged tumour reduction in two mouse models and suppresses metastatic escape in an orthotopic pancreatic tumour model. The PMIL offers new prospects for cancer therapy by enabling spatiotemporal control of drug release while reducing systemic drug exposure and associated toxicities. A photoactivatable nanoliposome carrying multikinase inhibitors tackles tumours by killing cancer cells through photodynamic therapy and simultaneously shutting down signalling pathways that allow cancerous cells to metastasize and escape treatment, offering a way to maximize the therapeutic efficacy of each treatment cycle.", "authors": "Bryan Q.

Using wholeexome and deeptargeted sequencing, we dissect evolution of ibrutinib resistance in serial samples from five chronic lymphocytic leukaemia patients. In two patients, we detect BTKC481S mutation or multiple PLCG2 mutations. The other three patients exhibit an expansion of clones harbouring del(8p) with additional driver mutations (EP300, MLL2 and EIF2A), with one patient developing transdifferentiation into CD19negative histiocytic sarcoma. Using dropletmicrofluidic technology and growth kinetic analyses, we demonstrate the presence of ibrutinibresistant subclones and estimate subclone size before treatment initiation. Haploinsufficiency of TRAILR, a consequence of del(8p), results in TRAIL insensitivity, which may contribute to ibrutinib resistance. These findings demonstrate that the ibrutinib therapy favours selection and expansion of rare subclones already present before ibrutinib treatment, and provide insight into the heterogeneity of genetic changes associated with ibrutinib resistance. The BTK inhibitor ibrutinib is used to treat chronic lymphocytic leukaemia, however some patients develop resistance to the drug.

National space agencies and private corporations aim at an extended presence of humans in space in the medium to long term. Together with currently suboptimal technology, microgravity and cosmic rays raise health concerns about deepspace exploration missions. Both of these physical factors affect the cardiovascular system, whose gravitydependence is pronounced. Heart and vascular function are, therefore, susceptible to substantial changes in weightlessness. The altered cardiovascular function in space causes physiological problems in the postflight period. A compromised cardiovascular system can be excessively vulnerable to space radiation, synergistically resulting in increased damage. The space radiation dose is significantly lower than in patients undergoing radiotherapy, in whom cardiac damage is welldocumented following cancer therapy in the thoracic region. Nevertheless, epidemiological findings suggest an increased risk of late cardiovascular disease even with low doses of radiation. Moreover, the peculiar biological effectiveness of heavy ions in cosmic rays might increase this risk substantially. However, whether radiationinduced cardiovascular effects have a threshold at low doses is still unclear. The main countermeasures to mitigate the effect of the space environment on cardiac function are physical exercise, antioxidants, nutraceuticals, and radiation shielding.", "authors": "Richard L.

Therefore, many metallic materials are being used in polycrystalline form, even though material properties are superior in a single crystal. Here we show that an extraordinarily large CuAlMn single crystal can be obtained by abnormal grain growth (AGG) induced by simple heat treatment with high mass productivity. In AGG, the subboundary energy introduced by cyclic heat treatment (CHT) is dominant in the driving pressure, and the grain boundary migration rate is accelerated by repeating the lowtemperature CHT due to the increase of the subboundary energy. With such treatment, fabrication of single crystal bars 70 cm in length is achieved. This result ensures that the range of applications of shape memory alloys will spread beyond smallsized devices to largescale components and may enable new applications of single crystals in other metallic and ceramics materials having similar microstructural features.

Osteoporosis develops when the rate of osteoclastic bone breakdown (resorption) exceeds that of osteoblastic bone formation, which leads to loss of BMD and deterioration of bone structure and strength. Osteoporosis increases the risk of fragility fractures, a cause of substantial morbidity and mortality, especially in elderly patients. This imbalance between bone formation and bone resorption is brought about by natural ageing processes, but is frequently exacerbated by a number of pathological conditions. Of importance to the aetiology of osteoporosis are findings over the past two decades attesting to a deep integration of the skeletal system with the immune system (the immunoskeletal interface (ISI)). Although protective of the skeleton under physiological conditions, the ISI might contribute to bone destruction in a growing number of pathophysiological states. Although numerous research groups have investigated how the immune system affects basal and pathological osteoclastic bone resorption, recent findings suggest that the reach of the adaptive immune response extends to the regulation of osteoblastic bone formation.

A major objection to this hypothesis is that hysteresis can be reduced by changing the interfacial contact materials; however, this is unlikely to significantly influence the behaviour of mobile ionic charge within the perovskite phase. Here, we show that the primary effects of ion migration can be observed regardless of whether the contacts were changed to give devices with or without significant hysteresis. Transient optoelectronic measurements combined with device simulations indicate that electricfield screening, consistent with ion migration, is similar in both high and low hysteresis CH3NH3PbI3 cells. Simulation of the photovoltage and photocurrent transients shows that hysteresis requires the combination of both mobile ionic charge and recombination near the perovskitecontact interfaces. Passivating contact recombination results in higher photogenerated charge concentrations at forward bias which screen the ionic charge, reducing hysteresis. Ion migration has been related to hysteresis in perovskite solar cells, but not all perovskite cells exhibit a hysteresis.

The majority of ADAM10 and ADAM17 inhibitor development has been focused on the discovery of compounds that bind the active site zinc, however, in recent years, there has been a shift from active site to secondary substrate binding site (exosite) inhibitor discovery in order to identify nonzincbinding molecules. In the present work a glycosylated, exositebinding substrate of ADAM10 and ADAM17 was utilized to screen 370,276 compounds from the MLPCN collection. As a result of this uHTS effort, a selective, timedependent, nonzincbinding inhibitor of ADAM10 with Ki  883 nM was discovered. This compound exhibited low cell toxicity and was able to selectively inhibit shedding of known ADAM10 substrates in several cellbased models. We hypothesize that differential glycosylation of these cognate substrates is the source of selectivity of our novel inhibitor.

After 24 weeks on a highfat diet (HFD), obesity, insulin resistance, hepatic steatosis and inflammatory responses are significantly ameliorated in liverspecific TRAF3knockout mice, but exacerbated in transgenic mice overexpressing TRAF3 in hepatocytes. The detrimental effects of TRAF3 on hepatic steatosis and related pathologies are confirmed in obob mice. We further show that in response to HFD, hepatocyte TRAF3 binds to TGFactivated kinase 1 (TAK1) to induce TAK1 ubiquitination and subsequent autophosphorylation, thereby enhancing the activation of downstream IKKNFB and MKKJNKIRS1307 signalling cascades, while disrupting AKTGSK3FOXO1 signalling. The TRAF3TAK1 interaction and TAK1 ubiquitination are indispensable for TRAF3regulated hepatic steatosis. In conclusion, hepatocyte TRAF3 promotes HFDinduced or genetic hepatic steatosis in a TAK1dependent manner. TRAF family proteins regulate immune signalling cascades. Here, the authors show that TRAF3 is upregulated in the liver in nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, promoting insulin resistance, inflammation and hepatic steatosis via its interaction with the kinase TAK1.\n                  \n                    \n                  \n                ", "authors": "PiXiao Wang; XiaoJing Zhang; Pengcheng Luo; Xi Jiang; Peng Zhang; Junhong Guo; GuangNian Zhao; Xueyong Zhu; Yan Zhang; Sijun Yang; Hongliang Li", "keywords": "Cell signalling; Intracellular signalling peptides and proteins; Metabolic disorders; Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease", "organization_affiliated": "Department of Cardiology, Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, China; Animal Experiment CenterAnimal Biosafety LevelIII Laboratory, Wuhan University, Wuhan, China; Department of Cardiology, Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, China; Animal Experiment CenterAnimal Biosafety LevelIII Laboratory, Wuhan University, Wuhan, China; State Key Laboratory of Quality Research in Chinese Medicine, Institute of Chinese Medical Sciences, University of Macau, Macao, China; Department of Nephrology, Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, China; Huangshi Central Hospital, Hubei Polytechnic University, Huangshi, China; Department of Cardiology, Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, China; Animal Experiment CenterAnimal Biosafety LevelIII Laboratory, Wuhan University, Wuhan, China; Department of Cardiology, Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, China; Animal Experiment CenterAnimal Biosafety LevelIII Laboratory, Wuhan University, Wuhan, China; Department of Cardiology, Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, China; Animal Experiment CenterAnimal Biosafety LevelIII Laboratory, Wuhan University, Wuhan, China; Department of Cardiology, Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, China; Animal Experiment CenterAnimal Biosafety LevelIII Laboratory, Wuhan University, Wuhan, China; Department of Cardiology, Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, China; Animal Experiment CenterAnimal Biosafety LevelIII Laboratory, Wuhan University, Wuhan, China; Department of Cardiology, Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, China; Animal Experiment CenterAnimal Biosafety LevelIII Laboratory, Wuhan University, Wuhan, China; Animal Experiment CenterAnimal Biosafety LevelIII Laboratory, Wuhan University, Wuhan, China; Department of Cardiology, Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, China; Animal Experiment CenterAnimal Biosafety LevelIII Laboratory, Wuhan University, Wuhan, China"}

Lenvatinib and Cabozantinib have shown noninferior antitumoral activities compared with the corresponding recommended therapies. The clinical trials have established recommended doses for each treatment that lead different blood concentrations in patients for Sorafenib (10 M), Regorafenib (1 M), Lenvatinib (0.1 M), and Cabozantinib (1 M). However, very low response rates are observed in patients attributed to intrinsic resistances or upregulation of survival signaling. The aim of the study was the comparative doseresponse analysis of the drugs (0100 M) in welldifferentiated (HepG2, Hep3B, and Huh7), moderately (SNU423), and poorly (SNU449) differentiated liver cancer cells in 2D3D cultures. Cells harbors wildtype p53 (HepG2), nonsense p53 mutation (Hep3B), inframe p53 gene deletion (SNU423), and p53 point mutation (Huh7 and SNU449). The administration of regular used in vitro dose (10 M) in 3D and 2D cultures, as well as the doseresponse analysis in 2D cultures showed Sorafenib and Regorafenib were increasingly effective in reducing cell proliferation, and inducing apoptosis in welldifferentiated and expressing wildtype p53 in HCC cells. Lenvatinib and Cabozantinib were particularly effective in moderately to poorly differentiated cells with mutated or lacking p53 that have lower basal oxygen consumption rate (OCR), ATP, and maximal respiration capacity than observed in differentiated HCC cells. Sorafenib and Regorafenib downregulated, and Lenvatinib and Cabozantinib upregulated epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and mesenchymalepithelial transition factor receptor (cMet) in HepG2 cells. Conclusions: Sorafenib and Regorafenib were especially active in welldifferentiated cells, with wildtype p53 and increased mitochondrial respiration. By contrast, Lenvatinib and Cabozantinib appeared more effective in moderately to poorly differentiated cells with mutated p53 and low mitochondrial respiration. The development of strategies that allow us to deliver increased doses in tumors might potentially enhance the effectiveness of the treatments.", "authors": "Maria A.

Breakdown of the threelayered renal filtration barrier results in loss of albumin into urine (albuminuria) across the wall of small renal capillaries, and is a leading cause of chronic kidney disease. However, exactly how the renal filter works and why its permeability is altered in kidney diseases is poorly understood. Here we show that the permeability of the renal filter is modulated through compression of the capillary wall. We collect morphometric data prior to and after onset of albuminuria in a mouse model equivalent to a human genetic disease affecting the renal filtration barrier. Combining quantitative analyses with mathematical modelling, we demonstrate that morphological alterations of the glomerular filtration barrier lead to reduced compressive forces that counteract filtration pressure, thereby resulting in capillary dilatation, and ultimately albuminuria. Our results reveal distinct functions of the different layers of the filtration barrier and expand the molecular understanding of defective renal filtration in chronic kidney disease. Morphological changes in kidney glomerular ultrastructure and altered compression of the glomerular basement membrane are shown to correlate with albuminuria.", "authors": "Linus Butt; David UnnersjoJess; Martin Hohne; Aurelie Edwards; Julia BinzLotter; Dervla Reilly; Robert Hahnfeldt; Vera Ziegler; Katharina Fremter; Markus M.

Galectins play a pivotal role in the regulation of this response in malignant cells. However, precise underlying mechanisms are largely unknown. Here we demonstrate that Galectin3, a pro and antiapoptotic lectin, is required for setting up a correct cellular response to stress by orchestrating several effects. First, Galectin3 constitutes a key posttranscriptional regulator of stressrelated mRNA regulons coordinating the cell metabolism, the mTORC1 complex or the unfolded protein response (UPR). Moreover, we demonstrated the presence of Galectin3 with mitochondriaassociated membranes (MAM), and its interaction with proteins located at the ER or mitochondrial membranes. There Galectin3 prevents the activation and recruitment at the mitochondria of the regulator of mitochondria fission DRP1. Accordingly, loss of Galectin3 impairs mitochondrial morphology, with more fragmented and round mitochondria, and dynamics both in normal and cancer epithelial cells in basal conditions. Importantly, Galectin3 deficient cells also display changes of the activity of the mitochondrial respiratory chain complexes, of the mTORC1S6RP4EBP1 translation pathway and reactive oxygen species levels. Regarding the ER, Galectin3 did not modify the activities of the 3 branches of the UPR in basal conditions. However, Galectin3 favours an adaptative UPR following ER stress induction by Thapsigargin treatment. Altogether, at the ERmitochondria interface, Galectin3 coordinates the functioning of the ER and mitochondria, preserves the integrity of mitochondrial network and modulates the ER stress response.", "authors": "Lucie Coppin; Arnaud Jannin; Emilie Ait Yahya; Caroline Thuillier; Celine Villenet; Meryem Tardivel; Antonino Bongiovanni; Cecile Gaston; Simon de Beco; Nicolas Barois; Isabelle van Seuningen; Emmanuelle Durand; Amelie Bonnefond; JeanClaude Vienne; Joseph Vamecq; Martin Figeac; Audrey Vincent; Delphine Delacour; Nicole Porchet; Pascal Pigny", "keywords": "Cancer metabolism; Endoplasmic reticulum; Energy metabolism", "organization_affiliated": "University of Lille, CNRS, Inserm, CHU Lille, UMR9020  UMRS 1277  Canther  Cancer Heterogeneity, Plasticity and Resistance to Therapies, Lille, France; University of Lille, CNRS, Inserm, CHU Lille, UMR9020  UMRS 1277  Canther  Cancer Heterogeneity, Plasticity and Resistance to Therapies, Lille, France; CHU Lille, Institut de Biochimie  Biologie Moleculaire, Centre de Biologie et Pathologie, Lille, France; CHU Lille, Institut de Genetique, Centre de Biologie et Pathologie, Lille, France; University of Lille, CHU Lille, Plateforme de genomique fonctionnelle, Centre de Biologie et Pathologie, Lille, France; University of Lille, Lille, France; University of Lille, Lille, France; Equipe Cell adhesion and mechanics, Institut Jacques Monod  UMR 7592 CNRS  Universite Paris Diderot, Paris Cedex 13, France; Equipe Cell adhesion and mechanics, Institut Jacques Monod  UMR 7592 CNRS  Universite Paris Diderot, Paris Cedex 13, France; University of Lille, CNRS, Inserm, CHU Lille, Institut Pasteur de Lille, U1019  UMR 8204  CIIL  Center for Infection and Immunity of Lille, Lille, France; University of Lille, CNRS, Inserm, CHU Lille, UMR9020  UMRS 1277  Canther  Cancer Heterogeneity, Plasticity and Resistance to Therapies, Lille, France; University of Lille, CNRS, CHU Lille, Institut Pasteur de Lille, UMR 8199, EGID, Lille, France; University of Lille, CNRS, CHU Lille, Institut Pasteur de Lille, UMR 8199, EGID, Lille, France; CHU Lille, Institut de Biochimie  Biologie Moleculaire, Centre de Biologie et Pathologie, Lille, France; CHU Lille, Institut de Biochimie  Biologie Moleculaire, Centre de Biologie et Pathologie, Lille, France; University of Lille, CHU Lille, Plateforme de genomique fonctionnelle, Centre de Biologie et Pathologie, Lille, France; University of Lille, CNRS, Inserm, CHU Lille, UMR9020  UMRS 1277  Canther  Cancer Heterogeneity, Plasticity and Resistance to Therapies, Lille, France; Equipe Cell adhesion and mechanics, Institut Jacques Monod  UMR 7592 CNRS  Universite Paris Diderot, Paris Cedex 13, France; University of Lille, CNRS, Inserm, CHU Lille, UMR9020  UMRS 1277  Canther  Cancer Heterogeneity, Plasticity and Resistance to Therapies, Lille, France; University of Lille, CNRS, Inserm, CHU Lille, UMR9020  UMRS 1277  Canther  Cancer Heterogeneity, Plasticity and Resistance to Therapies, Lille, France"}

Here we provide compelling evidence that genetic, neuronal, and vascular activities of the brainstem's dorsal vagal complex are subject to intrinsic circadian control with a crucial role for the connection between its components in regulating their rhythmic properties. Robust 24 h variation in clock gene expression in vivo and neuronal firing ex vivo were observed in the area postrema (AP) and nucleus of the solitary tract (NTS), together with enhanced nocturnal responsiveness to metabolic cues. Unexpectedly, we also find functional and molecular evidence for increased penetration of blood borne molecules into the NTS at night. Our findings reveal that the hindbrain houses a local network complex of neuronal and nonneuronal autonomous circadian oscillators, with clear implications for understanding local temporal control of physiology in the brainstem. Lukasz Chrobok, Rebecca Northeast et al. show circadian variation in clock gene expression and neuronal firing within the area postrema and the nucleus of the solitary tract in mice. These regions also exhibit variation in metabolic processes and bloodbrain barrier permeability across the 24 hour cycle suggesting the presence of circadian oscillators within the dorsal vagal complex.", "authors": "Lukasz Chrobok; Rebecca C.

Beak and feather disease virus (BFDV) poses a major threat worldwide to wild and captive parrots. Yet data from wild birds on seasonal fluctuations in prevalence and infection intensity, and thereby the potential highrisk times for virus transmission, have been lacking. We screened wild Crimson Rosellas (Platycercus elegans) for BFDV in blood and cloacal swabs. Prevalence in blood samples and cloacal swabs, as well as viral load varied with Julian date and in blood, were highest after the breeding season. Breeding birds had lower viral load and lower BFDV prevalence in blood than nonbreeding birds (10.1% prevalence in breeding vs. 43.2% in nonbreeding birds). BFDV prevalence was much higher in younger (3 years) than older (3 years) birds for both blood samples (42.9% vs. 4.5%) and cloacal swabs (56.4% vs. 12.3%). BFDV status in blood and cloacal samples was not correlated within individuals. We show that, at least in P. elegans, BFDV infection seems to occur yearround, with seasonal changes in prevalence and load found in our samples. Our analyses suggest that the seasonal changes were associated primarily with the breeding season. We also discuss age and sex as important predictors of BFDV infection.", "authors": "Johanne M.

Advanced therapeutic regimens are needed to control UC development and recurrence. We pursued in vitro and in vivo studies to understand the ability of a triple combination of gemcitabine, romidepsin, and cisplatin (GemRomCis) to modulate signalling pathways, cell death, drug resistance, and tumour development. Our studies verified the ability of GemRomCis to synergistically induce apoptotic cell death and reduce drug resistance in various UC cells. The ERK pathway and reactive oxygen species (ROS) played essential roles in mediating GemRomCisinduced caspase activation, DNA oxidation and damage, glutathione reduction, and unfolded protein response. GemRomCis preferentially induced death and reduced drug resistance in oncogenic HRasexpressing UC vs. counterpart cells that was associated with transcriptomic profiles related to ROS, cell death, and drug resistance.

The pathogenic link between skin disease and systemic exacerbations in SLE remains elusive. In an acute model of UVBtriggered inflammation, we observed that a single UV exposure triggered a striking IFNI signature not only in the skin, but also in the blood and kidneys. The early IFNI signature was significantly higher in female compared to male mice. The early IFNI response in the skin was almost entirely, and in the blood partly, dependent on the presence of cGAS, as was skin inflammatory cell infiltration. Inhibition of cGAMP hydrolysis augmented the UVBtriggered IFNI response. UVB skin exposure leads to cGASactivation and both local and systemic IFNI signature and could contribute to acute flares of disease in susceptible subjects such as patients with SLE.", "authors": "Sladjana SkopeljaGardner; Jie An; Joyce Tai; Lena Tanaka; Xizhang Sun; Payton Hermanson; Rebecca Baum; Masaoki Kawasumi; Richard Green; Michael Gale Jr.; Andrea Kalus; Victoria P.

However, as more than 50% of patients are ineligible for cisplatinbased chemotherapy, there is an urgent need to develop new drugs. Cuprous oxide nanoparticles (CONPs), as a new nanotherapeutic agent, have been proved to be effective in many kinds of tumors. In the present study, CONPs showed dosedependent and timedependent inhibitory effects on various bladder cancer cell lines (T24, J82, 5637, and UMUC3) and weak inhibitory effects on noncancerous epithelial cells (SVHUCs). We found that CONPs induced cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in bladder cancer cells. We further demonstrated that the potential mechanisms of CONPinduced cytotoxicity were apoptosis, which was triggered by reactive oxygen species through activation of ERK signaling pathway, and autophagy. Moreover, the cytotoxic effect of CONPs on bladder cancer was confirmed both in orthotopic xenografts and subcutaneous nude mouse models, indicating that CONPs could significantly suppress the growth of bladder cancer in vivo. In further drug combination experiments, we showed that CONPs had a synergistic drugdrug interaction with cisplatin and gemcitabine in vitro, both of which are commonly used chemotherapy agents for bladder cancer. We further proved that CONPs potentiated the antitumor activity of gemcitabine in vivo without exacerbating the adverse effects, suggesting that CONPs and gemcitabine can be used for combination intravesical chemotherapy. In conclusion, our preclinical data demonstrate that CONPs are a promising nanomedicine against bladder cancer and provide good insights into the application of CONPs and gemcitabine in combination for intravesical bladder cancer treatment.", "authors": "Qiao Xiong; Anwei Liu; Qian Ren; Yongping Xue; Xiaowen Yu; Yidie Ying; Hongliang Gao; Haoyuan Tan; Zhensheng Zhang; Wei Li; Shuxiong Zeng; Chuanliang Xu", "keywords": "Bladder cancer; Drug development", "organization_affiliated": "Department of Urology, Changhai Hospital, Second Military Medical University, Shanghai, P.

These prealpha cells exhibit a transcriptional profile similar to mature alpha cells and although they produce proinsulin protein, they do not secrete significant amounts of processed insulin. Compound screening identified a protein kinase c activator that promotes maturation of prealpha cells into SCalpha cells. The resulting SCalpha cells do not express insulin, share an ultrastructure similar to cadaveric alpha cells, express and secrete glucagon in response to glucose and some glucagon secretagogues, and elevate blood glucose upon transplantation in mice.

Among 776 nonmolar gestations, 644 were diploid without chromosomal aneuploidies detectable by STR genotyping and 132 had various genetic abnormalities including 122 cases of various trisomies, 2 triploid digynicmonoandric nonmolar gestations, 7 cases of possible chromosomal monosomy or uniparental disomy. Successful followup was achieved in 165 complete moles: postmolar gestational trophoblastic disease developed in 11.6% (16138 cases) of homozygous complete moles and 37.0% (1027 cases) of heterozygous complete moles. The difference between the two groups was highly significant (p  0.0009, chisquare). None of the 218 partial moles and 367 nonmolar gestations developed postmolar gestational trophoblastic disease. In conclusion, heterozygousdispermic complete moles are clinically more aggressive with a significantly higher risk for development of postmolar gestational trophoblastic disease compared with homozygousmonospermic complete moles. Therefore, precise genotyping classification of complete moles is important for clinical prognosis and patient management.", "authors": "XingZheng Zheng; XuYing Qin; SuWen Chen; Peng Wang; Yang Zhan; PingPing Zhong; Natalia Buza; YuLan Jin; BingQuan Wu; Pei Hui", "keywords": "Genetics; Risk factors", "organization_affiliated": "Department of Pathology, Beijing Obstetrics and Gynecology Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing, China; Department of Molecular Pathology, Beijing TaipuShunkang Institute for Laboratory Medicine, Beijing, China; Department of Birth Control, Beijing Obstetrics and Gynecology Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing, China; Department of Molecular Pathology, Beijing TaipuShunkang Institute for Laboratory Medicine, Beijing, China; Department of Pathology, Beijing Obstetrics and Gynecology Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing, China; Department of Pathology, Beijing Obstetrics and Gynecology Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing, China; Department of Pathology, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, USA; Department of Pathology, Beijing Obstetrics and Gynecology Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing, China; Department of Pathology, Peking University Health Sciences Center, Beijing, China; Department of Pathology, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, USA"}

Although several scholars have questioned the authenticity of the information contained in the thug archive, that is, the corpus of colonial knowledge about the thugs, Martine van Wrkens and Tihanyi (The strangled traveler: colonial imaginings and the thugs of India. University of Chicago Press, Chicago, 2002) and Macfie (Rethinking Hist 12(3):383397, 2008) argue that the very phenomenon as it was known to the British, was an orientalist construct. However, though the orientalist and romantic genesis of the thug imagery has been well established, the precise nature, reasons, and implications of the same largely remain \"terra incognita\". This article examines the discovery of the thugs and analyzes parts of the thugarchive through the concept of the monster as elaborated by Mary Douglas (Purity and danger: an analysis of concepts of pollution and taboo. Routledge, New York, 1966), Victor Turner (\"Betwixt and between: the liminal period in rites de passage\". The forest of symbols. Ithaca, NY: Cornell University Press, 1967) and Michel Foucault et al. (Abnormal: lectures at the College de France, 19741975. Picador, New York, 2003), and establishes the thug as an epistemological monster emerging from the cracks and gaps in colonial information gathering mechanisms that arose as a result of the changing nature of the Indian \"state\" and the employment of alien categories for demographic knowledge production. The key question here is: how can we explain the sudden appearance of thugs in the colonial archive in the 1830s and the disproportionate interest of the administration in eradicating them? This article analyzes the journalistic and legal discourse surrounding the thugs in the nineteenth century and tries to demonstrate how the notion of the \"monster\" can act as a methodological tool in explaining the efforts of the Thug Department. The argument is then concluded through an investigation into the implications of the discovery of the thugs for the teleology of Indian history and the consequence of \"othering\" tribal and other anomic populations in the new Weberian state that the colonial and postcolonial regimes envisioned to establish.", "authors": "Sagnik Bhattacharya", "keywords": "Cultural and media studies; History", "organization_affiliated": "University of Groningen, Groningen, The Netherlands"}

Here, we report on terahertzfield driven highharmonic generation in the threedimensional Dirac semimetal Cd3As2 at room temperature. Excited by linearlypolarized multicycle terahertz pulses, the third, fifth, and seventhorder harmonic generation is very efficient and detected via timeresolved spectroscopic techniques. The observed harmonic radiation is further studied as a function of pumppulse fluence. Their fluence dependence is found to deviate evidently from the expected powerlaw dependence in the perturbative regime. The observed highly nonperturbative behavior is reproduced based on our analysis of the intraband kinetics of the terahertzfield driven nonequilibrium state using the Boltzmann transport theory. Our results indicate that the driven nonlinear kinetics of the Dirac electrons plays the central role for the observed highly nonlinear response.

As such in the work we compared ion transport in poly (1butyl3vinylimidazoliumtetrafluoroborate) (poly (BVIM]BF4])) polyIL and 1butyl3methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate (BMIM]BF4]) IL. The diffusivities of ions in the polyIL and IL were measured and computed. According to the results of the molecular dynamics simulations performed, in the IL the coupling motion between an anion and the ions around determines the ion diffusivities, and the ion association lifetime gives the time scale of ion transport. But in the polyIL, the hopping of an anion among cages composed of cationic branch chains determines the diffusivity, and the associated anion transport time scale is the trap time, which is the time when an anion is caught inside a cage, not the ion association lifetime, as Mogurampelly et al. regarded. The calculation results of average displacements (ADs) of the polyIL chains show that, besides free volume fraction, average amplitudes of the oscillation of chains and chain translation speed lead to various diffusivities at various temperatures.", "authors": "Wangchuan Xiao; Quan Yang; Shenlin Zhu", "keywords": "Fluids; Structural properties", "organization_affiliated": "School of Resources and Chemical Engineering, Sanming University, Fujian, China; School of Resources and Chemical Engineering, Sanming University, Fujian, China; Department of Chemical Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"}

HIV1 must express all of its gene products from a single primary transcript, which undergoes alternative splicing to produce diverse protein products that include structural proteins and regulatory factors1,2. Despite the critical role of alternative splicing, the mechanisms that drive the choice of splice site are poorly understood. Synonymous RNA mutations that lead to severe defects in splicing and viral replication indicate the presence of unknown cisregulatory elements3. Here we use dimethyl sulfate mutational profiling with sequencing (DMSMaPseq) to investigate the structure of HIV1 RNA in cells, and develop an algorithm that we name 'detection of RNA folding ensembles using expectationmaximization' (DREEM), which reveals the alternative conformations that are assumed by the same RNA sequence. Contrary to previous models that have analysed population averages4, our results reveal heterogeneous regions of RNA structure across the entire HIV1 genome. In addition to confirming that in vitro characterized5 alternative structures for the HIV1 Rev responsive element also exist in cells, we discover alternative conformations at critical splice sites that influence the ratio of transcript isoforms. Our simultaneous measurement of splicing and intracellular RNA structure provides evidence for the longstanding hypothesis68 that heterogeneity in RNA conformation regulates splicesite use and viral gene expression.

Ribs and vertebrae are integral to this locomotor mode, but 3D motion of the axial skeleton has not been reported for lizard locomotion. Here, we use XROMM to quantify the relative motions of the vertebrae and ribs during slow treadmill locomotion in three savannah monitor lizards (Varanus exanthematicus) and three Argentine black and white tegus (Salvator merianae). To isolate locomotion, we selected strides with no concurrent lung ventilation. Rib rotations can be decomposed into buckethandle rotation around a dorsoventral axis, pumphandle rotation around a mediolateral axis, and caliper rotations around a craniocaudal axis. During locomotion, every rib measured in both species rotated substantially around its costovertebral joint (817 degrees, summed across bucket, pump and caliper rotations). In all individuals from both species, the middle ribs rotated cranially through bucket and pumphandle motion during the propulsive phase of the ipsilateral forelimb. Axial kinematics during swing phase of the ipsilateral forelimb were mirror images of the propulsive phase. Although further work is needed to establish what causes these rib motions, active contraction of the hypaxial musculature may be at least partly responsible. Unilateral locomotor rib movements are remarkably similar to the bilateral pattern used for lung ventilation, suggesting a new hypothesis that rib motion during locomotion may have been an exaptation for the evolution of costal aspiration breathing in stem amniotes.", "authors": "Robert L.

The resulting chemiresistor devices, however, suffer from nonlinear responses, signal fluctuations and gas crosssensitivities, which limits their use in demanding applications of airquality monitoring. Here, we show that conventional semiconducting metal oxide materials can provide highperformance sensors using an impedance measurement technique. Our approach is based on dielectric excitation measurements and yields sensors with a linear gas response (R2  0.99), broad dynamic range of gas detection (six decades of concentrations) and high baseline stability, as well as reduced humidity and ambienttemperature effects. We validated the technique using a range of commercial sensing elements and a range of gases in both laboratory and field conditions. Our approach can be applied to both n and ptype semiconducting metal oxide materials, and we show that it can be used in wireless sensor networks, and dronebased and wearable environmental and industrial gas monitoring.

In multilayered Dirac fermion systems, the density of Dirac fermions on the zeroth Landau levels (LLs) increases in proportion to the magnetic field, resulting in intriguing angle and fielddependent interlayer tunneling conductivity near the quantum limit. BaGa2 is an example of a multilayered Dirac semimetal with its quasi2D Dirac cone located at EF, providing a good platform to study its interlayer transport properties. In this paper, we report the negative interlayer magnetoresistance induced by the tunneling of Dirac fermions between the zeroth LLs of neighboring Ga layers in BaGa2. When the field deviates from the caxis, the interlayer resistivity zz() increases and finally results in a peak with the applied field perpendicular to the caxis. These unusual interlayer transport properties are observed together in the Dirac semimetal under ambient pressure and are well explained by the model of tunneling between Dirac fermions in the quantum limit. The transport behavior at the quantum limit may show exotic phenomena such as special interlayer quantum transport.

In this study, we identified withingroup neural synchronization in the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (rDLPFC) and the right temporoparietal junction (rTPJ) as a candidate mechanism underlying intergroup hostility. We organized 546 individuals into 91 threeversusthreeperson intergroup competitions, induced ingroup bonding or nobonding control manipulation and measured neural activity and withingroup synchronization using functional nearinfrared spectroscopy. After ingroup bonding (versus control), individuals gave more money to ingroup members than to outgroup members and contributed more money to outcompete their rivals. Ingroup bonding decreased rDLPFC activity and increased functional connectivity between the rDLPFC and the rTPJ. Especially during the outgroup attack, ingroup bonding also increased withingroup synchronization in both the rDLPFC and the rTPJ, and withingroup rDLPFC synchronization positively correlated with intergroup hostility. Withingroup synchronized reduction in prefrontal activity might explain how ingroup bonding leads to impulsive and collective hostility toward outsiders.

Herein, a model EG that does not require any charging process by utilising the spontaneous orientation polarisation of 1,3,5tris(1phenyl1Hbenzimidazole2yl)benzene (TPBi) is demonstrated. The surface potential (Vsp) of an evaporated TPBi film has reached 30.2 V at a film thickness of 500 nm without using a charging process. The estimated  of 1.7 mC m2 is comparable with that obtained using a conventional polymerbased electret after charging. Furthermore, Vsp is considerably stable in environmental conditions; thus, TPBi can be considered to be \"selfassembled\" electret (SAE).

This spontaneously retreating subduction is enabled by the development of faults at the edges of the slab, but the physical mechanisms controlling fault propagation and direction remain unknown. Here, using 3D numerical subduction models we show that oceanic lithosphere recycling is mainly controlled by the intensity of straininduced weakening of fractures forming at the edges of the slab. Intense straininduced weakening causes predominantly brittle fault propagation and slab narrowing until detachment. Without weakening, preponderantly ductile slab edge propagation occurs, which causes slab widening. This rheological control is not affected by the proximity of nonweakened passive continental margins. Natural examples suggest that slab edges follow convergent paths that could be controlled by fractures weakening due to deep water penetration into the oceanic lithosphere. Retreating subduction zones are enabled by the development of faults at the edges of the slab, but the physical mechanisms controlling fault propagation remain debated.

In this study, we show for the first time that during vitrification of the mouse ovary, the attachment of the oocyte to the granulosa cells was impaired by the loss of the cadherin adhesion molecules. Importantly, exposure to a high osmotic solution greatly decreased the ratio of oocyte diameter to the diameter of its follicle but did not alter the collagenrich matrix surrounding the follicles. By treating ovaries briefly with collagenase before exposure to the hyperosmotic solution the ratio of oocyte diameter to follicle diameter was maintained, and cadherin adhesion junctions were preserved. When frozenthawed ovaries were transplanted to the bursa of recipient hosts, pretreatment with collagenase significantly increased serum levels of AMH, the number of intact follicles and the total number of viable offspring compared to frozenthawed ovaries without collagenase pretreatment, even 6 months after transplantation. Thus, the collagenase pretreatment could provide a beneficial approach for maintaining the functions and viability of cryopreserved ovaries in other species and clinically relevant situations.", "authors": "Tomoko Kawai; Masayuki Shimada", "keywords": "Biotechnology; Cell biology", "organization_affiliated": "Laboratory of Reproductive Endocrinology, Graduate School of Integrated Sciences for Life, Hiroshima University, Hiroshima, Japan; Laboratory of Reproductive Endocrinology, Graduate School of Integrated Sciences for Life, Hiroshima University, Hiroshima, Japan"}

There is little understanding of the participation of each TRPC in each pathology, considering functional redundancy. Also, most of the inhibitors available are not specific. Thus, we developed mice that lack all of the TRPCs and performed a transcriptome analysis in eight tissues. The aim of this research was to address the impact of the absence of all TRPC channels on gene expression. We obtained a total of 4305 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in at least one tissue where spleen showed the highest number of DEGs (1371). Just 21 genes were modified in all the tissues. Performing a pathway enrichment analysis, we found that many important signaling pathways were modified in more than one tissue, including PI3K (phosphatidylinositol 3kinaseprotein kinaseB) signaling pathway, cytokinecytokine receptor interaction, extracellular matrix (ECM)receptor interaction and circadian rhythms.

While NEC is associated with microbial invasion of intestinal tissues, and mucus modulates interactions between microbes and underlying tissues, variations in mucus barrier properties with NECassociated risk factors have not been investigated. This study explored differences in mucus composition (total protein, DNA, mucin content, sialic acid, and immunoregulatory proteins), as well as structural and transport properties, assessed by tracking of particles and bacteria (E. coli and E. cloacae) with developmental age and exposure to NEC stressors in Sprague Dawley rats. Early developmental age (5 day old) was characterized by a more permeable mucus layer relative to 21 day old pups, suggesting immaturity may contribute to exposure of the epithelium to microbes. Exposure to NEC stressors was associated with reduced mucus permeability, which may aid in survival. Feeding with breastmilk as opposed to formula reduces incidence of NEC. Thus, NECstressed (NS) rat pups were orally dosed with breastmilk components lysozyme (NSLYS) or docosahexaenoic acid (NSDHA). NSLYS and NSDHA pups had a less permeable mucus barrier relative to NS pups, which suggests the potential of these factors to strengthen the mucus barrier and thus protect against disease.", "authors": "Jaclyn Y.

In addition to demonstrating the utility of FSIC for mapping featurespecific reactivation, these findings resolve the contributions of low and highlevel features to the vividness of visual memories and challenge a strict interpretation the posteriortoanterior visual hierarchy.

Here, to retrace the spread of this clone and to identify drivers of its specific success, we investigated a representative collection of 250 S. capitis isolates from adults and newborns. Bayesian analyses confirmed the spread of the NRCSA clone and enabled us to date its emergence in the late 1960s and its expansion during the 1980s, coinciding with the establishment of NICUs and the increasing use of vancomycin in these units, respectively. This dynamic was accompanied by the acquisition of mutations in antimicrobial resistance and bacteriocinencoding genes. Furthermore, combined statistical tools and a genomewide association study convergently point to vancomycin resistance as a major driver of NRCSA success. We also identified another S. capitis subclade (alpha clade) that emerged independently, showing parallel evolution towards NICU specialization and nonsusceptibility to vancomycin, indicating convergent evolution in NICUassociated pathogens. These findings illustrate how the broad use of antibiotics can repeatedly lead initially commensal drugsusceptible bacteria to evolve into multidrugresistant clones that are able to successfully spread worldwide and become pathogenic for highly vulnerable patients.

A model target, the CDK inhibitor Sic1, contains linear phosphorylation motifs, docking sites, and phosphodegrons to empower an NtoC terminally directed phosphorylation process. Here, we uncover a signal processing mechanism involving multistep competition between mutually diversional phosphorylation routes within the SCDKSic1 inhibitory complex. Intracomplex phosphorylation plays a direct role in controlling Sic1 degradation, and provides a mechanism to sequentially integrate both the G1 and SCDK activities while keeping SCDK inhibited towards other targets. The competing phosphorylation routes prevent premature Sic1 degradation and demonstrate how integration of MAPK from the pheromone pathway allows one to tune the competition of alternative phosphorylation paths. The mutually diversional phosphorylation circuits may be a general way for processing multiple kinase signals to coordinate cellular decisions in eukaryotes. The decision of whether and when a cell divides is tightly controlled.

We hypothesized that ML can be used to create models to predict postoperative mortality, AKI, reintubation, and a combined outcome using a single set of features available at the end of surgery.

We conducted a search until May 2019, obtaining 16 articles from which 30 independent studies were extracted, which were considered as units of analysis. Four outcome measures were extracted from each study: retention, marginal integrity, anatomic form, and absence of recurrent caries. Separate metaanalyses were carried for each outcome and multiple metaregression model was applied. The outcomes with the highest mean success rates were absence of recurrent caries and anatomic form. The type of material significantly influenced success rates. The best materials were resinbased material plus totaletching adhesion and resinmodified glass ionomer cement (RMGIC), and the worst high viscosity glass ionomer cement (HVGIC). Atraumatic restorative treatment (ART) had a lower success rate than the conventional cavity form. RMGIC had the best clinical performance and HVGIC the worst. The form of the cavity, blinding and the experience of the operator were the variables that influenced success rates. Proximal primary molar restorations should be performed with RMGIC as it combines good mechanical performance of the resins together with the prevention of secondary caries of glass ionomers.", "authors": "Antonio J.

YAP1TEAD complex activates the oncogenic downstream transcription, such as CTGF and cMyc. How YAP1 is protected in the cytoplasm from ubiquitinmediated degradation remains elusive. In this study, a member of Angiomotin (Motin) family, AMOTL1 (Angiomotin Like 1), was screened out as the only one to promote YAP1 nuclear accumulation by several clinical cohorts, which was further confirmed by the cellular functional assays. The interaction between YAP1 and AMOTL1 was suggested by coimmunoprecipitation and immunofluorescent staining. The clinical significance of the AMOTL1YAP1CTGF axis in gastric cancer (GC) was analyzed by multiple clinical cohorts. Moreover, the therapeutic effect of targeting the oncogenic axis was appraised by drugsensitivity tests and xenograftformation assays. The upregulation of AMOTL1 is associated with unfavorable clinical outcomes of GC, and knocking down AMOTL1 impairs its oncogenic properties. The cytoplasmic interaction between AMOTL1 and YAP1 protects each other from ubiquitinmediated degradation. AMOTL1 promotes YAP1 translocation into the nuclei to activate the downstream expression, such as CTGF. Knocking down AMOTL1, YAP1, and CTGF enhances the therapeutic efficacies of the firstline anticancer drugs. Taken together, AMOTL1 plays an oncogenic role in gastric carcinogenesis through interacting with YAP1 and promoting its nuclear accumulation. A combination of AMOTL1, YAP1, and CTGF expression might serve as a surrogate of Hippo activation status. The coactivation of the AMOTL1YAP1CTGF axis is associated with poor clinical outcomes of GC patients, and targeting this oncogenic axis may enhance the chemotherapeutic effects.", "authors": "Yuhang Zhou; Jinglin Zhang; Hui Li; Tingting Huang; Chi Chun Wong; Feng Wu; Man Wu; Nuoqing Weng; Liping Liu; Alfred S.

We and others identified tumorassociated macrophages (TAM) in the ascites as promoters of metastasisassociated processes like extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling, tumor cell migration, adhesion, and invasion. The precise mechanisms and mediators involved in these functions of TAM are, however, largely unknown. We observed that HGSC migration is promoted by soluble mediators from ascitesderived TAM, which can be emulated by conditioned medium from monocytederived macrophages (MDM) differentiated in ascites to TAMlike ascMDM. A similar effect was observed with IL10induced alternatively activated m2cMDM but not with LPSIFNinduced inflammatory m1MDM. These observations provided the basis for deconvolution of the complex TAM secretome by performing comparative secretome analysis of matched triplets of different MDM phenotypes with different promigratory properties (ascMDM, m2cMDM, m1MDM). Mass spectrometric analysis identified an overlapping set of nine proteins secreted by both ascMDM and m2cMDM, but not by m1MDM. Of these, three proteins, i.e., transforming growth factor betainduced (TGFBI) protein, tenascin C (TNC), and fibronectin (FN1), have been associated with migrationrelated functions. Intriguingly, increased ascites concentrations of TGFBI, TNC, and fibronectin were associated with short progressionfree survival. Furthermore, transcriptome and secretome analyses point to TAM as major producers of these proteins, further supporting an essential role for TAM in promoting HGSC progression. Consistent with this hypothesis, we were able to demonstrate that the migrationinducing potential of ascMDM and m2cMDM secretomes is inhibited, at least partially, by neutralizing antibodies against TGFBI and TNC or siRNAmediated silencing of TGFBI expression. In conclusion, the present study provides the first experimental evidence that TAMderived TGFBI and TNC in ascites promote HGSC progression.", "authors": "Anna Mary Steitz; Alina Steffes; Florian Finkernagel; Annika Unger; Leah Sommerfeld; Julia M.

We utilize fluorescent reporter mice (Otrvenus) and find that cortical regions show temporally and spatially heterogeneous patterns with transient postnatal OTR expression without cell death. Cortical OTR cells are largely glutamatergic neurons with the exception of cells in layer 6b. Subcortical regions show similar temporal regulation except the hypothalamus and two hypothalamic nuclei display sexually dimorphic OTR expression. Lack of OTR expression correlates with reduced dendritic spine densities in selected cortical regions of developing brains. Lastly, we create a website to visualize our highresolution imaging data. In summary, our research provides a comprehensive resource for postnatal OTR expression in the mouse brain.

However, emerging clinical evidence suggests that radiotherapy can be incorporated into multimodality therapy regimens beyond ADT, in combinations that include chemotherapy, radiosensitizing agents, immunotherapy and surgery for the treatment of men with localized and locally advanced prostate cancer, and those with oligometastatic disease, in whom the low metastatic burden in particular might be treatable with these combinations. This multimodal approach is increasingly recognized as offering considerable clinical benefit, such as increased antitumour effects and improved survival. Thus, radiotherapy is becoming a key component of multimodal therapy for many stages of prostate cancer, particularly oligometastatic disease. Radiotherapy is a common treatment for men with prostate cancer, particular in combination with androgen deprivation. However, various factors can limit the dose of radiation that can be administered, so the effect might be suboptimal. In this Review, the authors discuss how radiotherapy could be optimized by combining with other treatments in a multimodal approach, particularly in the setting of oligometastatic disease. \n              \n                \n                  \n                \n                \n                  \n                \n                \n                  \n                \n                \n                  \n                \n                \n                  \n                \n              \n            ", "authors": "Yiannis Philippou; Hanna Sjoberg; Alastair D.

YTHDF2, an m6A reader, was shown to be associated with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patient prognosis. However, the effect of YTHDF2 on liver CSC and cancer metastasis and the molecular mechanism of this effect have not been documented. Here, we show that YTHDF2 expression is negatively correlated with HCC patient survival in both data from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database and clinical data from our center. By detecting CD133 cells and carrying out sphere culture assays, we found that knockdown of YTHDF2 led to impaired stemness in Hep3B and Huh7 cells. In contrast, overexpression of YTHDF2 increased the CSC phenotype. Mechanistically, the knockdown and overexpression of YTHDF2 in liver cancer cells resulted in decreased and increased m6A levels in the 5untranslated region (UTR) of OCT4 mRNA, respectively, leading to decreased and increased OCT4 protein expression, respectively. A luciferase activity assay showed that mutation of the corresponding m6A methylation sequence in the 5UTR of OCT4 mRNA caused significantly decreased gene expression, suggesting a role for YTHDF2dependent m6A methylation in protein translation. Polysome profiling results also indicated the knockdown and overexpression of YTHDF2 could decrease and increase OCT4 translation, respectively. In particular, overexpression of OCT4 rescued the impaired stemness caused by YTHDF2 depletion, which confirmed the effect of YTHDF2 on CSC phenotype is dependent on OCT4. In vivo, the loss of YTHDF2 reduced tumor burden and inhibited lung metastasis following orthotopic transplantation in nude mice. Last, we demonstrated that YTHDF2 expression is positively correlated with OCT4 expression and m6A levels in the 5UTR of OCT4 mRNA in clinical HCC specimens. In conclusion, YTHDF2 promotes the CSC liver phenotype and cancer metastasis by modulating the m6A methylation of OCT4 mRNA.", "authors": "Chuanzhao Zhang; Shanzhou Huang; Hongkai Zhuang; Shiye Ruan; Zixuan Zhou; Kaijun Huang; Fei Ji; Zuyi Ma; Baohua Hou; Xiaoshun He", "keywords": "Cancer stem cells; Liver cancer", "organization_affiliated": "Department of General Surgery, Guangdong Provincial People's Hospital, Guangdong Academy of Medical Sciences, School of Medicine, South China University of Technology, Guangzhou, China; Department of General Surgery, Guangdong Provincial People's Hospital, Guangdong Academy of Medical Sciences, School of Medicine, South China University of Technology, Guangzhou, China; Department of General Surgery, Guangdong Provincial People's Hospital, Guangdong Academy of Medical Sciences, School of Medicine, South China University of Technology, Guangzhou, China; Shantou University of Medical College, Shantou, China; Department of General Surgery, Guangdong Provincial People's Hospital, Guangdong Academy of Medical Sciences, School of Medicine, South China University of Technology, Guangzhou, China; Department of General Surgery, Guangdong Provincial People's Hospital, Guangdong Academy of Medical Sciences, School of Medicine, South China University of Technology, Guangzhou, China; Department of General Surgery, Guangdong Provincial People's Hospital, Guangdong Academy of Medical Sciences, School of Medicine, South China University of Technology, Guangzhou, China; Department of General Surgery, Guangdong Provincial People's Hospital, Guangdong Academy of Medical Sciences, School of Medicine, South China University of Technology, Guangzhou, China; Department of General Surgery, Guangdong Provincial People's Hospital, Guangdong Academy of Medical Sciences, School of Medicine, South China University of Technology, Guangzhou, China; Shantou University of Medical College, Shantou, China; Department of General Surgery, Guangdong Provincial People's Hospital, Guangdong Academy of Medical Sciences, School of Medicine, South China University of Technology, Guangzhou, China; Organ Transplant Center, The First Affiliated Hospital, Sun Yatsen University, Guangzhou, China"}

The clinical use of SCs in nerve regeneration strategies is hindered by the necessity of removing a healthy nerve to obtain the therapeutic cells. Adiposederived stem cells (ASCs) can be chemically differentiated towards a SClike phenotype (dASCs), and represent a promising alternative to SCs. Their physiology can be further modulated pharmacologically by targeting receptors for neurotransmitters such as acetylcholine (ACh). In this study, we compare the ability of rat dASCs and native SCs to produce NGF in vitro. We also evaluate the ability of muscarinic receptors, in particular the M2 subtype, to modulate NGF production and maturation from the precursor (proNGF) to the mature (mNGF) form. For the first time, we demonstrate that dASCs produce higher basal levels of proNGF and mature NGF compared to SCs. Moreover, muscarinic receptor activation, and in particular M2 subtype stimulation, modulates NGF production and maturation in both SCs and dASCs. Indeed, both cell types express both proNGF A and B isoforms, as well as mNGF. After M2 receptor stimulation, proNGFB (25 kDa), which is involved in apoptotic processes, is strongly reduced at transcript and protein level. Thus, we demonstrate that dASCs possess a stronger neurotrophic potential compared to SCs.

Based on the complete firmlevel transaction records of the EU ETS Phases I and II, here we show that the participating firms' trading profits and their emission abatements are positively correlated, and the correlation becomes stronger in Phase II than Phase I. Specifically, we observe that nonlinearity exists in the correlation; higher firmlevel emission abatements can realize larger trading profits. This pattern affects the market fairness, though it may be helpful to incentivise emission abatements. The correlation is more regulated in Phase II than it is in Phase I, thereby indicating that the Phase II is more mature. We also observe that the statelevel abatements are largely driven by industrial giants. Carbon emission trading is an important marketbased policy instrument to reduce GHG emission using rewardpunishment mechanism.

These subjects were followed up until 2017 to determine AF development. The presence of anemia (Hb level 13 gdL in men and 12 gdL in women) was a significant risk factor for AF development. However, Hb levels showed a Ushaped association with incident AF after adjustment for cardiovascular risk factors. AF incidence was lowest at Hb levels of 1414.9 gdL in men and 1212.9 gdL in women. Among individuals with Hb levels within normal ranges (1315.9 gdL in men and 1214.9 gdL in women), both decrease and increase in Hb levels at the second measurement outside the normal ranges showed an elevation of AF risk by 11% and 21% for men and 3% and 36% for women, respectively, compared with those who maintained normal Hb levels.

Here, we experimentally demonstrate hightemperature IR camouflage with efficient thermal management. By combining a silica aerogel for thermal insulation and a GeZnS multilayer wavelengthselective emitter for simultaneous radiative cooling (high emittance in the 58 m nonatmospheric window) and IR camouflage (low emittance in the 814 m atmospheric window), the surface temperature of an object is reduced from 873 to 410 K. The IR camouflage is demonstrated by indooroutdoor (withwithout earthshine) radiation temperatures of 310248 K for an object at 873623 K and a 78% reduction in withearthshine lockon range. This scheme may introduce opportunities for hightemperature thermal management and infrared signal processing. The infrared signal from hightemperature structures such as jet engines and ship funnels could be significantly concealed by a composite material that reduces the radiation temperature of internally hot objects. Such \"infrared camouflaging\" is especially significant for military and civil applications, to reduce the threat from heatseeking missiles and evade thermal imaging systems. Researchers in China, led by Qiang Li at Zhejiang University, built their layered thermal camouflage from a silica aerogel and a germaniumzinc sulfide blend. The highly porous aerogel forms effective insulation. The germaniumzinc sulfide layers achieve radiative cooling by emitting energy at wavelengths outside the atmosphere's window. In tests on objects with an internal temperature of 600 C, the camouflage material reduced the surface temperature and the radiation temperature to 137 C and 37 C, respectively.", "authors": "Huanzheng Zhu; Qiang Li; Chunqi Zheng; Yu Hong; Ziquan Xu; Han Wang; Weidong Shen; Sandeep Kaur; Pintu Ghosh; Min Qiu", "keywords": "Midinfrared photonics; Nanophotonics and plasmonics", "organization_affiliated": "State Key Laboratory of Modern Optical Instrumentation, College of Optical Science and Engineering, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China; State Key Laboratory of Modern Optical Instrumentation, College of Optical Science and Engineering, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China; State Key Laboratory of Modern Optical Instrumentation, College of Optical Science and Engineering, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China; State Key Laboratory of Modern Optical Instrumentation, College of Optical Science and Engineering, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China; State Key Laboratory of Modern Optical Instrumentation, College of Optical Science and Engineering, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China; State Key Laboratory of Modern Optical Instrumentation, College of Optical Science and Engineering, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China; State Key Laboratory of Modern Optical Instrumentation, College of Optical Science and Engineering, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China; State Key Laboratory of Modern Optical Instrumentation, College of Optical Science and Engineering, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China; State Key Laboratory of Modern Optical Instrumentation, College of Optical Science and Engineering, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China; Key Laboratory of 3D MicroNano Fabrication and Characterization of Zhejiang Province, School of Engineering, Westlake University, Hangzhou, China; Institute of Advanced Technology, Westlake Institute for Advanced Study, Hangzhou, China"}

There is ample evidence for effective use of prior information during a variety of perceptual tasks, including the ability to recall locations using an egocentric (selfbased) frame. However, it is not yet known if people can use prior information effectively when using an allocentric (worldbased) frame. Fortyeight adults were shown sixty sets of three target locations in a sparse virtual environment with three beacons. The targets were drawn from one of four prior distributions. They were then asked to point to the targets after a delay and a change in perspective. While searches were biased towards the beacons, we did not find any evidence that participants successfully exploited the prior distributions of targets. These results suggest that allocentric reasoning does not conform to normative Bayesian models: we saw no evidence for use of priors in our cognitivelycomplex (allocentric) task, unlike in previous, simpler (egocentric) recall tasks.

The sudden drop in seawater salinity after a rainstorm was simulated, and subsequently differentially expressed metabolic markers were identified by LCMS nontargeted metabolomics. When the salinity dropped to 14 (S14), the total antioxidant content, activity of NaKATPase, superoxide dismutase (SOD), and catalase (CAT), content of malondialdehyde, and expression levels of MnSOD, CAT, and Ctype lectin of S. subcrenata were significantly higher than in groups with salinity of 22 (S22) or 30 (S30) (P  0.05). The activity of glutathione peroxidase (GPx), the content of reduced glutathione, and the expression levels of GPx were not significantly different between S14 and S22, but the values in each group were significantly higher than those in S30 (P  0.05). Using the metabolomics technique, 361, 271, and 264 metabolites with significant differences were identified from S22 vs. S14, S30 vs. S14, and S30 vs. S22, respectively.

Nonetheless, not all patients benefit equally and many issues remain unresolved, including the mechanisms of action and the possible effector function of immune cells from nonlymphoid lineages. The purpose of this study was to investigate whether antiPD1 immunotherapy acts on malignant tumor cells through mechanisms beyond those related to T lymphocyte involvement. We used a murine patientderived xenograft (PDX) model of earlystage nonsmall cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) devoid of host lymphoid cells, and studied the tumor and immune nonlymphoid responses to immunotherapy with antiPD1 alone or in combination with standard chemotherapy (cisplatin). An antitumor effect was observed in animals that received antiPD1 treatment, alone or in combination with cisplatin, likely due to a mechanism independent of T lymphocytes. Indeed, antiPD1 treatment induced myeloid cell mobilization to the tumor concomitant with the production of exudates compatible with an acute inflammatory reaction mediated by murine polymorphonuclear leukocytes, specifically neutrophils. Thus, while keeping in mind that more research is needed to corroborate our findings, we report preliminary evidence for a previously undescribed immunotherapy mechanism in this model, suggesting a potential cytotoxic action of neutrophils as PD1 inhibitor effector cells responsible for tumor regression by necrotic extension.", "authors": "Asuncion MartinRuiz; Carmen FiuzaLuces; Esther MartinezMartinez; Clemente F.

The biological basis of this is poorly understood but may include neurochemically mediated differences in the responsivity of key 'limbic' regions (including amygdala, ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) and nucleus accumbens (NAc)). Emerging evidence also suggests that ASD may be a disorder of brain temporal dynamics. Moreover, serotonin (5HT) has been shown to be a key regulator of both facialemotion processing and brain dynamics, and 5HT abnormalities have been consistently implicated in ASD. To date, however, no one has examined how 5HT influences the dynamics of facialemotion processing in ASD. Therefore, we compared the influence of 5HT on the responsivity of brain dynamics during facialemotion processing in individuals with and without ASD. Participants completed a facialemotion processing fMRI task at least 8 days apart using a randomised doubleblind crossover design. At each visit they received either a single 20mg oral dose of the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) citalopram or placebo. We found that citalopram (which increases levels of 5HT) caused sustained activation in key limbic regions during processing of negative facial emotions in adults with ASDbut not in neurotypical adults. The neurotypical adults' limbic response reverted more rapidly to baseline following a 5HTchallenge. Our results suggest that serotonergic homoeostatic control of the temporal dynamics in limbic regions is altered in adults with ASD, and provide a fresh perspective on the biology of ASD.", "authors": "Nichol M.

Several studies have now established that the hyperinflammatory response induced by SARSCoV2 is a major cause of disease severity and death in infected patients. Macrophages are a population of innate immune cells that sense and respond to microbial threats by producing inflammatory molecules that eliminate pathogens and promote tissue repair. However, a dysregulated macrophage response can be damaging to the host, as is seen in the macrophage activation syndrome induced by severe infections, including in infections with the related virus SARSCoV.

However, these models typically require biologically infeasible levels of labelled training data, so this similarity must at least arise via different paths. In addition, most popular CNNs are solely feedforward, lacking a notion of time and recurrence, whereas neurons in visual cortex produce complex timevarying responses, even to static inputs. Towards addressing these inconsistencies with biology, here we study the emergent properties of a recurrent generative network that is trained to predict future video frames in a selfsupervised manner. Remarkably, the resulting model is able to capture a wide variety of seemingly disparate phenomena observed in visual cortex, ranging from singleunit response dynamics to complex perceptual motion illusions, even when subjected to highly impoverished stimuli. These results suggest potentially deep connections between recurrent predictive neural network models and computations in the brain, providing new leads that can enrich both fields. The deep convolutional recurrent neural network 'PredNet' can be trained to predict future video frames in a selfsupervised manner.

Phagosomes from different stages of phagocytosis were isolated by densitygradient centrifugation, and more than 400 phagosomeassociated proteins were subsequently identified via highthroughput quantitative proteomics. In modeling key networks of phagosomal proteins, our results support the essential roles of several processes driving phagosome formation and maturation, including cytoskeleton remodeling and signal transduction by Rab proteins. Several endoplasmic reticulum (ER)associated proteins were identified, while live cell imaging confirms an apparent intimate interaction between the ER and phagosomes.

A definition of COPD was used based on the diagnosis code and medication. Frequent visitors were defined as subjects who visited the outpatient clinic for COPD three or more times per year. Among 159,025 subjects, 117,483 (73.9%) were classified as frequent visitors. Frequent visitors underwent pulmonary function tests and used various inhalers more often than did infrequent visitors. The rates of COPD exacerbation requiring admission to a general ward, emergency room, or intensive care unit were significantly lower in frequent visitors than in infrequent visitors. In multivariable analysis, frequent visits were identified as an independent factor preventing COPD exacerbation that required admission to a ward (odds ratio OR], 0.387), emergency room, (OR, 0.558), or intensive care unit (OR, 0.39) (all P  0.001).

The creatine transporter (CreaT, SLC6A8) belongs to the solute carrier 6 (SLC6) transporters family, and more particularly to the GABA transporters (GATs) subfamily. Understanding the molecular determinants of specificity within the SLC6 transporters in general, and the GATs in particular is very challenging due to the high similarity of these proteins. In the study presented here, our efforts focused on finding key structural features involved in binding selectivity for CreaT using structurebased computational methods. Due to the lack of threedimensional structures of SLC6A8, our approach was based on the realization of two reliable homology models of CreaT using the structures of two templates, i.e. the human serotonin transporter (hSERT) and the prokaryotic leucine transporter (LeuT). Our models reveal that an optimal complementarity between the shape of the binding site and the size of the ligands is necessary for transport.

For the oldest remains, the molecular study of these relationships is hindered by the degradation of ancient DNA. However, recent research has demonstrated that the analysis of ancient proteins can address this challenge68. Here we present the dental enamel proteomes of H. antecessor from Atapuerca (Spain)9,10 and Homo erectus from Dmanisi (Georgia)1, two key fossil assemblages that have a central role in models of Pleistocene hominin morphology, dispersal and divergence. We provide evidence that H. antecessor is a close sister lineage to subsequent Middle and Late Pleistocene hominins, including modern humans, Neanderthals and Denisovans. This placement implies that the modernlike face of H. antecessorthat is, similar to that of modern humansmay have a considerably deep ancestry in the genus Homo, and that the cranial morphology of Neanderthals represents a derived form. By recovering AMELYspecific peptide sequences, we also conclude that the H. antecessor molar fragment from Atapuerca that we analysed belonged to a male individual. Finally, these H. antecessor and H. erectus fossils preserve evidence of enamel proteome phosphorylation and proteolytic digestion that occurred in vivo during tooth formation. Our results provide important insights into the evolutionary relationships between H. antecessor and other hominin groups, and pave the way for future studies using enamel proteomes to investigate hominin biology across the existence of the genus Homo.

Although variations are often measured in population context, the basic carriers of variation are individuals. Hence, measuring variations such as SNP of an individual against a reference genome, which has been ignored previously, is certainly in its own right. Indeed, similar practice has been a tradition in community ecology, where the basic unit of diversity measure is individual community sample. We propose to use Renyi'sentropybased Hill numbers to define individuallevel genetic diversity and similarity and demonstrate the definitions with the SNP (single nucleotide polymorphism) datasets from the 1000Genomes Project. Hill numbers, derived from Renyi's entropy (of which Shannon's entropy is a special case), have found widely applications including measuring the quantum information entanglement and ecological diversity. The demonstrated individuallevel SNP diversity not only complements the existing populationlevel genetic diversity concepts, but also offers building blocks for comparative genetic analysis at higher levels. The concept of individual covers, but is not limited to, individual chromosome, region of chromosome, gene cluster(s), or whole genome.

Knowledge of the relationship between kidney dysfunction and impaired cognition may improve our understanding of other forms of cognitive dysfunction. Patients with CKD are at an increased risk (compared with the general population) of both dementia and its prodrome, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), which are characterized by deficits in executive functions, memory and attention. Brain imaging in patients with CKD has revealed damage to white matter in the prefrontal cortex and, in animal models, in the subcortical monoaminergic and cholinergic systems, accompanied by widespread macrovascular and microvascular damage. Unfortunately, current interventions that target cardiovascular risk factors (such as antihypertensive drugs, antiplatelet agents and statins) seem to have little or no effect on CKDassociated MCI, suggesting that the accumulation of uraemic neurotoxins may be more important than disturbed haemodynamic factors or lipid metabolism in MCI pathogenesis. Experimental models show that the brain monoaminergic system is susceptible to uraemic neurotoxins and that this system is responsible for the altered sleep pattern commonly observed in patients with CKD. Neural progenitor cells and the glymphatic system, which are important in Alzheimer disease pathogenesis, may also be involved in CKDassociated MCI. More detailed study of CKDassociated MCI is needed to fully understand its clinical relevance, underlying pathophysiology, possible means of early diagnosis and prevention, and whether there may be novel approaches and potential therapies with wider application to this and other forms of cognitive decline. Capasso and colleagues provide an overview of cognitive dysfunction resulting from CKD, including mild cognitive impairment and dementia.

Accordingly, for the first time, the current work utilized the photocatalytic degradation and the adsorption approach for Levofloxacin (LEVO) in pharmaceutical wastewater using new designed nano aspects. Therefore, spherical Zinc oxide nanoparticles (ZnONP) sized 17 nm and ultrathin sheetlike structure graphene oxide nanosheets (GONS) with layer thickness ~5 nm were fabricated separately or in a combination between them then characterized via Transmission Electron Microscope (TEM), Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM), XRay Diffraction (XRD), Fourier Transforms Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR), absorption spectra (UVVis) and BrunauerEmmettTeller (BET). Additionally, several parameters were investigated to evaluate the potential of the removal process, such as pH, the exposure time to UV radiation, the type and concentration of the nanoparticles (NPs) and the initial concentration of the drug using a mixed fractional factorial design. The most effective parameter for LEVO removal was the NPs type followed by the initial drug concentration. Furthermore, an RPHPLCUV method was developed and validated for measuring the percentage of removal for LEVO drug. The highest percentage removal for both 50 and 400 g mL1 LEVO was 99.2% and 99.6%, respectively, which was achieved using ZnONPGONS combination at pH 9  0.05 and UV light exposure time 120 min. In addition, the negative antibacterial activity of the treated wastewater sample confirmed the drug removal. The established protocol was successfully applied on wastewater samples collected from a pharmaceutical company that encouraged researchers to mainstream this design to be applied on other pharmaceutical wastewater drugs.", "authors": "Christine M.

There is a need for improved biomarkers for diagnosis and monitoring of this condition. Placental syncytiotrophoblasts at the maternalfetal interface release nanoparticles, including extracellular microvesicles, into the maternal blood during pregnancy. Syncytiotrophoblast extracellular microvesicles (STEVs) are being studied for their diagnostic potential and for their potential physiologic role in preeclampsia. We hypothesized that STEV profiles in maternal circulation would be altered under conditions of preeclampsia compared to normal pregnancy. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) released by BeWo cells in vitro showed high expression of syncytin1, but no plac1 expression, demonstrating that trophoblast cell EVs express syncytin1 on their surface. Placental alkaline phosphatase also showed high expression on BeWo EVs, but due to concern for cross reactivity to highly prevalent isoforms of intestinal and bone alkaline phosphatase, we utilized syncytin1 as a marker for STEVs. In vivo, syncytin1 protein expression was confirmed in maternal plasma EVs from Control and Preeclampsia subjects by Western blot, and overall, lower expression was noted in samples from patients with preeclampsia (n  8). By nanoparticle analysis, EV profiles from Control and Preeclampsia groups showed similar total plasma EV quantities (p  0.313) and size distribution (p  0.415), but STEV quantitative signal, marked by syncytin1 specific EVs, was significantly decreased in the Preeclampsia group (p  2.8  1011). Receiver operating characteristic curve demonstrated that STEV signal threshold cutoff of 0.316 was 95.2% sensitive and 95.6% specific for diagnosis of preeclampsia in this cohort (area under curve  0.975  0.020).

TLAK celloriginated protein kinase (TOPK), a serinethreonine kinase is activated by SUV irradiation and involved in skin carcinogenesis. Strategies with research focusing on the TOPK signaling pathway and targeted therapy in skin carcinogenesis may helpful for the discovery of additional treatments against skin cancer. In this study, we found that TOPK can directly bind to and phosphorylate cJun (as one of the core member of AP1) at Ser63 and Ser73 after SSL exposure in a JNKsindependent manner. TOPK knocking down, or HITOPK032 (TOPK specific inhibitor) attenuated colony formation and cell proliferation of skin cancer cells. Phosphorylated levels of cJun were overexpressed in human AK and cSCC compared with normal skin tissues, and HITOPK032 inhibited the phosphorylation of cJun in SCC cell line in a dosedependent manner. Furthermore, HITOPK032 decreased SSLinduced AP1 transactivation activity. Moreover, acute SSLinduced inflammation was attenuated by the topical application of HITOPK032 in SKH1 hairless mice. Importantly, HITOPK032 suppressed chronic SSLinduced skin carcinogenesis and cJun phosphorylation levels in SKH1 hairless mice. Our results demonstrate that TOPK can phosphorylate and activate cJun at Ser63 and Ser73 in the process of skin carcinogenesis and HITOPK032 could be used as a potential chemopreventive drug against cSCC development.", "authors": "Eunmiri Roh; Yaping Han; Kanamata Reddy; Tatyana A.

Although this process is irreversible, dietary modulation and caloric restriction are often considered to have antiaging effects. Dietary modulation can increase and maintain circulating ketone bodies, especially hydroxybutyrate (HB), which is one of the most abundant ketone bodies in human circulation. Increased HB has been reported to prevent or improve the symptoms of various ageassociated diseases. Indeed, numerous studies have reported that a ketogenic diet or ketone ester administration alleviates symptoms of neurodegenerative diseases, cardiovascular diseases, and cancers. Considering the potential of HB and the intriguing data emerging from in vivo and in vitro experiments as well as clinical trials, this therapeutic area is worthy of attention. In this review, we highlight studies that focus on the identified targets of HB and the cellular signals regulated by HB with respect to alleviation of ageassociated ailments. Boosting levels of a byproduct of fatty acid breakdown may help alleviate the symptoms of ageassociated health conditions. When the body is low on glucose, it breaks down fatty acids for energy, generating byproduct metabolites called ketones. The ketone hydroxybutyrate (HB) regulates cellular signaling and gene and protein expression. There are indications that ketogenic diets or ketone administration, which increase BH may prevent ageingassociated progression of illnesses like cardiovascular and neurodegenerative diseases and cancer. Youngmin Han and coworkers at Georgia State University in Atlanta, USA, reviewed current understanding of BH and its molecular targets. BH is a potent metabolite small enough to filter through cell membranes and circulate throughout the body, including the brain, influencing signaling pathways. Further investigations into associated molecular mechanisms will verify the metabolite's potential as a therapeutic agent.", "authors": "YoungMin Han; Tharmarajan Ramprasath; MingHui Zou", "keywords": "Mechanisms of disease; Translational research", "organization_affiliated": "Center for Molecular and Translational Medicine, Georgia State University, Atlanta, USA; Center for Molecular and Translational Medicine, Georgia State University, Atlanta, USA; Center for Molecular and Translational Medicine, Georgia State University, Atlanta, USA"}

Here, we evaluated effects of pregnancy, parturition, and obstetrical injury on FBLN5 content, elastic fibers, biomechanics, and histomorphology of the vaginal wall in rats. Further, we analyzed the effects of actinonin, a protease inhibitor, on obstetrical injury of the vaginal wall. Vaginal FBLN5 decreased significantly in pregnancy, and injury resulted in further downregulation. Stiffness of the vaginal wall decreased 82% in pregnant rats and 74% (p  0.019) with injury relative to uninjured vaginal delivery controls at 3d. Actinonin ameliorated loss of FBLN5, rescued injuryinduced loss of elastic fibers and biomechanical properties after parturition, and reduced the area of injury 10fold.

It is thus important to measure the full implications of environmental changes on the sustainability of aquaculture.

We calculate a MultiAntibiotic Resistance index (MAR) of aquaculturerelated bacteria (11,274 isolates) for 40 countries, of which mostly low and middleincome countries present high AMR levels. Here we show that aquaculture MAR indices correlate with MAR indices from human clinical bacteria, temperature and countries' climate vulnerability. We also find that infected aquatic animals present higher mortalities at warmer temperatures. Countries most vulnerable to climate change will probably face the highest AMR risks, impacting human health beyond the aquaculture sector, highlighting the need for urgent action. Sustainable solutions to minimise antibiotic use and increase system resilience are therefore needed. Global environmental changes threaten many foodproducing sectors, including aquaculture.

Simulations reveal the pivotal role of defects in the carbon surface in trapping and stabilizing the AuSAs at high temperatures, which well explain previous experimental observations.

Mimicking nature's route can be a direct and feasible way for synthetic organic chemists to construct complicated molecules. However, lacking nature's ability to manipulate enzymes often prevents us from reproducing the same route. Modifying nature's approaches can provide a simpler synthetic alternative to access complex structural target molecules. Here we report a strategy that simplifies the synthesis of terpenes by inverting the order of nature's twophase biosynthesis route. We first unite simple molecules into a polyfunctionalized linear polyenyne, with all the desired carbons and oxygens in the targeted places. This compound then undergoes polyenyne cycloisomerization, in the presence of all the functional groups, to give polyoxidized terpenes. The key reaction is a palladiumcatalysed polyenyne cycloisomerization that not only tolerates the presence of all of the oxygen functionalities, but also is facilitated by them. \n              \n                \n                  \n                \n              \n             Inverting the order of nature's twophase biosynthesis of terpenes offers a strategy by which the synthesis of these compounds can be simplified.

The soil CO2 flux is the sum of biotic respiration and abiotic geochemical CO2 exchange; however, little is known about abiotic CO2 fluxes in arid areas. To investigate the relative contribution of abiotic and biotic soil CO2 fluxes over a diurnal course, the abiotic CO2 flux was distinguished by autoclaving sterilization in both saline and alkaline soils at an arid site in northwestern China. The results demonstrated that: (1) Over the diurnal course, the abiotic CO2 was a significant component of the soil CO2 flux in both saline and alkaline soil, which accounted for more than 56% of the diurnal soil CO2 flux. (2) There was a dramatic difference in the temperature response between biotic and abiotic CO2 fluxes: the response curves of biotic respiration were exponential in the saline soil and quadratic in the alkaline soil, while the abiotic CO2 flux was linearly correlated with soil temperature. They were of similar magnitude but with opposite signs: resulting in almost neutral carbon emissions on daily average. (3) Due to this covering up effect of the abiotic CO2 flux, biotic respiration was severely underestimated (directly measured soil CO2 flux was only oneseventh of the biotic CO2 flux in saline soil, and even an order of magnitude lower in alkaline soil). In addition, the soil CO2 flux masked the temperatureinhibition of biotic respiration in the alkaline soil, and veiled the differences in soil biological respiration between the saline and alkaline soils. Hence, the soil CO2 flux may not be an ideal representative of soil respiration in arid soil. Our study calls for a reappraisal of the definition of the soil CO2 flux and its temperature dependence in arid or salinealkaline land. Further investigations of abiotic CO2 fluxes are needed to improve our understanding of arid land responses to global warming and to assist in identifying the underlying abiotic mechanisms.", "authors": "ZhongYuan Wang; JiangBo Xie; YuGang Wang; Yan Li", "keywords": "Carbon cycle; Geochemistry", "organization_affiliated": "State Key Laboratory of Subtropical Silviculture, Zhejiang AF University, Lin'an, China; State Key Laboratory of Subtropical Silviculture, Zhejiang AF University, Lin'an, China; State Key Laboratory of Desert and Oasis Ecology, Xinjiang Institute of Ecology and Geography, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Urumqi, China; Fukang Station of Desert Ecology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Fukang, China; State Key Laboratory of Subtropical Silviculture, Zhejiang AF University, Lin'an, China; State Key Laboratory of Desert and Oasis Ecology, Xinjiang Institute of Ecology and Geography, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Urumqi, China; Fukang Station of Desert Ecology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Fukang, China"}

Here, we developed starshaped particles, termed STAR particles, to dramatically increase skin permeability. STAR particles are millimeterscale particles made of aluminum oxide or stainless steel with micronscale projections designed to create microscopic pores across the stratum corneum. After gentle topical application for 10 s to porcine skin ex vivo, delivery of dermatological drugs and macromolecules, including those that cannot be given topically, was increased by 1 to 2 orders of magnitude. In mice treated with topical 5fluorouracil, use of STAR particles increased the efficacy of the drug in suppressing the growth of subcutaneous melanoma tumors and prolonging survival. Moreover, topical delivery of tetanus toxoid vaccine to mice using STAR particles generated immune responses that were at least as strong as delivery of the vaccine by intramuscular injection, albeit at a higher dose for topical than intramuscular vaccine administration. STAR particles were well tolerated and effective at creating micropores when applied to the skin of human participants. Use of STAR particles provides a simple, lowcost and welltolerated method for increasing drug and vaccine delivery to the skin and could widen the range of compounds that can be topically administered.

Furthermore, spatial adaptation of predictive saccades did not alter visually triggered reactive saccades, whereas adaptation of reactive saccades altered the metrics of predictive saccades. Our results suggest that the extrapolation of motion trajectory may be subject to spatial and temporal recalibration mechanisms located upstream from the site of reactive saccade adaptation.

However, in nonphysiological contexts (myopathies, atrophy, aging) FAPs cause fibrotic and fat infiltrations that impair muscle function. We set out to perform a fluorescence microscopybased screening to identify compounds that perturb the differentiation trajectories of these multipotent stem cells. From a primary screen of 1,120 FDAEMA approved drugs, we identified 34 compounds as potential inhibitors of adipogenic differentiation of FAPs isolated from the murine model (mdx) of Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). The hit list from this screen was surprisingly enriched with compounds from the glucocorticoid (GCs) chemical class, drugs that are known to promote adipogenesis in vitro and in vivo. To shed light on these data, three GCs identified in our screening efforts were characterized by different approaches. We found that like dexamethasone, budesonide inhibits adipogenesis induced by insulin in subconfluent FAPs. However, both drugs have a proadipogenic impact when the adipogenic mix contains factors that increase the concentration of cAMP. Gene expression analysis demonstrated that treatment with glucocorticoids induces the transcription of GilzTsc22d3, an inhibitor of the adipogenic master regulator PPAR, only in antiadipogenic conditions. Additionally, alongside their antiadipogenic effect, GCs are shown to promote terminal differentiation of satellite cells. Both the antiadipogenic and promyogenic effects are mediated by the glucocorticoid receptor and are not observed in the presence of receptor inhibitors. Steroid administration currently represents the standard treatment for DMD patients, the rationale being based on their antiinflammatory effects. The findings presented here offer new insights on additional glucocorticoid effects on muscle stem cells that may affect muscle homeostasis and physiology.", "authors": "Andrea Cerquone Perpetuini; Giulio Giuliani; Alessio Reggio; Mauro Cerretani; Marisabella Santoriello; Roberta Stefanelli; Alessandro Palma; Simone Vumbaca; Steven Harper; Luisa Castagnoli; Alberto Bresciani; Gianni Cesareni", "keywords": "Muscle stem cells; Stemcell differentiation; Target identification", "organization_affiliated": "Department of Biology, University of Rome \"Tor Vergata\", Rome, Italy; Department of Biology, University of Rome \"Tor Vergata\", Rome, Italy; Department of Biology, University of Rome \"Tor Vergata\", Rome, Italy; Department of Biology, IRBM S.p.A., via Pontina Km 30,600, Pomezia (Roma), Italy; Department of Biology, IRBM S.p.A., via Pontina Km 30,600, Pomezia (Roma), Italy; Department of Biology, University of Rome \"Tor Vergata\", Rome, Italy; Department of Biology, University of Rome \"Tor Vergata\", Rome, Italy; Department of Biology, University of Rome \"Tor Vergata\", Rome, Italy; Department of Biology, IRBM S.p.A., via Pontina Km 30,600, Pomezia (Roma), Italy; Department of Biology, University of Rome \"Tor Vergata\", Rome, Italy; Department of Biology, IRBM S.p.A., via Pontina Km 30,600, Pomezia (Roma), Italy; Department of Biology, University of Rome \"Tor Vergata\", Rome, Italy; Fondazione Santa Lucia Istituto di Ricovero e Cura a Carattere Scientifico (IRCCS), Rome, Italy"}

They are VolmerWeber (VW: island formation) mode and StranskiKrastanov (SK: layerplusisland) mode. Since both growth modes end up in the formation of threedimensional (3D) islands, fabrication of single crystalline films on latticemismatched substrates has been challenging. Here, we demonstrate another growth mode, where a buffer layer consisting of 3D islands initially forms and a relaxed twodimensional (2D) layer subsequently grows on the buffer layer. This 3D2D mode transition has been realized using impurities. We observed the 3D2D mode transition for the case of ZnO film growth on 18%latticemismatched sapphire substrates. First, nanosized 3D islands grow with the help of nitrogen impurities. Then, the islands coalesce to form a 2D layer after cessation of the nitrogen supply, whereupon an increase in the surface energy may provide a driving force for the coalescence. Finally, the films grow in 2D mode, forming atomically flat terraces.

A pot experiment was conducted to verify the fertilizer efficiency of coated diammonium phosphate (CDAP) with maize. The results showed that polishing with 2% water reduced the angle of repose by 2.4810.57% and specific surface area by 5.7048.76%, making it more suitable for coating. The nutrient release period of CDAP was significantly prolonged by 5.36 times. Soil available phosphorous, enzyme activities, maize grain yield, and phosphorous use efficiency were all improved through the blending application of coated and normal phosphate fertilizer. This study demonstrated that waterbased surface modification is a lowcost and effective method for improvement and promotion of controlled release P fertilizers.", "authors": "Hao Lu; Hongyu Tian; Min Zhang; Zhiguang Liu; Qi Chen; Rui Guan; Huaili Wang", "keywords": "Chemical engineering; Chemical physics", "organization_affiliated": "National Engineering Laboratory for Efficient Utilization of Soil and Fertilizer Resources, National Engineering and Technology Research Center for Slow and Controlled Release Fertilizers, College of Resources and Environment, Shandong Agricultural University, Taian, China; State Key Laboratory of Nutrition Resources Integrated Utilization, Kingenta Ecological Engineering Group Co., Ltd., Linshu, China; National Engineering Laboratory for Efficient Utilization of Soil and Fertilizer Resources, National Engineering and Technology Research Center for Slow and Controlled Release Fertilizers, College of Resources and Environment, Shandong Agricultural University, Taian, China; National Engineering Laboratory for Efficient Utilization of Soil and Fertilizer Resources, National Engineering and Technology Research Center for Slow and Controlled Release Fertilizers, College of Resources and Environment, Shandong Agricultural University, Taian, China; State Key Laboratory of Nutrition Resources Integrated Utilization, Kingenta Ecological Engineering Group Co., Ltd., Linshu, China; National Engineering Laboratory for Efficient Utilization of Soil and Fertilizer Resources, National Engineering and Technology Research Center for Slow and Controlled Release Fertilizers, College of Resources and Environment, Shandong Agricultural University, Taian, China; State Key Laboratory of Nutrition Resources Integrated Utilization, Kingenta Ecological Engineering Group Co., Ltd., Linshu, China; National Engineering Laboratory for Efficient Utilization of Soil and Fertilizer Resources, National Engineering and Technology Research Center for Slow and Controlled Release Fertilizers, College of Resources and Environment, Shandong Agricultural University, Taian, China; National Engineering Laboratory for Efficient Utilization of Soil and Fertilizer Resources, National Engineering and Technology Research Center for Slow and Controlled Release Fertilizers, College of Resources and Environment, Shandong Agricultural University, Taian, China; State Key Laboratory of Nutrition Resources Integrated Utilization, Kingenta Ecological Engineering Group Co., Ltd., Linshu, China"}

When the generated spin current is injected to a ferromagnet, it produces spinorbit torque and manipulates magnetization efficiently. Optically generated spin currents are expected to be superior to their electrical counterparts in terms of the manipulation speed. Here we report optical spinorbit torques in heavy metalferromagnet heterostructures. The strong spinorbit coupling of heavy metals induces photoexcited carriers to be spinpolarized, and their transport from heavy metals to ferromagnets induces a torque on magnetization. Our results demonstrate that heavy metals can generate spinorbit torque not only electrically but also optically. It is known that torques can be exerted on spins in a ferromagnet (FM) layer when an inplane electric current is injected into a heavy metal (HM) layer in contact with the FM layer. Here, the authors demonstrate that torques can be generated without the current injection by shining instead circularly polarized light on the HM.", "authors": "GyungMin Choi; Jung Hyun Oh; DongKyu Lee; SeoWon Lee; Kun Woo Kim; Mijin Lim; ByoungChul Min; KyungJin Lee; HyunWoo Lee", "keywords": "Ferromagnetism; Magnetooptics; Spintronics", "organization_affiliated": "Department of Energy Science, Sungkyunkwan University, Suwon, Korea; Center for Integrated Nanostructure Physics, Institute for Basic Science (IBS), Suwon, Korea; Center for Spintronics, Korea Institute of Science and Technology, Seoul, Korea; Department of Materials Science and Engineering, Korea University, Seoul, Korea; Department of Materials Science and Engineering, Korea University, Seoul, Korea; Department of Materials Science and Engineering, Korea University, Seoul, Korea; Center for Theoretical Physics of Complex Systems, Institute for Basic Science (IBS), Daejeon, Korea; Department of Physics, Pohang University of Science and Technology, Pohang, Korea; Center for Spintronics, Korea Institute of Science and Technology, Seoul, Korea; Department of Materials Science and Engineering, Korea University, Seoul, Korea; KUKIST Graduate School of Converging Science and Technology, Korea University, Seoul, Korea; Department of Physics, Pohang University of Science and Technology, Pohang, Korea"}

Treatment typically involves the surgical implantation of a pressureregulated silicone tube assembly, known as a shunt. Unfortunately, shunts have extremely high failure rates and diagnosing shunt malfunction is challenging due to a combination of vague symptoms and a lack of a convenient means to monitor flow. Here, we introduce a wireless, wearable device that enables precise measurements of CSF flow, continuously or intermittently, in hospitals, laboratories or even in home settings. The technology exploits measurements of thermal transport through nearsurface layers of skin to assess flow, with a soft, flexible, and skinconformal device that can be constructed using commercially available components. Systematic benchtop studies and numerical simulations highlight all of the key considerations. Measurements on 7 patients establish high levels of functionality, with data that reveal time dependent changes in flow associated with positional and inertial effects on the body. Taken together, the results suggest a significant advance in monitoring capabilities for patients with shunted hydrocephalus, with potential for practical use across a range of settings and circumstances, and additional utility for research purposes in studies of CSF hydrodynamics.", "authors": "Siddharth R.

To a lesser extent, these projections also contributed to opioidinduced place preference, suggesting a role in signaling positive valence as well, and thus a lack of dedicated polarity. Manipulations of VTA terminal activity were more effective in females and paralleled by sex differences in glutamatergic signaling. By prioritizing retrieval of negative and positive over neutral memories, the VTADH circuit can facilitate the selection of adaptive behaviors when current and past experiences are valence congruent.

In teeth, neural crestderived mesenchymal cells expressed PDGF receptors migrate and become condensed toward invaginated epithelium. To identify the molecular mechanism of this interaction, we explored the specific transcriptional start sites (TSSs) of tooth organs using cap analysis of gene expression (CAGE). We identified a tooth specific TSS detected in the chromosome 15qD1 region, which codes microRNA875 (mir875). MiR8755p is specifically expressed in dental mesenchyme during the early stage of tooth development. Furthermore, PRRX12 binds to the mir875 promoter region and enhances the expression of mir875. To assess the role of miR8755p in dental mesenchyme, we transfected mimic miR8755p into mouse dental pulp (mDP) cells, which showed that cell migration toward dental epithelial cells was significantly induced by miR8755p via the PDGF signaling pathway. Those results also demonstrated that miR8755p induces cell migration by inhibiting PTEN and STAT1, which are regulated by miR8755p as part of posttranscriptional regulation.

In the case of dicalcium phosphates, ever since brushite (CaHPO42H2O, dicalcium phosphate dihydrate, DCPD) and monetite (CaHPO4, dicalcium phosphate, DCP) were first described in 19th century, the form with intermediary chemical formula CaHPO4H2O (dicalcium phosphate monohydrate, DCPM) has remained elusive. Here, we report the synthesis and crystal structure determination of DCPM. This form of CaP is found to crystallize from amorphous calcium hydrogen phosphate (ACHP) in waterpoor environments. The crystal structure of DCPM is determined to show a layered structure with a monoclinic symmetry. DCPM is metastable in water, but can be stabilized by organics, and has a higher alkalinity than DCP and DCPD. This study serves as an inspiration for the future exploration of DCPM's potential role in biomineralization, or biomedical applications. Understanding the crystal structure of different calcium phosphates is important for a range of different subjects from geology to biomedicine.

We solve this oldstanding fundamental problem by developing an approach which combines the perturbation expansion of the microscopic theory with statistical simulations and which requires no prior assumption on the vortex distribution. Our study offers the most complete picture of the interchange of the superconductivity types available so far. The mixed state in this regime reveals a rich manifold of exotic configurations, which reproduce available experimental results. Our work introduces a pattern formation mechanism that originates from the selfduality of the theory that is universal and not sensitive to the microscopic details. Classification into type I and II reflects different responses of a superconductor to an applied magnetic field, however, there are intertype materials with unique properties and atypical vortex configurations. The authors study vortex patterns in this regime revealing that their properties are governed by a universal material independent mechanism, which amends the dual classification.", "authors": "A.

Dynamic axondendritic positioning can restrict synaptogenic encounters, but the spatiotemporal interaction kinetics and their regulation remain essentially unknown inside developing brains. Here we show that the kinetics of axonal filopodia restrict synapse formation and partner choice for neurons that are not otherwise prevented from making incorrect synapses. Using 4D imaging in developing Drosophila brains, we show that filopodial kinetics are regulated by autophagy, a prevalent degradation mechanism whose role in brain development remains poorly understood. With surprising specificity, autophagosomes form in synaptogenic filopodia, followed by filopodial collapse. Altered autophagic degradation of synaptic building material quantitatively regulates synapse formation as shown by computational modeling and genetic experiments. Increased filopodial stability enables incorrect synaptic partnerships. Hence, filopodial autophagy restricts inappropriate partner choice through a process of kinetic exclusion that critically contributes to wiring specificity. The molecular mechanisms that restrict synapse formation with incorrect partners remain unclear.

Previous records have hinted at a partitioning of deep ocean ventilation across the two major intervals of atmospheric CO2 rise, but the consequences of differential ventilation on the Si cycle has not been explored. Here we present three new records of silicon isotopes in diatoms and sponges from the Southern Ocean that together show increased Si supply from deep mixing during the deglaciation with a maximum during the Younger Dryas (YD). We suggest Antarctic sea ice and Atlantic overturning conditions favoured abyssal ocean ventilation at the YD and marked an interval of Si cycle reorganisation. By regulating the strength of the biological pump, the glacialinterglacial shift in the Si cycle may present an important control on Pleistocene CO2 concentrations. Global atmospheric CO2 varies between glacialinterglacial cycles.

We tested the monocular and binocular contrast sensitivity of nystagmus and normally sighted subjects by measuring contrast detection of a Gabor target with spatial frequencies slightly above the cutoff threshold of each subject (nystagmus ~3; controls  9cpd; presentation times 60480 ms). The dominant eye of nystagmus revealed large differences over the nondominant eye, highlighting the superiority of the dominant over the nondominant eye in nystagmus. In addition, binocular summation mechanism was impaired in majority of the nystagmus subjects. Furthermore, these differences are not attributed to differences in visual acuity. Moreover, the visual performance in nystagmus continue to improve for longer presentation time compared with controls and was longer in the poor eye.

To disentangle whether this involves distinct modes of deposition or unique functions once incorporated into chromatin, we combined studies in Xenopus early development with chromatin assays. Here we investigate the extent to which H3.3 mutated at residues that differ from H3.2 rescue developmental defects caused by H3.3 depletion. Regardless of the deposition pathway, only variants at residue 31a serine that can become phosphorylatedfailed to rescue endogenous H3.3 depletion. Although an alanine substitution fails to rescue H3.3 depletion, a phosphomimic aspartate residue at position 31 rescues H3.3 function. To explore mechanisms involving H3.3 S31 phosphorylation, we identified factors attracted or repulsed by the presence of aspartate at position 31, along with modifications on neighboring residues. We propose that serine 31phosphorylated H3.3 acts as a signaling module that stimulates the acetylation of K27, providing a chromatin state permissive to the embryonic development program. Replicative and nonreplicative H3 variants have different cell cycle regulation and incorporation modes.

Treatment with doxycycline for 5 days resulted in a decrease of mitochondrialencoded proteins, respiration and membrane potential, and an increase of reactive oxygen species in A549 cells and fibroblasts, but fibroblasts were less affected. Doxycycline slowed proliferation of A549 cells by 35%. Cellular ATP levels did not change. Doxycycline alone had no effect on apoptosis; however, in combination with gemcitabine given during the last 2 days of treatment, doxycycline increased caspase 9 and 37 activities, resulting in a further decrease of surviving A549 cells by 59% and of fibroblasts by 24% compared to gemcitabine treatment alone.

The rapid increase of global temperatures highlights the need for a clear assessment of how sex ratios of organisms with TSD are affected. In turtles with TSD, quantifying primary sex ratios is challenging because they lack external dimorphism and heteromorphic sex chromosomes. Here we describe a new technique used to identify sex in neonate turtles of two TSD species, a freshwater turtle (Trachemys scripta) and a marine turtle (Caretta caretta) via analysis of small blood samples. We used an immunoassay approach to test samples for the presence of several proteins known to play an important role in sex differentiation. Our results show that AntiMullerian Hormone (AMH) can be reliably detected in blood samples from neonate male turtles but not females and can be used as a sexspecific marker. Verification of sex via histology or laparoscopy revealed that this method was 100% reliable for identifying sex in both T. scripta and C. caretta 12 dayold hatchlings and 90% reliable for identifying sex in 83177 dayold (120160 g) loggerhead juveniles.

In this work we present a new method, for which we coin term desulfurization, for creating green emitting ZnO with significantly enhanced quantum efficiency.

Here, we present the modulation of exposed crystal facets as a feasible approach to enhance specific nanocrystalbiomolecule associations for improving cellular targeting and nanomaterial uptake. We demonstrate that facetengineering significantly enhances transferrin binding to cadmium chalcogenide nanocrystals and their subsequent delivery into cancer cells, mediated by transferrin receptors, in a complex biological matrix. Competitive adsorption experiments coupled with theoretical calculations reveal that the (100) facet of cadmoselite and (002) facet of greenockite preferentially bind with transferrin via innersphere thiol complexation. Molecular dynamics simulation infers that facetdependent transferrin binding is also induced by the differential affinity of crystal facets to water molecules in the first solvation shell, which affects access to exposed facets. Overall, this research underlines the promise of facet engineering to improve the efficacy of crystalline nanomaterials in biological applications.

These PSexposing EVs are prothrombotic and proinflammatory and are found at elevated levels in many cardiovascular and metabolic diseases. How PSexposing EVs are shed is not fully understood. A clearer understanding of this process may aid the development of drugs to selectively block their release. In this study we report that 2aminoethoxydiphenylborate (2APB) significantly inhibits the release of PSexposing EVs from platelets stimulated with the Ca2 ionophore, A23187, or the poreforming toxin, streptolysinO. Two analogues of 2APB, diphenylboronic anhydride (DPBA) and 3(diphenylphosphino)1propylamine (DP3A), inhibited PSexposing EV release with similar potency. Although 2APB and DPBA weakly inhibited platelet PS exposure and calpain activity, this was not seen with DP3A despite inhibiting PSexposing EV release. These data suggest that there is a further target of 2APB, independent of cytosolic Ca2 signalling, PS exposure and calpain activity, that is required for PSexposing EV release. DP3A is likely to inhibit the same target, without these other effects. Identifying the target of 2APB, DPBA and DP3A may provide a new way to inhibit PSexposing EV release from activated platelets and inhibit their contribution to thrombosis and inflammation.", "authors": "Hao Wei; Jessica E.

On a practical level, monochromatic TMDbased emitters would be beneficial for lowdimensional devices, but this challenge is yet to be resolved. Here, we show that graphene, directly stacked onto TMD monolayers, enables single and narrowline photoluminescence arising solely from TMD neutral excitons. This filtering effect stems from complete neutralization of the TMD by graphene, combined with selective nonradiative transfer of longlived excitonic species to graphene. Our approach is applied to four tungsten and molybdenumbased TMDs and establishes TMDgraphene heterostructures as a unique set of optoelectronic building blocks that are suitable for electroluminescent systems emitting visible and nearinfrared photons at near THz rate with linewidths approaching the homogeneous limit.

Using haploid genetic screens we identify the SREBP Regulating Gene (SPRINGC12ORF49) as a determinant of the SREBP pathway. SPRING is a glycosylated Golgiresident membrane protein and its ablation in Hap1 cells, Hepa16 hepatoma cells, and primary murine hepatocytes reduces SREBP signaling. In mice, Spring deletion is embryonic lethal yet silencing of hepatic Spring expression also attenuates the SREBP response. Mechanistically, attenuated SREBP signaling in SPRINGKO cells results from reduced SREBP cleavageactivating protein (SCAP) and its mislocalization to the Golgi irrespective of the cellular sterol status. Consistent with limited functional SCAP in SPRINGKO cells, reintroducing SCAP restores SREBPdependent signaling and function. Moreover, in line with the role of SREBP in tumor growth, a wide range of tumor cell lines display dependency on SPRING expression. In conclusion, we identify SPRING as a previously unrecognized modulator of SREBP signaling. The transcription factor SREBP is a wellstudied and major regulator of sterol and fatty acid metabolism. Here, the authors used haploid genetic screens to identify the Golgiresident protein SPRING as a new modulator of SREBP by regulating the level of functional SREBP cleavageactivating protein (SCAP).", "authors": "Anke Loregger; Matthijs Raaben; Joppe Nieuwenhuis; Josephine M.

TEM and SEM analysis demonstrated the successful use of GO's peroxidaselike and carbocatalytic properties to produce GOAg nanocomposite. UVVis analysis indicated a higher yield in optical density values for GOAg nanocomposites created using GO's carbocatalytic ability rather than its peroxidaselike counterpart.

A D3R gene variant, Ser9Gly (rs6280) has been linked to nicotine dependence, yet the mechanisms underlying its involvement in nicotine dependence is unclear. This study investigated the relationship between the Ser9Gly variant and measures of both nicotine reinforcement and cueelicited craving. Phenotypes of smoking behaviors were assessed in genetically grouped (Glycine vs. No Glycine carriers) current smokers (n  104,  10 cigarettes per day). Laboratory measures included a forced choice session (to measure reinforcement of nicotine containing vs. denicotinized cigarettes), and a cuereactivity session (to measure smoking cues vs. neutral cues elicited craving). The forced choice procedure revealed that subjective ratings were significantly higher in response to nicotinized compared to denicotinized cigarettes; however the Ser9Gly variant did not influence this effect. By comparison, smoking cues elicited greater craving over time compared to neutral cues, and Glycine carriers of the Ser9Gly D3R variant seem to experience a significant blunted cueelicited craving effect.

To this end, samples were electrochemically charged with the hydrogen isotope deuterium (2H, D) and analysed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) and timeofflight secondary ion mass spectrometry (ToFSIMS). It was found that deuterium caused a phase transformation from the original  austenite into  and 'martensite. Despite their low solubility for hydrogen, viz. deuterium, the newly formed phases showed high deuterium concentration which was attributed to the increased density of traps. Information about the behaviour of deuterium in the material subjected to external mechanical load was gathered. A fourpointbending device was developed for this purpose. This allowed to analyse insitu precharged samples in the ToFSIMS during the application of external mechanical load.

However, individual cells' signaling responses to proinflammatory cues are heterogeneous, with subpopulations emerging with high or low activation states. Here, we use singlecell tracking and dynamical modeling to develop and validate a revised model for lipopolysaccharide (LPS)induced macrophage activation that invokes a mechanism we term quorum licensing. The results show that bimodal phenotypic partitioning of macrophages is primed during the resting state, dependent on cumulative history of cell density, predicted by extrinsic noise in transcription factor expression, and independent of canonical LPSinduced intercellular feedback in the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) response. Our analysis shows how this densitydependent coupling produces a nonlinear effect on collective TNF production. We speculate that by linking macrophage density to activation, this mechanism could amplify local responses to threats and prevent false alarms. Macrophage activation is tightly regulated to maintain immune homeostasis, yet activation is also heterogeneous.

Thus, chemicals that can affect thyroid hormone signaling during pregnancy are of great concern. Perfluorohexane sulfonate (PFHxS) is a widespread environmental contaminant found in human serum, breastmilk, and other tissues, capable of lowering serum thyroxine (T4) in rats. Here, we investigated its effects on the thyroid system and neurodevelopment following maternal exposure from early gestation through lactation (0.05, 5 or 25 mgkgday PFHxS), alone or in combination with a mixture of 12 environmentally relevant endocrine disrupting compounds (EDmix). PFHxS lowered thyroid hormone levels in both dams and offspring in a dosedependent manner, but did not change TSH levels, weight, histology, or expression of marker genes of the thyroid gland. No evidence of thyroid hormonemediated neurobehavioral disruption in offspring was observed. Since human brain development appear very sensitive to low T4 levels, we maintain that PFHxS is of potential concern to human health.

Variation in most transcripts appears (nearly) neutral or under very weak stabilizing selection in wet paddy conditions (with median standardized selection differentials near zero), but selection is stronger under drought conditions. Overall, more transcripts are conditionally neutral (2.83%) than are antagonistically pleiotropic6 (0.04%), and transcripts that display lower levels of expression and stochastic noise79 and higher levels of plasticity9 are under stronger selection. Selection strength was further weakly negatively associated with levels of cisregulation and network connectivity9.

However, systematic characterisation of speed representation is still lacking. In this study, we compared the speed representation of distinct cell types across subregionslayers in the dorsal hippocampus and medial entorhinal cortex of rats during exploration. Our results indicate that the preferred theta phases of individual neurons are correlated with positivenegative speed modulation and a temporal shift of speed representation in a subregionlayer and cell typedependent manner. Most speed cells located in entorhinal cortex layer 2 represented speed prospectively, whereas those in the CA1 and entorhinal cortex layers 3 and 5 represented speed retrospectively. In entorhinal cortex layer 2, putative CA1projecting pyramidal cells, but not putative dentate gyrusCA3projecting stellate cells, represented speed prospectively. Among the hippocampal interneurons, approximately onethird of putative dendritetargeting (somatostatinexpressing) interneurons, but only a negligible fraction of putative somatargeting (parvalbuminexpressing) interneurons, showed negative speed modulation. Putative parvalbuminexpressing CA1 interneurons and somatostatinexpressing CA3 interneurons represented speed more retrospectively than parvalbuminexpressing CA3 interneurons.

The main components in fluid inclusions, i.e. H2O and CO2, correspond to the decomposed products of organic acids, which lead us to consider that in the mineralization process the organic acids transport and then discharge metals when they are stable and unstable, respectively. Here we show that the thermal stability of copper acetate solution at 15350 C (0.1830 MPa) provides insight as to the role of organic acids in metal transport. Results show that the copper acetate solution is stable at high PT conditions under low geothermal gradient of 19 Ckm, with an isochore of P  1.89 T  128.58, verifying the possibility of copper transportation as acetate solution. Increasing geothermal gradient leads to thermal dissociation of copper acetate in the way of 4Cu(CH3 COO)2  2H2O  4Cu  2CO2  7CH3COOH. The experimental results and inferences in this contribution agree well with the frequently observed fluid inclusions and wallrock alterations of carbonate, sericite and quartz in hydrothermal deposits, and provide a new dimension in the understanding of the role of CO2 during mineralization.", "authors": "Zhiyong Ni; Yanjing Chen; Haifei Zheng; Nuo Li; Heping Li", "keywords": "Geochemistry; Geology", "organization_affiliated": "State Key Laboratory of Petroleum Resources and Prospecting, China University of Petroleum, Beijing, China; College of Geosciences, China University of Petroleum, Beijing, China; Key Laboratory of Orogen and Crustal Evolution, Peking University, Beijing, China; Xinjiang Research Center for Mineral Resources, Xinjiang Institute of Ecology and Geography, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Urumqi, China; Key Laboratory of Orogen and Crustal Evolution, Peking University, Beijing, China; Xinjiang Research Center for Mineral Resources, Xinjiang Institute of Ecology and Geography, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Urumqi, China; Institut fur Mineralogie, Leibniz Universitat Hannover, Hannover, Germany; Institute of geochemistry, Chinese academy of sciences, Guiyang, China"}

This trend has been followed by an abandonment of agricultural and livestock practices, which has provided an opportunity for rewilding to take place. Rewilding processes can modify the availability of carrion resources for avian obligate scavengers and reduce accessible open areas due to the increase of shrub and forest. We examined how changes in landscape configuration in the past five decades (19562011) mediate the foraging behaviour of griffon vultures. Particularly, we examined whether vultures use those areas under natural succession and with a high availability of wild ungulate carcasses. We used GPS information yielded by 30 adult griffon vultures exploiting large regions of southern Spain. We determined (a) habitat use considering land uses and food availability and (b) how tracked individuals responded to areas in different stages of rewilding. Our results showed that vultures preferentially used Mediterranean scrublands, woodlands and the agroforest Mediterranean ecosystem called dehesa, as well as areas with high food resources, namely wild ungulates in winter and a mixture of wild ungulates and livestock in summer. Due to a higher abundance of wild ungulates, vultures forage preferentially in areas with low levels of rewilding, either for being in the first stages of natural succession or for not having experienced further rewilding since the middle of the last century. Rewilding processes are expected to continue in the future affecting the scavenger guild structure and function deeply. Improved management will be essential to preserve ecological processes, ecosystem services and populations of endangered species.", "authors": "P. MartinDiaz; A. CortesAvizanda; D. Serrano; E.

In this light, spintronic devices are promising because of the inherent nonlinearity of magnetization dynamics. Here, we demonstrate experimentally the potential for chaosbased schemes using nanocontact vortex oscillators by unveiling and characterizing their waveform patterns and symbolic dynamics using timeresolved electrical measurements. We dissociate nonlinear deterministic patterns from thermal fluctuations and show that the emergence of chaos results in the unpredictable alternation of welldefined patterns. With phasespace reconstruction techniques, we perform symbolic analyses of the time series and show that the oscillator exhibits maximal entropy and complexity at the centre of its incommensurate region. This suggests that such vortexbased systems are promising nanoscale sources of entropy that could be exploited for information processing. Controlling chaotic behavior in spintronic devices is promising for signalprocessing applications.

MCL1 degradation involves its interaction with one of its key binding partners, the proapoptotic BH3only protein NOXA. Here, we report that the mitochondriaassociated E3ligase MARCH5, best known for its role in mitochondrial quality control and regulation of components of the mitochondrial fission machinery, controls the levels of MCL1NOXA protein complexes in steady state as well as during mitotic arrest. Inhibition of MARCH5 function sensitizes cancer cells to the proapoptotic effects of MTAs by the accumulation of NOXA and primes cancer cells that may undergo slippage to escape death in mitosis to cell death in the next G1 phase.

We find scaling relations in the delay suffered by both event participants and other citizens doing their usual traveling in the background. The delay is a function of the number of participants and the event location. The model is solved analytically in lattices proving the existence of scaling relations and the connection of their exponents to the local dimension. Thereafter, extensive and systematic simulations in eight worldwide cities reveal that a newly proposed measure of local dimension explains the exponents found in the network recovery.

Furthermore, we showed that targeting the exons present downstream of the exons with a start codon or distant from ATG is relatively effective for eliminating mutant mRNAs in vivo, whereas the exons with a start codon are targeted to express the mutant mRNAs. Of the sixteen mutant mice generated, only four mutant mice targeting the downstream exons exhibited over 80% clearance of mutant mRNAs.

The current study shows that activated Cdc42 was rapidly recruited to the migrating CRC cell front after VEGF stimulation through engagement of membraneanchored neuropilin1 (NRP1). When VEGF signalling was blocked with NRP1 knockdown or ATWLPPR (A7R, antagonist of VEGFNRP1 interaction), Cdc42 activation and relocation to the cell front was attenuated, and filopodia and invadopodia formation was inhibited. The VEGFNRP1 axis regulates directional migration, invasion, and metastasis through Cdc42 activation and relocation resulting from actin filament polymerisation of the extensions of membrane protrusions.

Our previous study found that atypical protein kinase C (aPKC) promoted the EMT process in HCC. However, how the aPKC signaling pathway is regulated in HCC has not been elucidated. In this study, vector transfection was utilized to study the invasion of HCC cells, and the mechanism between P300 and aPKC signaling pathways in regulating the EMT process of HCC was further elucidated in vitro and in vivo. We found both P300 and aPKC were highly expressed in HCC and they were correlated with tumor progression and poor survival in HCC patients. P300 knockdown inhibited EMT, invasion and other malignant events of HCC cells but promoted cell apoptosis and cycle arrest. However, the effects mediated by P300 knockdown were abolished by aPKC overexpression. Further studies showed that P300 upregulates aPKC expression through increasing the transcription of Elk1, a transcriptional activator of aPKC, and stabilizing Elk1 protein and its phosphorylation. In conclusion, our work uncovered the molecular mechanism by which oncogenic aPKC is upregulated in HCC and suggests that P300, like aPKC, may be used as a prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target in patients with HCC.", "authors": "Chaoqun Ma; Shuhong Huang; Lei Xu; Li Tian; Yan Yang; Jianming Wang", "keywords": "Cancer genetics; Cell signalling; Liver cancer; Metastasis; Oncogenes", "organization_affiliated": "Department of Biliary and Pancreatic SurgeryCancer Research Center, Affiliated Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China; Institute of Basic Medicine, Shandong Academy of Medical Sciences, Jinan, China; Department of Biliary and Pancreatic SurgeryCancer Research Center, Affiliated Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China; Department of Biliary and Pancreatic SurgeryCancer Research Center, Affiliated Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China; Department of Hepatopancreatobiliary Surgery, The First Affiliated Hospital, Hainan Medical University, Haikou, China; Department of Biliary and Pancreatic SurgeryCancer Research Center, Affiliated Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China; Department of Hepatobiliary Pancreatic Surgery, Affiliated Tianyou Hospital, Wuhan University of Science  Technology, Wuhan, China"}

This study aimed to elucidate the role of IL8 in the therapeutic effects of hUCBCs in a mouse model of hypoxicischaemic brain injury (HI). In P7 HI mouse brains, hUCBC administration at day 7 after HI upregulated the gene expression of Cxcl2, the mouse IL8 homologue and increased the expression of its receptor, CXCR2. hUCBC administration restored the sequential downstream signalling axis of pp38pMAPKAPK2, NFB, and angiogenic factors, which were downregulated by HI. An in vitro assay revealed the downregulation of the angiogenic pathway by CXCR2 knockdown and p38 inhibition. In vivo p38 inhibition prior to hUCBC administration in HI mouse brains produced identical results. Behavioural outcomes revealed a therapeutic effect (ps  0.01) of hUCBC or IL8 administration, which was correlated with decreases in infarct size and angiogenic findings in the striatum. In conclusion, the response of the host to hUCBC administration in mice upregulated Cxcl2, which led to the activation of the IL8mediated pp38 signalling pathway. The upregulation of the downstream pathway and angiogenic growth factors via NFB can be inferred to be the potential therapeutic mechanism of hUCBCs.", "authors": "Kye Hee Cho; Jee In Choi; JinOck Kim; Joo Eun Jung; DongWook Kim; MinYoung Kim", "keywords": "Medical research; Stemcell research", "organization_affiliated": "Department of Rehabilitation Medicine, CHA Gumi Medical Center, CHA University College of Medicine, Gumi, Republic of Korea; Rehabilitation and Regeneration Research Center, CHA University, Seongnam, Republic of Korea; College of Pharmacy, Ajou University, Suwon, Republic of Korea; Department of Neurology, University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston, McGovern Medical School, Houston, USA; Department of Physiology, Yonsei University College of Medicine, Seoul, Republic of Korea; Rehabilitation and Regeneration Research Center, CHA University, Seongnam, Republic of Korea; Department of Rehabilitation Medicine, CHA Bundang Medical Center, CHA University College of Medicine, Seongnam, Republic of Korea"}

The performances of carbon materials in such applications can be improved by adjusting their physical properties, especially their nanostructures. The determination of the carbon nanostructure is thus considerably important. Reverse Monte Carlo and hybrid reverse Monte Carlo simulations, which are used to analyze the diffraction patterns of carbon materials, can be used to obtain nanostructure images. Here, we describe a new approach to carbon nanostructure investigation, namely, hybrid reverse molecular dynamics (HRMD) simulation. This approach has the advantage that all of the carbon atoms move toward probable carbon structures by force fields to adapt a simulated diffraction pattern to an experimental one, in contrast to the random movements in reverse Monte Carlo and hybrid reverse Monte Carlo simulations.

Specifically, we show how hydrostatic stresses in the matrix can be used as a metric to explain and predict the exact location of microvoid nucleation that occurs during damage initiation within the composite's microstructure. Furthermore, this work provides evidence that hydrostatic stresses in the matrix can lead to coupled microvoid nucleation and early fiber breakage, and that small fragments of fibers can play an important role in the process of microvoid nucleation. These results significantly improve our understanding of the mechanics that drive the initiation of damage in the complex microstructures of discontinuous fiber reinforced thermoplastics, while also allowing scientists and engineers to predict the microstructural damage behavior of these composites at subfiber resolution and with high accuracy.", "authors": "Imad Hanhan; Ronald F.

Our findings show that large networks can either be robust to variations of their weights and parameters, or efficient in responding to external stimuli, processing noise, or transmitting information across long distances.

Here, we tested whether dynein, a minusenddirected microtubule (MT) motor2, can harness energy from these fluctuations using optical trapping in vitro. We show that dynein forms an asymmetric slip bond with MTs, where its detachment rate increases more slowly under hindering forces than assisting forces. This asymmetry enables dynein to generate unidirectional motility towards the minusend from force fluctuations. Consistent with our model, oscillatory forces exerted by the trap drive dynein stepping without net force and ATP. Dynein is capable of ratcheting towards the minusend, even when the net force is in the plusend direction. With ATP, force oscillations increase the velocity and stall force of dynein as it transports cargos and glides MTs. Therefore, dynein is a mechanical ratchet that rectifies cytoskeletal fluctuations to move faster and resists higher forces along MTs. The motor protein dynein is associated with microtubule force generation in the cell; how it interacts with cytoskeletal fluctuations is still an open question.

In clinical practice, GMs are visually assessed by qualified licensees; however, this presents a difficulty in terms of quantitative evaluation. Various measurement systems for the quantitative evaluation of GMs track target markers attached to infants; however, these markers may disturb infants' spontaneous movements. This paper proposes a markerless movement measurement and evaluation system for GMs in infants. The proposed system calculates 25 indices related to GMs, including the magnitude and rhythm of movements, by video analysis, that is, by calculating background subtractions and frame differences. Movement classification is performed based on the clinical definition of GMs by using an artificial neural network with a stochastic structure. This supports the assessment of GMs and early diagnoses of disabilities in infants. In a series of experiments, the proposed system is applied to movement evaluation and classification in fullterm infants and lowbirthweight infants. The experimental results confirm that the average agreement between four GMs classified by the proposed system and those identified by a licensee reaches up to 83.1  1.84%.

A strong secondorder effect that is naturally inhibited in silicon can also be observed, for example, by electrically breaking the inversion symmetry and quasiphase matching the pump and the signal. To generate an efficient broadband secondharmonic signal, however, the most promising technique requires matching the group velocities of the pump and the signal. In this work, we utilize dispersion engineering of a silicon waveguide to achieve group velocity matching between the pump and the signal, along with an additional degree of freedom to broaden the second harmonic through the strong thirdorder nonlinearity. We demonstrate that the strong selfphase modulation and crossphase modulation in silicon help broaden the second harmonic by 200 nm in the Oband. Furthermore, we show a waveguide design that can be used to generate a secondharmonic signal in the entire nearinfrared region. Our work paves the way for various applications, such as efficient and broadband complementarymetal oxide semiconductor based onchip frequency synthesizers, entangled photon pair generators, and optical parametric oscillators. Advances in silicon engineering now allow waveguides to deliver frequency doubled light across the entire nearinfrared spectrum, an important range for biological imaging and optical communication. Secondharmonic generation, which is normally restricted in silicon because of its underlying crystal symmetry, can be observed by applying strong electric field in silicon, however, the spectral response remains quite narrow to a few nanometers. Neetesh Singh from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, in Cambridge, United States, and colleagues report a very broadband response of 100s of nanometers using silicon waveguides containing rows of diode junctions. When an electric field is applied to the waveguide, the diodes disrupt the typical silicon symmetry and enable secondharmonic generation from a pump laser. Modifying the cross section of the waveguide to ensure that pump and signal pulses travel though the waveguide at similar velocities enabled generation of frequency doubled light with a broader bandwidth than seen with current silicon or any other material based microstructures.", "authors": "Neetesh Singh; Manan Raval; Alfonso Ruocco; Michael R.

If the observable commutes with the system Hamiltonian, repeated measurements yield the same result and thus minimally disturb the system. Seminal quantum optics experiments have achieved such quantum nondemolition (QND) measurements of systems with few degrees of freedom. In contrast, here we describe how the QND measurement of a complex manybody observable, the Hamiltonian of an interacting manybody system, can be implemented in a trappedion analog quantum simulator. Through a singleshot measurement, the manybody system is prepared in a narrow band of (highly excited) energy eigenstates, and potentially even a single eigenstate. Our QND scheme, which can be carried over to other platforms of quantum simulation, provides a framework to investigate experimentally fundamental aspects of equilibrium and nonequilibrium statistical physics including the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis and quantum fluctuation relations. The theoretical understanding of quantum manybody systems often involves properties of energy eigenstates but these are difficult to probe experimentally.

A significant SB was observed for all MELD and DQI subgroups, with the exception of high MELD patients transplanted with \"highrisk\" grafts. More specifically, in decompensatedcirrhosis patients, \"highrisk\" grafts did not appear to be detrimental in medium MELD patients. Interestingly, in hepatocellularcarcinoma (HCC) patients, a significant SB was found for all MELDDQI combinations. For MELD exceptions no SB was found. In terms of SB, \"lowrisk\" grafts appeared appropriate for most severe patients (MELD  30). Conversely, lowmedium MELD and HCC patients presented an SB while allocated \"highrisk\" grafts.

Here we investigate the involvement of microRNAs in this process. MicroRNA expression profiles were determined from a series of archival, paired samples of plexiform neurofibroma and MPNST. Ninety differentially expressed microRNAs were identified between the paired samples. Three downregulated microRNAs (let7b5p, miR1433p, miR1455p) and two upregulated microRNAs (miR135b5p and miR8893p) in MPNST were selected for functional characterization. In general, their differential expression was validated in a relevant cell line panel but only partly in a series of unpaired, fresh frozen tumor samples. As part of the validation process we also analyzed microRNA expression profiles of sporadic MPNSTs observing that microRNA expression discriminates NF1associated and sporadic MPNSTs. The role of microRNAs in cancer progression was examined in NF1derived MPNST cell lines by transiently modulating microRNA levels. Our findings indicate that some microRNAs affect migratory and invasive capabilities and Wnt signaling activity but the effects are distinct in different cell lines.

Plant species endemic to the Andes are well adapted to the harsh features of highaltitude climate, including high UV radiation. Maca (Lepidium meyenii Walpers) is a member of Brassicaceae family native to the central Andes of Peru, which grows between 3500 and 4500 m of altitude, where only highland grasses and few hardy bushes can survive. Even though maca has been the focus of recent researches, mainly due to its nutraceutical properties, knowledge regarding its adaptation mechanisms to these particular natural environmental conditions is scarce. In this study, we manipulated solar UV radiation by using UVtransmitting (Control) or blocking (UVblock) filters under field conditions (4138 m above the sea level) in order to understand the impact of UV on morphological and physiological parameters of maca crops over a complete growing season. Compared to the UVblocking filter, under control condition a significant increase of hypocotyl weight was observed during the vegetative phase together with a marked leaf turnover. Although parameters conferring photosynthetic performance were not altered by UV, carbohydrate allocation between above and underground organs was affected. Control condition did not influence the content of secondary metabolites such as glucosinolates and phenolic compounds in hypocotyls, while some differences were observed in the rosettes. These differences were mainly related to leaf turnover and the protection of new young leaves in control plants. Altogether, the data suggest that maca plants respond to strong UV radiation at high altitudes by a coordinated remobilization and relocation of metabolites between source and sink organs via a possible UV signaling pathway.", "authors": "Thais Huarancca Reyes; Eliana Esparza; Gaia Crestani; Fabian Limonchi; Rudi Cruz; Norma Salinas; Andrea Scartazza; Lorenzo Guglielminetti; Eric Cosio", "keywords": "Abiotic; Plant physiology", "organization_affiliated": "Department of Agriculture, Food and Environment, University of Pisa, Pisa, Italy; Seccion Quimica, Pontificia Universidad Catolica del Peru, San Miguel, Peru; Department of Agriculture, Food and Environment, University of Pisa, Pisa, Italy; Seccion Quimica, Pontificia Universidad Catolica del Peru, San Miguel, Peru; Seccion Quimica, Pontificia Universidad Catolica del Peru, San Miguel, Peru; Seccion Quimica, Pontificia Universidad Catolica del Peru, San Miguel, Peru; Institute of Research on Terrestrial Ecosystems, National Research Council, Pisa, Italy; Department of Agriculture, Food and Environment, University of Pisa, Pisa, Italy; Interdepartmental Research Center \"Nutraceuticals and Food for Health\", University of Pisa, Pisa, Italy; Seccion Quimica, Pontificia Universidad Catolica del Peru, San Miguel, Peru"}

Here, we propose that interactions with other people can influence motor decisionmaking and improve riskseeking bias. We developed a competitive reaching game (a variant of the \"chicken game\") in which aiming for greater rewards increased the risk of no reward and subjects competed for the total reward with their opponent. The game resembles situations in sports, such as a penalty kick in soccer, service in tennis, the strike zone in baseball, or takeoff in ski jumping. In five different experiments, we demonstrated that, at the beginning of the competitive game, the subjects robustly switched their riskseeking strategy to a riskaverse strategy. Following the reversal of the strategy, the subjects achieved optimal decisionmaking when competing with riskaverse opponents. This optimality was achieved by a nonlinear influence of an opponent's decisions on a subject's decisions.

The antenna quenching component qH is a sustained form of energy dissipation that protects the photosynthetic apparatus under stress conditions. This photoprotective mechanism requires the plastid lipocalin LCNP and is prevented by SUPPRESSOR OF QUENCHING1 (SOQ1) under nonstress conditions. However, the molecular mechanism of qH relaxation has yet to be resolved. Here, we isolated and characterized RELAXATION OF QH1 (ROQH1), an atypical shortchain dehydrogenasereductase that functions as a qHrelaxation factor in Arabidopsis. The ROQH1 gene belongs to the GreenCut2 inventory specific to photosynthetic organisms, and the ROQH1 protein localizes to the chloroplast stroma lamellae membrane. After a cold and highlight treatment, qH does not relax in roqh1 mutants and qH does not occur in leaves overexpressing ROQH1. When the soq1 and roqh1 mutations are combined, qH can neither be prevented nor relaxed and soq1 roqh1 displays constitutive qH and lightlimited growth. We propose that LCNP and ROQH1 perform dosagedependent, antagonistic functions to protect the photosynthetic apparatus and maintain lightharvesting efficiency in plants.

Cefazolin, a safe, firstgeneration cephalosporin antibiotic, has been recently shown to specifically interact with interleukin 15 (IL15) receptor subunit  (IL15R) and to inhibit IL15dependent TNF and IL17 synthesis. The aim of this study was to elucidate cefazolin activity against IL2, IL4, IL15 and IL21, i.e. four cytokines sharing the common cytokine receptor  chain (c). In silico, molecular docking unveiled two potential cefazolin binding sites within the IL2IL15R subunit and two within the c subunit. In vitro, cefazolin decreased proliferation of PBMC (peripheral blood mononuclear cells) following IL2, IL4 and IL15 stimulation, reduced production of IFN, IL17 and TNF in IL2 and IL15treated PBMC and in IL15 stimulated natural killer (NK) cells, attenuated IL4dependent expression of CD11c in monocytederived dendritic cells and suppressed phosphorylation of JAK3 in response to IL2 and IL15 in PBMC, to IL4 in TF1 (erythroleukemic cell line) and to IL21 in NK92 (NK cell line). The results of the study suggest that cefazolin may exert inhibitory activity against all of the c receptordependent cytokines, i.e. IL2, IL4, IL7, IL9, IL15 and IL21.", "authors": "Barbara ZyzynskaGranica; Bartosz Trzaskowski; Magorzata Dutkiewicz; Oliwia ZegrockaStendel; Maja Machcinska; Katarzyna Bocian; Magdalena Kowalewska; Katarzyna Koziak", "keywords": "Pharmaceutics; Psoriasis", "organization_affiliated": "Department of Pharmacodynamics, Centre for Preclinical Research and Technologies, Medical University of Warsaw, Banacha 1b, Warsaw, Poland; Chair and Department of Biochemistry, Medical University of Warsaw, Banacha 1, Warsaw, Poland; University of Warsaw, Centre of New Technologies, Banacha 2c, Warsaw, Poland; Department of Immunology, Biochemistry and Nutrition, Centre for Preclinical Research and Technologies, Medical University of Warsaw, Banacha 1b, Warsaw, Poland; Department of Immunology, Biochemistry and Nutrition, Centre for Preclinical Research and Technologies, Medical University of Warsaw, Banacha 1b, Warsaw, Poland; Laboratory of Parasitology, Military Institute of Hygiene and Epidemiology, Kozielska 4, Warsaw, Poland; Department of Immunology, Faculty of Biology, University of Warsaw, Miecznikowa 1, Warsaw, Poland; Department of Immunology, Faculty of Biology, University of Warsaw, Miecznikowa 1, Warsaw, Poland; Department of Immunology, Biochemistry and Nutrition, Centre for Preclinical Research and Technologies, Medical University of Warsaw, Banacha 1b, Warsaw, Poland; Department of Molecular and Translational Oncology, Maria SklodowskaCurie Institute  Oncology Centre, Roentgena 5, Warsaw, Poland; Department of Immunology, Biochemistry and Nutrition, Centre for Preclinical Research and Technologies, Medical University of Warsaw, Banacha 1b, Warsaw, Poland"}

Typically, such an approach rarely results in the identification of functional variants implicating a defined gene in the disease process. We now performed a transcriptomewide association study (TWAS) allowing the prediction of effects of AMDassociated genetic variants on gene expression. The TWAS was based on the genotypes of 16,144 latestage AMD cases and 17,832 healthy controls, and gene expression was imputed for 27 different human tissues which were obtained from 134 to 421 individuals. A linear regression model including each individuals imputed gene expression data and the respective AMD status identified 106 genes significantly associated to AMD variants in at least one tissue (Qvalue  0.001). Gene enrichment analysis highlighted rather systemic than tissue or cellspecific processes. Remarkably, 31 of the 106 genes overlapped with significant GWAS signals of other complex traits and diseases, such as neurological or autoimmune conditions. Taken together, our study highlights the fact that expression of genes associated with AMD is not restricted to retinal tissue as could be expected for an eye disease of the posterior pole, but instead is rather ubiquitous suggesting processes underlying AMD pathology to be of systemic nature.", "authors": "Tobias Strunz; Susette Lauwen; Christina Kiel; Anneke den Hollander; Bernhard H.

However, to date, there is still no appropriate technology for the labelfree, realtime and highthroughput monitoring of endothelial function. To this end, we developed an optical biosensorbased endothelial labelfree biochip (EnLaB) assay that meets all the above requirements. Using our EnLaB platform, we screened a set of plasma serine proteases as possible endothelial cell activators, and first identified the endothelial cell activating function of three important serine proteases  namely kallikrein, C1r and mannanbinding lectinassociated serineprotease 2 (MASP2)  and verified these results in wellestablished functional assays.

They are emerging as a new category of messengers that facilitate crosstalk between cells, tissues, and organs. Thus, a critical demand arises for the development of a sensitive and noninvasive tracking system for endogenous exosomes. We have generated a genetic mouse model that meets this goal. The Nanoluciferase (NanoLuc) reporter was fused with the exosome surface marker CD63 for exosome labeling. The cardiomyocytespecific MHC promoter followed by the loxPSTOPloxP cassette was engineered for temporal and spatial labeling of exosomes originated from cardiomyocytes. The transgenic mouse was bred with a tamoxifeninducible Cre mouse (Rosa26CreERT2) to achieve inducible expression of CD63NanoLuc reporter. The specific labeling and tissue distribution of endogenous exosomes released from cardiomyocytes were demonstrated by luciferase assay and noninvasive bioluminescent live imaging. This endogenous exosome tracking mouse provides a useful tool for a range of research applications. Using nanoluciferaseCD63, Weijia Luo et al. develop transgenic mice where cardiac exosomes can be tracked with noninvasive bioluminescent live imaging in a tamoxifeninducible manner.

It represents a way in which social interactions can immediately and potently modulate behavior. As such, social buffering is one mechanism by which strong social support increases resilience to mental illness. Although the behavioral and neuroendocrine impacts of social buffering are well studied in multiple species, including humans, the neuronal underpinnings of this behavioral phenomenon remain largely unexplored. Previous work has shown that the infralimbic prefrontal cortex (ILPFC) is important for processing social information and, in separate studies, for modulating fear and anxiety. Thus, we hypothesized that socially active cells within the ILPFC may integrate social information to modulate fear responsivity. To test this hypothesis, we employed social buffering paradigms in male and female mice. Similar to prior studies in rats, we found that the presence of a cagemate reduced freezing in fear and anxietyprovoking contexts. In accordance with previous work, we demonstrated that interaction with a novel or familiar conspecific induces activity in the ILPFC as evidenced by increased immediate early gene (IEG) expression. We then utilized an activitydependent tagging murine line, the ArcCreERT2 mice, to express channelrhodopsin (ChR2) in neurons active during the social encoding of a new cagemate. We found that optogenetic reactivation of these socially active neuronal ensembles phenocopied the effects of cagemate presence in male and female mice in learned and innate fear contexts without being inherently rewarding or altering locomotion. These data suggest that a social neural ensemble within the ILPFC may contribute to social buffering of fear. These neurons may represent a novel therapeutic target for fear and anxiety disorders.", "authors": "Vanessa A. Gutzeit; Kylia Ahuna; Tabia L. Santos; Ashley M.

In vivo interrogation of chromatin architecture and genomewide RALYbinding pattern reveal insights into its cooperative interactions and mode of action in regulating cholesterogenesis. Interestingly, we find that RALY binds the promoter region of the master metabolic regulator Srebp2 and show that it directly interacts with coactivator Nuclear Transcription Factor Y (NFY) to influence cholesterogenic gene expression.

Nextgeneration sequencing is the only effective technology to deal with the high genetic heterogeneity of ASD in a clinical setting. However, rigorous criteria to classify rare genetic variants conferring ASD susceptibility are currently lacking. We have performed wholeexome sequencing to identify both nucleotide variants and copy number variants (CNVs) in 253 ASD patients, including 68 patients with intellectual disability (ID) and 90 diagnosed as Asperger syndrome. Using explicit criteria to classify both susceptibility genes and susceptibility variants we prioritized 217 genes belonging to the following categories: syndromic genes, genes with an excess of de novo protein truncating variants and genes targeted by rare CNVs. We obtained a susceptibility variant detection rate of 19.7% (95% CI: 1525.2%]). The rate for CNVs was 7.1% (95% CI: 4.311%]) and 12.6% (95% CI: 8.817.4%]) for nucleotide variants. The highest rate (30.1%, 95% CI: 20.243.2%]) was obtained in the ASD  ID subgroup. A strong contributor for at risk nucleotide variants was the recently identified set of genes (n  81) harboring an excess of de novo protein truncating variants. Since there is currently no evidence that the genes targeted here are necessary and sufficient to cause ASD, we recommend to avoid the term \"causative of ASD\" when delivering the information about a variant to a family and to use instead the term \"genetic susceptibility factor contributing to ASD\".", "authors": "Thomas Husson;

We employed two highquality databases with known pregnancy outcomes (n  221). We created a system consisting of different classifiers that is feed with novel morphometric features extracted from the digital micrographs, along with other nonmorphometric data to predict pregnancy. It was evaluated using five different classifiers: probabilistic bayesian, Support Vector Machines (SVM), deep neural network, decision tree, and Random Forest (RF), using a kfold cross validation to assess the model's generalization capabilities. In the database A, the SVM classifier achieved an F1 score of 0.74, and AUC of 0.77. In the database B the RF classifier obtained a F1 score of 0.71, and AUC of 0.75.

These new data demonstrate that there is wide spread evidence of faulting that reaches the sea floor in the western Taiwan Strait, clearly indicating that the Benhai fault is active. Faults that cut up section from steep basin sidewalls to form flower structures or terraced sidewall fault zones, together with the fault and basin map pattern, are consistent with this fault zone being in the early developmental stages of a dextral strikeslip system.

Considering worksafety regulations, we will identify immanent noise patterns during major visceral surgeries. Increased levels of noise are known to have negative health impacts. Based on a very finegrained data collection over a year, this study will introduce a new procedure for visual representation of intrasurgery noise progression and pave new paths for future research on noise reduction in visceral surgery. Digital decibel soundlevel meters were used to record the total noise in three operating theatres in onesecond cycles over a year. These data were matched to archival data on surgery characteristics. Because surgeries inherently vary in length, we developed a new procedure to normalize surgery times to run crosssurgery comparisons. Based on this procedure, dBA values were adjusted to each normalized time point. Noiselevel patterns are presented for surgeries contingent on important surgery characteristics: 16 different surgery types, operation method, daynight time point and operation complexity (complexity levels 13). This serves to cover a wide spectrum of daytoday surgeries. The noise patterns reveal significant sound level differences of about 1 dBA, with the mostcommon noise level being spread between 55 and 60 dBA. This indicates a sound situation in many of the surgeries studied likely to cause stress in patients and staff. Absolute and relative risks of meeting or exceeding 60 dBA differ considerably across operation types. In conclusion, the study reveals that maximum noise levels of 55 dBA are frequently exceeded during visceral surgical procedures. Especially complex surgeries show, on average, a higher noise exposure. Our findings warrant active noise management for visceral surgery to reduce potential negative impacts of noise on surgical performance and outcome.", "authors": "C. T. Baltin; H. Wilhelm; M.

Solutionphase deposition provides a scalable approach to the creation of metalTMD hybrid systems, but controlling such processes remains challenging. Here we elucidate the different pathways by which gold and silver deposit at room temperature onto colloidal 1TWS2, 2HWS2, 2HMoSe2, 2HWSe2, 1TMoTe2 and TdWTe2 fewlayer nanostructures to produce several distinct classes of 0D2D and 2D2D metalTMD hybrids. Uniform gold nanoparticles form on all of the TMDs. By contrast, silver deposits as nanoparticles with a bimodal size distribution on the disulfides and diselenides, and as atomically thin layers on the ditellurides. The various sizes and morphologies of these surfacebound metal species arise from the relative strengths of the interfacial metalchalcogen bonds during the reduction of Au3 or Ag by the TMDs. The deposition of noble metals onto twodimensional transition metal dichalcogenides is crucial for practical applications, including in catalysis and sensing, yet this process has remained difficult to control. Now, gold and silver have been shown to grow on colloidal transition metal dichalcogenide nanosheets into either atomically thin layers or nanoparticles whose sizes and morphologies depend on the relative strengths of the interfacial noble metalchalcogen bonds.", "authors": "Yifan Sun; Yuanxi Wang; Jamie Y.

Surveillance of the burden due to MiP based on routinely collected data at a finescale level, followed by an appropriate analysis and interpretation, may be crucial for evaluating and improving the effectiveness of existing control measures. We described the spatiotemporal dynamics of MiP at the communitylevel and assessed health program effects, mainly communitybased health promotion, resultsbased financing, and intermittentpreventivetreatment with sulphadoxinepyrimethamine (IPTpSP). Communityaggregated monthly MiP cases were downloaded from Health Management Information System and combined with covariates from other sources. The MiP spatiotemporal pattern was decomposed into three components: overall spatial and temporal trends and spacetime interaction. Bayesian hierarchical spatiotemporal Poisson models were used to fit the MiP incidence rate and assess health program effects. The overall annual incidence increased between 2015 and 2017. The findings reveal spatiotemporal heterogenicity throughout the year, which peaked during rainy season. From the model without covariates, 96 communities located mainly in the Cascades, SouthWest, CenterWest, CenterEast, and Eastern regions, exhibited significant relativerisk levels. The combined effect (significant reducing effect) of RBF, health promotion and IPTpSP strategies was greatest in 17.7% (1796) of high burden malaria communities.

In this work, we propose a facile and effective passivation method to enhance the photochemical stability of QDs using polymeric double shell structures from thiolterminated poly(methyl methacrylatebglycidyl methacrylate) (P(MMAbGMA)SH) block copolymer ligands. To generate a densely crosslinked network, the crosslinking reaction of GMA epoxides in the PGMA block was conducted using a Lewis acid catalyst under an ambient environment to avoid affecting the photophysical properties of the pristine QDs. This provides QDs encapsulated with robust double layers consisting of highly transparent PMMA outershell and oxidationprotective crosslinked inner shell. Consequently, the resulting QDs exhibited exceptional tolerance to heat and oxidants when dispersed in organic solvents or QDnanocomposite films, as demonstrated under various harsh conditions with respect to temperature and oxidant species. The present approach not only provides simple yet effective chemical means to enhance the thermochemical stability of QDs, but also offers a promising platform for the hybridization of QDs with polymeric materials for developing robust lightemitting or lightharvesting devices. A treatment that makes nanoparticles robust and thus more useful for optoelectronics has been developed by researchers in South Korea. Quantum dots are semiconductor particles just a few tens of nanometers in diameter. These tiny dimensions restrict the motion of electrons, which gives the dots properties similar to those of an atom. Specifically, they efficiently absorb and emit spectrally pure light, making them useful for displays, photodetectors and solar cells. However, quantum dots are sensitive to heat, moisture and oxidization. Joona Bang, Korea University, Seoul, and colleagues improved the thermochemical stability of quantum dots by surrounding them with a physical barrier to suppress the creation of surface defects. This protective shell was made using a crosslinkable polymer ligand and was shown to reduce the deleterious effects of exposure to high temperatures and an oxidizing agent. Quantum Dot: Shell crosslinking endows stability: Simple and facile crosslinking chemistry was employed to form the robust network shell on the quantum dot (QD) surface without altering the photoluminescence property of pristine QDs. The resulting shell crosslinked QDs exhibited exceptional tolerance against heat or chemical oxidations. And the exterior brush in QDs can be readily tunable and provide the miscibility with host polymer matrix, resulting in welldefined QDnanocomposite films. This encapsulation strategy can be generally applicable to many other nanoparticles that are vulnerable to various external stimuli. \n                \n                  \n                    \n                  \n                \n              ", "authors": "Jaewan Ko; Byeong Guk Jeong; Jun Hyuk Chang; Joonyoung F.

The aluminium groundplane with thickness of 3 m is sandwiched between the twolayers. Concentric dielectricrings are etched in the groundplane under the radiation patches implemented on the toplayer. The radiation patches comprise concentric metalrings that are arranged in a 3  3 matrix. The antennas are excited by coupling electromagnetic energy through the gaps of the concentric dielectricrings in the groundplane using a microstrip feedline created on the bottom polyimidelayer. The openended feedline is split in threebranches that are aligned under the radiation elements to couple the maximum energy. In this structure, the concentric metalrings essentially act as series lefthanded capacitances CL that extend the effective aperture area of the antenna without affecting its dimensions, and the concentric dielectric rings etched in the groundplane act as shunt lefthanded inductors LL, which suppress the surfacewaves and reduce the substrates losses that leads to improved bandwidth and radiation properties. The overall structure behaves like a metasurface that is shown to exhibit a very large bandwidth of 0.3500.385 THz with an average radiation gain and efficiency of 8.15dBi and 65.71%, respectively.

Diversity of AMF increases plant community productivity and plant diversity. For decades, it was known that plants trade carbohydrates for phosphate with their fungal symbionts. However, recent studies show that plantderived lipids probably represent the most essential currency of exchange. Understanding the regulation of plant genes involved in the currency of exchange is crucial to understanding stability of this mutualism. Plants encounter many different AMF genotypes that vary greatly in the benefit they confer to plants. Yet the role that fungal genetic variation plays in the regulation of this currency has not received much attention. We used a highresolution phylogeny of one AMF species (Rhizophagus irregularis) to show that fungal genetic variation drives the regulation of the plant fatty acid pathway in cassava (Manihot esculenta); a pathway regulating one of the essential currencies of trade in the symbiosis. The regulation of this pathway was explained by clearly defined patterns of fungal genomewide variation representing the precise fungal evolutionary history. This represents the first demonstrated link between the genetics of AMF and reprogramming of an essential plant pathway regulating the currency of exchange in the symbiosis. The transcription factor RAM1 was also revealed as the dominant gene in the fatty acid plant gene coexpression network. Our study highlights the crucial role of variation in fungal genomes in the trade of resources in this important symbiosis and also opens the door to discovering characteristics of AMF genomes responsible for interactions between AMF and cassava that will lead to optimal cassava growth.", "authors": "Romain Savary; Cindy Dupuis; Frederic G.

We examined if the functional benefit of tracing is overcoming the poor sensitivity or low spatial resolution at the back of the tongue or alternatively compensating for limited information processing capacity by fixating on a segment of the spatial pattern at a time. Using a commercially available SSD, the BrainPort, we compared letter recognition performance in three presentation modes; tracing, static, and drawing. Stimulation intensity was either constant or increased from the tip to the back of the tongue to partially compensate for the decreasing sensitivity. Recognition was significantly better for tracing, compared to static and drawing conditions. Confusion analyses showed that letters were confused based on their characteristics presented near the tip in static and drawing conditions. The results suggest that recognition performance is limited by the poor spatial resolution at the back of the tongue, and tracing seems to be an effective strategy to overcome this. Compensating for limited information processing capacity or poor sensitivity by drawing or increasing intensity at the back, respectively, does not improve the performance.", "authors": "Zahide Pamir; M.

We have generated a mouse model of this condition by replacing the wild type gene with one encoding Kcnt1R455H, a cytoplasmic Cterminal mutation homologous to a human R474H variant that results in EIMFS. We compared behavior patterns and seizure activity in these mice with those of wild type mice and Kcnt1 mice. Complete loss of Kcnt1 produced deficits in open field behavior and motor skill learning. Although their thresholds for electrically and chemically induced seizures were similar to those of wild type animals, Kcnt1 mice were significantly protected from death after maximum electroshockinduced seizures. In contrast, homozygous Kcnt1R455HR455H mice were embryonic lethal. VideoEEG monitoring of heterozygous Kcnt1R455H animals revealed persistent interictal spikes, spontaneous seizures and a substantially decreased threshold for pentylenetetrazoleinduced seizures. Surprisingly, Kcnt1R455H mice were not impaired in tasks of exploratory behavior or procedural motor learning.

In this study, we present the results of a large scale metaanalysis of heart failure GWAS and replication in a comparable sized cohort to identify one known and two novel loci associated with heart failure.

Functional characterization and finemapping of that locus reveal a putative causal variant in a cardiac muscle specific regulatory region activated during cardiomyocyte differentiation that binds to the ACTN2 gene, a crucial structural protein inside the cardiac sarcolemma (HiC interaction pvalue  0.00002). Genomeediting in human embryonic stem cellderived cardiomyocytes confirms the influence of the identified regulatory region in the expression of ACTN2.

Here, we extend metabolic scaling theory and use global simulation models to demonstrate that (i) megabiota are more prone to extinction due to human land use, hunting, and climate change; (ii) loss of megabiota has a negative impact on ecosystem metabolism and functioning; and (iii) their reduction has and will continue to significantly decrease biosphere functioning.

We anticipate that they could be utilized to induce asymmetric photopolymerization reactions with high enantioselectivity and reactivity. Here, we report such a system. By employing silver nanoparticles modified with cysteine as the chiral inducer, polydiacetylene (PDA) with high chiral asymmetry was obtained from achiral diacetylene monomers triggered with unpolarized UV light. Furthermore, the helical sense of chirality can be controlled by varying the wavelength of UV irradiation. This enables a feasible and economical method to fabricate programmable 2D patterns of chiral PDA with tailored chirality distributions, such as smooth gradients in chirality and micropatterns with tailorable circularly polarized luminescence. Our finding not only opens a pathway for producing programmable chiroptical micropatterns, but also is highly valuable for deeper understanding of symmetry breaking in enantioselective photochemical reactions. Chiral nanoparticles are capable of ultrasensitive detection, characterization, and asymmetric synthesis of chiral organic and biological molecules.

Recent reports in animal systems show that divisions of stem cells can be uncoupled from their progeny differentiation, and the outcome of a division could be influenced by microenvironmental signals. But the underlying systemlevel mechanisms, and whether this dynamics also occur in plant stem cell niches (SCN), remain elusive. This article presents a cell fate regulatory network model that contributes to understanding such mechanism and identify critical cues for cell fate transitions in the root SCN. Novel computational and experimental results show that the transcriptional regulator SHR is critical for the most frequent asymmetric division previously described for quiescent centre stem cells. A multiscale model of the root tip that simulated each cell's intracellular regulatory network, and the dynamics of SHR intercellular transport as a cellcell coupling mechanism, was developed. It revealed that quiescent centre cell divisions produce two identical cells, that may acquire different fates depending on the feedback between SHR's availability and the state of the regulatory network. Novel experimental data presented here validates our model, which in turn, constitutes the first proposed systemic mechanism for uncoupled SCN cell division and differentiation.", "authors": "Monica L.

The resulting bottlenecks have a profound impact on the genetic makeup of a species with unknown consequences for health. A key genetic factor for species survival is the evolution of deleterious mutation load, but how bottleneck strength and mutation load interact lacks empirical evidence. We analyze 60 complete genomes of six ibex species and the domestic goat. We show that historic bottlenecks rather than the current conservation status predict levels of genomewide variation. By analyzing the exceptionally wellcharacterized population bottlenecks of the once nearly extinct Alpine ibex, we find genomic evidence of concurrent purging of highly deleterious mutations but accumulation of mildly deleterious mutations. This suggests that recolonization bottlenecks induced both relaxed selection and purging, thus reshaping the landscape of deleterious mutation load. Our findings highlight that even populations of ~1000 individuals can accumulate mildly deleterious mutations. Conservation efforts should focus on preventing population declines below such levels to ensure longterm survival of species.

Net and gross primary production (NPP, GPP) are essential properties of these ecosystems, characterized by high spatial, seasonal, and interannual variability associated with climatic effects on hydrology. Over 20 years ago, Nixon defined the trophic classification of marine ecosystems based on annual phytoplankton primary production (APPP), with categories ranging from \"oligotrophic\" to \"hypertrophic\". Source data consisting of shipboard measurements of NPP and GPP from 1982 to 2004 for Chesapeake Bay in the midAtlantic region of the United States supported estimates of APPP from 300 to 500 g C m2 yr1, corresponding to \"eutrophic\" to \"hypertrophic\" categories. Here, we developed generalized additive models (GAM) to interpolate the limited spatiotemporal resolution of source data. Principal goals were: (1) to develop predictive models of NPP and GPP calibrated to source data (1982 to 2004); (2) to apply the models to historical (1960s, 1970s) and monitoring (1985 to 2015) data with adjustments for nutrient loadings and climatic effects; (3) to estimate APPP from model predictions of NPP; (4) to test effects of simulated reductions of phytoplankton biomass or nutrient loadings on trophic classification based on APPP. Simulated 40% decreases of euphoticlayer chla or TN and NO2  NO3 loadings led to decreasing APPP sufficient to change trophic classification from \"eutrophic' to \"mesotrophic\" for oligohaline (OH) and polyhaline (PH) salinity zones, and from \"hypertrophic\" to \"eutrophic\" for the mesohaline (MH) salinity zone of the bay.

However, highresolution maps of polygonal geomorphology are rarely available, due to the complexity and subtlety of ice wedge polygon relief at landscape scales. Here we present a submeter resolution map of 106 discrete ice wedge polygons across a ~1200 km2 landscape, delineated within a lidarderived digital elevation model. The delineation procedure relies on a convolutional neural network paired with a set of common image processing operations and permits explicit measurement of relative elevation at the center of each ice wedge polygon. The resulting map visualizes meter to kilometerscale spatial gradients in polygonal geomorphology across an extensive landscape with unprecedented detail. This highresolution inventory of polygonal geomorphology provides rich spatial context for extrapolating observations of environmental processes across the landscape. The map also represents an extensive baseline dataset for quantifying contemporary land surface deformation (i.e., thermokarst) at the survey area, through future topographic surveys. \n                \n                  \n                    \n                    \n                    \n                  \n                \n               Machineaccessible metadata file describing the reported data: https:doi.org10.6084m9.figshare.11871369", "authors": "Charles J.

In the present work, we show that such an optical intersite spin transfer (OISTR) from Pt to Co emerges as a dominant mechanism governing the ultrafast magnetization dynamics of a CoPt alloy. To demonstrate this, we perform a joint theoretical and experimental investigation to determine the transient changes of the helicity dependent absorption in the extreme ultraviolet spectral range. We show that the helicity dependent absorption is directly related to changes of the transient spinsplit density of states, allowing us to link the origin of OISTR to the available minority states above the Fermi level. This makes OISTR a general phenomenon in optical manipulation of multicomponent magnetic systems. Optically driven spin transfer is the fastest process to manipulate magnetism. Here, the authors show that this process emerges as the dominant mechanism in femtosecond spin dynamics enabling to the engineering of functional magnetic systems for future all optical technologies.", "authors": "Felix Willems; Clemens von Korff Schmising; Christian Struber; Daniel Schick; Dieter W.

In the mouse, male tear fluid is involved in long and shortterm effects such as the receptive behavior and pregnancy block in females and the aggression in males. In contrast, pup tears exert an inhibitory effect on male mating behavior, also promoting sexual rejection in females. In the rat, a male lacrimal protein acts as an intraspecific and heterospecific signal enhancing sexual behavior in females and evoking avoidance behavior in mouse. However, behavioral effects of female tears on male behavior have yet to be described. Here, we report that female lacrimal fluid of different mouse strains contains a relatively small and involatile factor that abolishes intermale aggression switching it into a copulatory behavior. The production of this molecule by the lacrimal glands is not affected by the estrous cycle but it is sensitive to ovariectomy, thus suggesting a control mediated by hormones. Moreover, this lacrimal antiaggression pheromone modulates the activity of the lateral habenula, a brain area responsible for the valence of the aggressive interactions.", "authors": "Rosa Maria Cavaliere; Lucia Silvotti; Riccardo Percudani; Roberto Tirindelli", "keywords": "Olfactory system; Social behaviour", "organization_affiliated": "Department of Medicine and Surgery, Neuroscience Unit, University of Parma, Parma, Italy; Department of Medicine and Surgery, Neuroscience Unit, University of Parma, Parma, Italy; Department of Chemistry, Life Sciences and Environmental Sustainability, University of Parma, Parma, Italy; Department of Medicine and Surgery, Neuroscience Unit, University of Parma, Parma, Italy"}

Once patients survive the acute phase, longterm prognosis is generally satisfactory. CVST patients who harbored risk factors known for poor prognosis (e.g., deterioration of consciousnessneurological functions and seizures) were oftentimes unresponsive to systemic heparin treatment. The advantage of combined endovascular mechanical thrombectomy (EMT) and onsite chemical thrombolysis (OCT) plus systemic heparin for CVST over the heparin treatment alone has not been proved. A retrospective study was conducted to analyze consecutive patients with CVST from 2005 to 2015. Patients having clinical improvement or stable disease after heparin treatment were in IS group; patients having continuous deterioration of consciousnessneurological functions and refractory seizures (despite the use of multiple antiepileptic drugs) after heparin treatment were in D group.

However, their modes of action are thus far not completely understood. In this study, we synthesized a gemini QAC, PMT12BF4 and found that it exerted unsurpassed broadspectrum antifungal activity against drug susceptible and resistant Candida albicans, and other pathogenic fungi, with a minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) at 1 or 2 gmL. These results indicated that PMT12BF4 used a mode of action distinct from current antifungal drugs. In addition, fungal pathogens treated with PMT12BF4 were not able to grow on fresh YPD agar plates, indicating that the effect of PMT12BF4 was fungicidal, and the minimal fungicidal concentration (MFC) against C. albicans isolates was 1 or 2 gmL. The ability of yeasttohyphal transition and biofilm formation of C. albicans was disrupted by PMT12BF4. To investigate the modes of action of PMT12BF4 in C. albicans, we used an RNA sequencing approach and screened a C. albicans deletion mutant library to identify potential pathways affected by PMT12BF4.

Lophelia pertusa is a frameworkforming coldwater coral that supports numerous ecosystem services in the deep ocean. These corals are threatened by increasing anthropogenic impacts to the deepsea, such as global ocean change and hydrocarbon extraction. This study implemented two sets of experiments to assess the effects of future conditions (temperature: 8 C and 12 C, pH: 7.9 and 7.6) and hydrocarbon exposure (oil, dispersant, oil  dispersant combined) on coral health. Phenotypic response was assessed through three independent observations of diagnostic characteristics that were combined into an average health rating at four points during exposure and recovery. In both experiments, regardless of environmental condition, average health significantly declined during 24hour exposure to dispersant alone but was not significantly altered in the other treatments. In the early recovery stage (24 hours), polyp health returned to the preexposure health state under ambient temperature in all treatments. However, increased temperature resulted in a delay in recovery (72 hours) from dispersant exposure. These experiments provide evidence that global ocean change can affect the resilience of corals to environmental stressors and that exposure to chemical dispersants may pose a greater threat than oil itself.", "authors": "Alexis M.

The synthesized nanoparticles loaded with drug were characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), laser scattering and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) methods. The FTIR spectrum of the alginatechitosanlovastatin nanoparticles showed that chitosan and alginate interacted with lovastatin through hydrogen bonding and dipolardipolar interactions between the CO, CO, and OH groups in lovastatin, the CO, NH, and OH groups in chitosan and the CO, CO, and OH groups in alginate. The laser scattering results and SEM images indicated that the alginatechitosanlovastatin nanoparticles have a spherical shape with a particle size in the range of 5080 nm. The DSC diagrams displayed that the melting temperature of the alginatechitosanlovastatin nanoparticles was higher than that of chitosan and lower than that of alginate. This result means that the alginate and chitosan interact together, so that the nanoparticles have a larger crystal degree when compared with alginate and chitosan individually. Investigations of the in vitro lovastatin release from the alginatechitosanlovastatin nanoparticles under different conditions, including different alginatechitosan ratios, different solution pH values and different lovastatin contents, were carried out by ultravioletvisible spectroscopy. The rate of drug release from the nanoparticles is proportional to the increase in the solution pH and inversely proportional to the content of the loaded lovastatin. The drug release process is divided into two stages: a rapid stage over the first 10 hr, then the release becomes gradual and stable. The KorsmeyerPeppas model is most suitable for the lovastatin release process from the alginatechitosanlovastatin nanoparticles in the first stage, and then the drug release complies with other models depending on solution pH in the slow release stage. In addition, the toxicity of alginatechitosanlovastatin (abbreviated ACL) nanoparticles was sufficiently low in mice in the acute toxicity test. The LD50 of the drug was higher than 5000 mgkg, while in the subchronic toxicity test with treatments of 100 mgkg and 300 mgkg ACL nanoparticles, there were no abnormal signs, mortality, or toxicity in general to the function or structure of the crucial organs.

We used a mathematical model to estimate the expected difference in healthcare costs, difference in disabilityadjusted life years (DALYs) and costeffectiveness of removing HCV restrictions for lung and kidney donations in Australia. Our model suggests that allowing organ donations from people who inject drugs, people with a history of incarceration and people who are HCV antibodypositive could lead to an estimated 10% increase in organ supply, populationlevel improvements in health (reduction in DALYs), and on average save AU2,399 (95%CI AU1,1553,352) and AU2,611 (95%CI AU1,8353,869) per person requiring a lung and kidney transplant respectively. These findings are likely to hold for international settings, since this policy change remained cost saving with positive health gains regardless of HCV prevalence, HCV treatment cost and waiting list survival probabilities.

Inspired by natural photosynthesis, this work proposes a photodriven H2evolving liposomal nanoplatform (Lip NP) that comprises an upconversion nanoparticle (UCNP) that is conjugated with gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) via a ROSresponsive linker, which is encapsulated inside the liposomal system in which the lipid bilayer embeds chlorophyll a (Chla). The UCNP functions as a transducer, converting NIR light into upconversion luminescence for simultaneous imaging and therapy in situ. Functioning as lightharvesting antennas, AuNPs are used to detect the local concentration of ROS for FRET biosensing, while the Chla activates the photosynthesis of H2 gas to scavenge local excess ROS. The results thus obtained indicate the potential of using the Lip NPs in the analysis of biological tissues, restoring their ROS homeostasis, possibly preventing the initiation and progression of diseases. Hydrogen can be used to reduce the concentration of reactive oxygen species (ROS), but its delivery to diseased tissues is challenging due to its low solubility. Here the authors develop a photosynthesisinspired FRET nanocomplex to detect and scavenge local excess of ROS in the tissue using photocatalytic hydrogen production.", "authors": "WeiLin Wan; Bo Tian; YuJung Lin; Chiranjeevi Korupalli; MingYen Lu; Qinghua Cui; Dehui Wan; Yen Chang; HsingWen Sung", "keywords": "Biomaterials; Biosensors; Nanobiotechnology; Sensors and probes", "organization_affiliated": "Department of Chemical Engineering and Institute of Biomedical Engineering, Frontier Research Center on Fundamental and Applied Sciences of Matters, National Tsing Hua University, Hsinchu, Taiwan, ROC; Department of Chemical Engineering and Institute of Biomedical Engineering, Frontier Research Center on Fundamental and Applied Sciences of Matters, National Tsing Hua University, Hsinchu, Taiwan, ROC; Department of Chemical Engineering and Institute of Biomedical Engineering, Frontier Research Center on Fundamental and Applied Sciences of Matters, National Tsing Hua University, Hsinchu, Taiwan, ROC; Department of Chemical Engineering and Institute of Biomedical Engineering, Frontier Research Center on Fundamental and Applied Sciences of Matters, National Tsing Hua University, Hsinchu, Taiwan, ROC; Department of Materials Science and Engineering, National Tsing Hua University, Hsinchu, Taiwan, ROC; Department of Chemical Engineering and Institute of Biomedical Engineering, Frontier Research Center on Fundamental and Applied Sciences of Matters, National Tsing Hua University, Hsinchu, Taiwan, ROC; Department of Chemical Engineering and Institute of Biomedical Engineering, Frontier Research Center on Fundamental and Applied Sciences of Matters, National Tsing Hua University, Hsinchu, Taiwan, ROC; Taipei Tzu Chi Hospital, Buddhist Tzu Chi Medical Foundation and School of Medicine, Tzu Chi University, Hualien, Taiwan, ROC; Department of Chemical Engineering and Institute of Biomedical Engineering, Frontier Research Center on Fundamental and Applied Sciences of Matters, National Tsing Hua University, Hsinchu, Taiwan, ROC"}

We performed an experimental neuroimaging study where medical doctors (MDs) performed a treatment task while their brain activation pattern was measured, using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). MDs (2537 years old) first performed a standardized clinical exam of a \"professional patient\". Unbeknownst to the doctors, the professional patient was a confederate that rated the doctors' clinical examination using the Consultation And Relational Empathy (CARE) questionnaire, a standardized protocol assessing a clinician's social interaction during a consultation. After the clinical exam, MDs were placed inside a brain scanner and the patient was placed on a chair next to the MD. MDs performed a treatment task where an analgesic device was used to alleviate the patient's pain (experimentally induced), while the MD's brain activity was measured with fMRI. MDs rated their own empathic concern (equivalent of compassion) and personal distress using the Interpersonal Reactivity Index questionnaire. The patient's rating of CARE was robustly related to the MD's own ratings of trait empathic concern and to compassionrelated and rewardrelated activation of medial frontal brain regions during treatment. In contrast, there was no relation with MD's personal distress, nor with activation in regions associated with the aversive component of experiencing empathy. We conclude that a patient's positive experience of a medical examination is reflected in doctors' empathic concern and rewardrelated brain activations during treatment, suggesting that compassion and pleasure are key factors for successful doctorpatient interactions.", "authors": "Karin Jensen; Randy L.

However, current evidence indicates that diabetes prevention programmes based on lifestyle change have not been successful in preventing T2DM in individuals with isolated impaired fasting glucose. We propose that further research is needed to identify effective lifestyle interventions for individuals with isolated impaired fasting glucose. Furthermore, we call for the identification of innovative approaches that better identify people with impaired glucose tolerance, who benefit from the currently available lifestylebased diabetes prevention programmes.

In most previous studies investigating the sharing of pain, a signal conveying a painful experience is presented by a target (\"sender\") as a stimulus to a participant (\"receiver\"), and the emotionalphysiological responses of the participant are measured. However, this unilateral \"senderreceiver\" paradigm does not adequately address the possible bidirectional experience of shared pain accruing from interaction. Our aim was therefore to investigate the bidirectional effects of sharing pain in social settings. Thirtysix unfamiliar pairs were simultaneously and repeatedly exposed to the same painprovoking (thermal) stimuli, either in a facetoface or a \"shielded\" condition where a partition prevented the partner's responses from being fully observed. We recorded the blood volume pulse of each participant to measure the acute sympathetic response while a pair of participants experienced the stimuli simultaneously. The results revealed that participants with weaker reactions elevated their physiological reactivity to the stimulus in accordance with their partner's reactions in the facetoface condition. The pairlevel physiological similarity was also higher compared to the shielded condition.

We revealed that IF1 overexpression leads to a substantial decrease in ATP levels and reduced glucosestimulated insulin secretion. A decrease in total cellular ATP content was also reflected in decreased free ATP cytosolic and mitochondrial levels, as monitored with ATeam biosensor. Consistently, cellular respiration of IF1overexpressing cells was decreased. 3D structured illumination microscopy (SIM) revealed a higher amount of insulin granules with higher volume in IF1overexpressing cells. Similar effects occurred when cells were incubated at low glucose concentrations. Noteworthy, activation of PKA by dibutyryl cAMP entirely abolished the inhibitory effect of IF1 overexpression on ATP production and insulin secretion. Mitochondrial network morphology and cristae ultrastructure in INS1E overexpressing IF1 remained mostly unchanged.

These cows experience a negative energy balance, resulting in a distinct blood metabolism and poor reproductive function due to impaired ovulation and increased embryo loss. We hypothesize that oocytes from lactating cows undergoing transient metabolic stress exhibit a different epigenetic profile crucial for developmental competence. To investigate this, we collected oocytes from metabolicallyprofiled cows at early and midpostpartum stages and characterized their epigenetic landscape compared with control heifers using wholegenome bisulfite sequencing. Earlypostpartum cows were metabolically deficient with a significantly lower energy balance and significantly higher concentrations of nonesterified fatty acids and betahydroxybutyrate than midpostpartum animals and control heifers. Accordingly, 32,990 earlypostpartumspecific differentially methylated regions (DMRs) were found in genes involved in metabolic pathways, carbon metabolism, and fatty acid metabolism, likely descriptive of the epigenetic regulation of metabolism in earlypostpartum oocytes. DMRs found overlapping CpG islands and exons of imprinted genes such as MEST and GNAS in earlypostpartum oocytes suggest that early lactation metabolic stress may affect imprint acquisition, which could explain the embryo loss.

Although both human and animal studies have implicated striatal D2like and D1like receptors (D2R; D1R) in this form of flexibility, less is known about the contribution they make within distinct subregions of the striatum and the different phases of visual reversal learning. The present study investigated the involvement of D2R and D1R during the early (perseverative) phase of reversal learning as well as in the intermediate and late stages (new learning) after microinfusions of D2R and D1R antagonists into the nucleus accumbens core and shell (NAcC; NAcS), the anterior and posterior dorsomedial striatum (DMS) and the dorsolateral striatum (DLS) on a touchscreen visual serial reversallearning task. Reversal learning was improved after dopamine receptor blockade in the nucleus accumbens; the D1R antagonist, SCH23390, in the NAcS and the D2R antagonist, raclopride, in the NAcC selectively reduced early, perseverative errors. In contrast, reversal learning was impaired by D2R antagonism, but not D1R antagonism, in the dorsal striatum: raclopride increased errors in the intermediate phase after DMS infusions, and increased errors across phases after DLS infusions. These findings indicate that D1R and D2R modulate different stages of reversal learning through effects localised to different subregions of the striatum.

Overexpression of GRP78 and PDI following endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and activation of the unfolded protein response (UPR) promote growth and invasion in cancer. To identify novel prognostic biomarkers in EOC, here we determined the expression of ER stressassociated proteins (GRP78, ATF6 and PERK) and correlated with clinical outcome in EOC. Tissue microarray (TMA) samples from 415 tissues collected from three cancer centers (UM, USC, and KCCRI) were used to assess the expression levels of ERassociated proteins using immunohistochemistry (IHC). We observed that the expression levels of GRP78 (p  0.0001), ATF6 (p  0.0001), and PERK (p  0.0001) were significantly increased in specimens of EOC compared to normal tissues, including in the serous subtype (p  0.0001). Previously we reported that high expression of PDI correlated with poor patient survival in EOC. Here we showed that overexpression of GRP78 and PDI protein expression correlated with poor patient survival (p  0.03), while low expression of combined GRP78 and PDI correlated with better survival (p  0.01) in highgrade serous. The increased expression of ER stressassociated proteins in EOC suggests a role for ER stress and the UPR in EOC. More importantly, our results demonstrate that GRP78 and PDI are potential biomarkers for EOC and could be used as dual prognostic markers.", "authors": "Soma Samanta; Shuzo Tamura; Louis Dubeau; Paulette MhawechFauceglia; Yohei Miyagi; Hisamori Kato; Rich Lieberman; Ronald J.

Some metabolic pathways were specific to some MAGs, including sulfur oxidation, nitrate reduction, and flagellar assembly. Amino acid exporters were identified in MAGs identified as important for host fitness, and pathways for key vitamin biosynthesis and export were identified across MAGs.

Though the presence of virus in joints and associated inflammation has been implicated as one of the reasons for the acute and chronic polyarthritis post alphaviral infections, the basis for rheumatic like outcomes is not clear. Through an in silico analysis, we have investigated the possibility of an autoimmune process mediated through molecular mimicry in alphaviral infection induced pathogenicity. Interestingly, sequence alignment of the structural polyproteins belonging to arthritogenic alphaviruses revealed conserved regions which share homology with human proteins implicated in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). These conserved regions were predicted to exhibit binding to HLA class II alleles, showcasing their potential to incite T cell help. Molecular docking of the viral peptide and the corresponding homologous region in the human protein onto HLADRB1 revealed strong similarities in their binding patterns. Linear and conformational B cell epitope prediction analyses showed that these potential mimics have high propensity to elicit an efficient B cell response. We thus propose that the origin of polyarthritis postarthritogenic alphaviral infections may also be mediated through a hitherto unknown autoimmune response due to the presence of crossreactive epitopes between viral and human proteins.", "authors": "Siva Sai Krishna Venigalla; Sowmya Premakumar; Vani Janakiraman", "keywords": "Autoimmunity; Computational biology and bioinformatics", "organization_affiliated": "Department of Biotechnology, Bhupat and Jyoti Mehta School of Biosciences, Indian Institute of Technology Madras, Chennai, India; Department of Biotechnology, Bhupat and Jyoti Mehta School of Biosciences, Indian Institute of Technology Madras, Chennai, India; Department of Biotechnology, Bhupat and Jyoti Mehta School of Biosciences, Indian Institute of Technology Madras, Chennai, India"}

However, the underlying regulatory networks from oncogenic signaling pathway to epigenetic dysregulation remain largely unclear. Here we showed that STAT3 signaling, one of the critical links between inflammation and cancer, acted as a control pathway in gastric carcinogenesis. STAT3 aberrantly transactivates the epigenetic kinase mitogen and stressactivated protein kinase 1 (MSK1), thereby phosphorylating histone H3 serine10 (H3S10) and STAT3 itself during carcinogeninduced gastric tumorigenesis. We further identified the calcium pathway transcription factor NFATc2 as a novel downstream target of the STAT3MSK1 positiveregulating loop. STAT3 forms a functional complex with MSK1 at the promoter of NFATc2 to promote its transcription in a H3S10 phosphorylationdependent way, thus affecting NFATc2related inflammatory pathways in gastric carcinogenesis. Inhibiting the STAT3MSK1NFATc2 signaling axis significantly suppressed gastric cancer cell proliferation and xenograft tumor growth, which provides a potential novel approach for gastric carcinogenesis intervention by regulating aberrant epigenetic and transcriptional mechanisms.", "authors": "Hongyan Qi; Zhiyi Yang; Chujun Dai; Runan Wang; Xinxin Ke; Shuilian Zhang; Xueping Xiang; Kailin Chen; Chen Li; Jindan Luo; Jimin Shao; Jing Shen", "keywords": "Epigenetics; Gastric cancer", "organization_affiliated": "Department of Pathology and Pathophysiology, and Department of Radiation Oncology of the Second Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Hangzhou, China; Department of Pathology and Pathophysiology, and Department of Medical Oncology of the Second Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Hangzhou, China; Department of Pathology and Pathophysiology, and Department of Medical Oncology of the Second Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Hangzhou, China; Department of Pathology and Pathophysiology, and Department of Medical Oncology of the Second Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Hangzhou, China; Department of Pathology and Pathophysiology, and Department of Medical Oncology of the Second Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Hangzhou, China; Department of Pathology and Pathophysiology, and Department of Medical Oncology of the Second Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Hangzhou, China; Department of Pathology, the Second Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Hangzhou, China; Department of Pathology and Pathophysiology, and Department of Medical Oncology of the Second Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Hangzhou, China; Institute of Genetics and Department of Genetics, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Hangzhou, China; The First Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Hangzhou, China; Department of Pathology and Pathophysiology, and Cancer Institute of the Second Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Hangzhou, China; Department of Pathology and Pathophysiology, and Department of Medical Oncology of the Second Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Hangzhou, China"}

It is therefore essential to develop novel strategies to unravel the spectrum of pediatric cancer genes. Statistical network modeling techniques have emerged as powerful methodologies for enabling the inference of genedisease relationship and have been performed on adult but not pediatric cancers. We performed a deep multilayer understanding of pancancer transcriptome data selected from the Treehouse Childhood Cancer Initiative through a coexpression network analysis. We identified six modules strongly associated with pediatric tumor histotypes that were functionally linked to developmental processes. Topological analyses highlighted that pediatric cancer predisposition genes and potential therapeutic targets were central regulators of cancerhistotype specific modules. A module was related to multiple pediatric malignancies with functions involved in DNA repair and cell cycle regulation. This canonical oncogenic module gathered most of the childhood cancer predisposition genes and clinically actionable genes. In pediatric acute leukemias, the driver genes were coexpressed in a module related to epigenetic and posttranscriptional processes, suggesting a critical role of these pathways in the progression of hematologic malignancies.

Tropical and boreal forests contributed equally, and with the largest share of the mean global terrestrial carbon sink. CO2 fertilization was found to be the main driver increasing the terrestrial carbon sink from 1992 to 2015, but the net effect of all drivers (CO2 fertilization and nitrogen deposition, LULCC and meteorological forcing) caused a reduction and an increase, respectively, in the terrestrial carbon sink for tropical and boreal forests. These diverging trends were not observed when applying a conventional LULCC dataset, but were also evident in satellite passive microwave estimates of aboveground biomass. These datasets thereby converge on the conclusion that LULCC have had a greater impact on tropical forests than previously estimated, causing an increase and decrease of the contributions of boreal and tropical forests, respectively, to the growing terrestrial carbon sink.

When the crosstalk between host and microbiota is perturbed early in life, a pathological imprinting may develop that is characterized by excessive immune reactivity in adulthood, which translates into increased susceptibility to inflammatory pathologies. In this review, we discuss the recent data that demonstrate the existence of a time window of opportunity early in life during which mice and human have to be exposed to microbiota in order to develop a balanced immune system.

Their effect on the soil strength improvement was experimentally investigated by performing unconfined compression, splitting tensile, triaxial, and direct shear tests. All tests were performed with different biopolymer concentrations and curing periods. Additionally, in order to have an insight on the susceptibility to natural elements, plain soil, and biopolymertreated specimens were exposed to real atmospheric conditions. The extensive experimental results showed that the soil strength tends to increase with the increase of biopolymer concentration and with the curing time. However, it was shown that the soil strength does not considerably change after a certain biopolymer concentration level and curing time. Furthermore, it has been observed that the biopolymertreated specimens showed better resistance to the influence of the environmental conditions. In general, Xanthan Gum, Guar Gum, and Beta 1,31,6 Glucan showed the most dominant effect and potential for the future of sustainable engineering.", "authors": "Antonio Soldo; Marta Miletic; Maria L.

To model clonal dynamics in vivo, we serially transplanted 23 AML cases to immunodeficient mice and followed clonal composition for up to 15 months by wholeexome sequencing of 84 xenografts across two generations. We demonstrate vast changes in clonality that both progress and reverse over time, and define five patterns of clonal dynamics: Monoclonal, Stable, Loss, Expansion and Burst. We also show that subclonal expansion in vivo correlates with a more adverse prognosis. Furthermore, clonal expansion enabled detection of very rare clones with AML driver mutations that were undetectable by sequencing at diagnosis, demonstrating that the vast majority of AML cases harbor multiple clones already at diagnosis. Finally, the rise and fall of related clones enabled deconstruction of the complex evolutionary hierarchies of the clones that compete to shape AML over time.

To test this hypothesis, 51 healthy women underwent fear acquisition training, consisting of repeated presentations of two ingroup and two outgroup faces. One of each (CS) was paired with an electrical stimulation (unconditional stimulus, UCS), whereas the other was not coupled with the UCS (CS). During immediate extinction training, all CS were presented again. On the next day, a retrieval and reinstatement test took place after a stress or a control procedure. Confirming previous research, impaired extinction learning occurred for outgroup relative to ingroup faces. During the reinstatement test, stress specifically increased responding towards the outgroup CS, thus reducing its safety signaling properties.

This \"Small Data\" challenge may need a mindset that is entirely different from the existing Big Data paradigm. Here, under the small data scenarios, we examined whether the network structure has a substantial influence on the performance and whether the optimal structure is predominantly determined by sample size or data nature. To this end, we listed all possible combinations of layers given an upper bound of the VCdimension to study how structural hyperparameters affected the performance. Our results showed that structural optimization improved accuracy by 27.99%, 16.44%, and 13.11% over random selection for a sample size of 100, 500, and 1,000 in the MNIST dataset, respectively, suggesting that the importance of the network structure increases as the sample size becomes smaller. Furthermore, the optimal network structure was mostly determined by the data nature (photographic, calligraphic, or medical images), and less affected by the sample size, suggesting that the optimal network structure is datadriven, not sample size driven. After network structure optimization, the convolutional neural network could achieve 91.13% accuracy with only 500 samples, 93.66% accuracy with only 1000 samples for the MNIST dataset and 94.10% accuracy with only 3300 samples for the Mitosis (microscopic) dataset.

We explore the relationship between foraging season length during a female's pregnancy and postweaning calf survival and reproduction. Approximately 77% of the variation in calf survival, which ranged annually from 1080%, was associated with the duration of the feeding season while the mother was pregnant. Poor body conditions and prolonged interbirth intervals of western gray whales have also been documented to coincide with shorter duration in feeding seasons found in this study.

During the Byzantine period in the 4th century CE, large settlements were established in the arid region of the Negev Desert, Israel, but it remains unclear why it did so, and why the settlements were abandoned three centuries later. Previous theories proposed that the Negev was a \"green desert\" in the early 1st millennium CE, and that the Byzantine Empire withdrew from this region due to a dramatic climatic downturn. In the absence of a local climate archive correlated to the ByzantineEarly Islamic transition, testing this theory has proven challenging. We use stable isotopic indicators of animal dietary and mobility patterns to assess the extent of the vegetative cover in the desert. By doing so, we aim to detect possible climatic fluctuations that may have led to the abandonment of the Byzantine settlements. The findings show that the Negev Desert was not greener during the time period under investigation than it is today and that the composition of the animals' diets, as well as their grazing mobility patterns, remained unchanged through the ByzantineEarly Islamic transition.

First, we generated \"FlySilico\", a curated metabolic network of Drosophila, and performed timeresolved growth and metabolite measurements with larvae raised on a holidic diet.

Five processed CGFS samples with different sizes and carbon contents were obtained. The effects of particle size, unburned carbon, and surface properties of CGFS on the comprehensive properties of filled styrene butadiene rubber (SBR) were investigated. The mechanical properties were improved with decreasing CGFS size, and the curing and mechanical properties exhibited better performance owing to the unburned carbon. Unburned carbon can improve the dispersion properties of the filler and the compatibility between the matrix and filler. The best values for the curing characteristics and mechanical properties of SBR appeared when CGFSS2 and CGFSS3 were used as the fillers, respectively. Heavy calcium carbonate (CaCO3) particles were used as a comparative filler, and the results demonstrated that CGFS particles have the potential to replace CaCO3 in rubber. A novel method for preparing coal gasification fine slag (CGFS) samples utilized as a reinforcing filler for the SBR matrix through an efficient pneumatic separation technique has been demonstrated. The superior fillerrubber interfacial interaction can contribute to significant reinforcement in the comprehensive performances of composites by the addition of CGFS series fillers into the SBR matrix.

Just as for any other quantum device, suppressing Hamiltonian control errors will be necessary before quantum annealers can achieve speedups. Such analog control errors are known to lead to Jchaos, wherein the probability of obtaining the optimal solution, encoded as the ground state of the intended Hamiltonian, varies widely depending on the control error. Here, we show that Jchaos causes a catastrophic failure of quantum annealing, in that the scaling of the timetosolution metric becomes worse than that of a deterministic (exhaustive) classical solver. We demonstrate this empirically using random Ising spin glass problems run on the two latest generations of the DWave quantum annealers. We then proceed to show that this doomsday scenario can be mitigated using a simple error suppression and correction scheme known as quantum annealing correction (QAC). By using QAC, the timetosolution scaling of the same DWave devices is improved to below that of the classical upper bound, thus restoring hope in the speedup prospects of quantum annealing.", "authors": "Adam Pearson; Anurag Mishra; Itay Hen; Daniel A.

The mist spray treatments were conducted at the flowering period, which were at August 610 for early rice variety and September 15 for late one. Four treatments at different irrigation times (T1: 08:00; T2: 12:00; T3: 14:00; CK: no mist spray; mist spray amount of 1 Lm2) were included. The temperature and humidity at the different heights of the rice canopy and the net solar radiation above the canopy were measured. The leaf senescence, chlorophyll content, photosynthetic rate and the yields of the rice were determined. The results showed that mist spray rapidly reduced the temperature and increased the relative humidity in the canopy. The cooling effect was most significant at the top of the canopy and decreased downward from the top of canopy. The duration of the temperature decrease caused by the mist spray was 2 h. Mist spray could lead to an increase in latent heat flux (LE) and a decrease in sensible heat flux (H) in the rice field. The mist spray treatments delayed the senescence of the rice leaves, increased the activity levels of the superoxide dismutase, peroxidase, catalase, and soluble protein, reduced the malondialdehyde content, increased leaf chlorophyll content, photosynthetic rate and yield. The T2 treatment showed the most significant effect against heat stress, with the yield of the two varieties increased 13.7 and 13.6% respectively.

In all fourteen adolescents with OHVIRA the oblique vaginal septum was incised successfully without any intraoperative complications. Postoperative pain was unremarkable and each patient's symptoms resolved postoperatively. The 3month postoperative follow up office vaginoscopy revealed that the vaginal septum had not reformed nor was any vaginal stenosis noted. Vaginoscopic incision of the oblique vaginal septum using a \"NoTouch\" technique is a safe, minimally invasive, and effective approach for treating OHVIRA syndrome in adolescents with hematocolpos.

Without a timeresolved and microscopic mechanism, one has to assume simultaneous appearance of CDW and periodic lattice distortions (PLD). Here, we accomplish a complete separation of ultrafast exciton and PLD dynamics and unravel their interplay in our realtime timedependent density functional theory simulations. We find that laser pulses knock off the exciton order and induce a homogeneous bondingantibonding transition in the initial 20 fs, then the weakened electronic order triggers ionic movements antiparallel to the original PLD. The EPC comes into play after the initial 20 fs, and the two processes mutually amplify each other leading to a complete inversion of CDW ordering. The selfamplified dynamics reproduces the evolution of band structures in agreement with photoemission experiments. Hence we resolve the key processes in the initial dynamics of CDWs that help elucidate the underlying mechanism. The physical origins of charge density waves in 1TTiSe2 and their response to ultrafast excitation have long been a topic of theoretical and experimental debate.

In about one third of cases, this virus affects children under five years of age, causing each year up to 200,000 child deaths, mainly in the developing countries. Norovirus outbreaks are associated with very significant economic losses, with an estimated societal cost of 60 billion dollars per year. Despite the marked socioeconomic consequences associated, no therapeutic options or vaccines are currently available to treat or prevent this infection. One promising target to identify new antiviral agents for norovirus is the viral polymerase, which has a pivotal role for the viral replication and lacks closely homologous structures in the host. Starting from the scaffold of a novel class of norovirus polymerase inhibitors recently discovered in our research group with a computeraided method, different new chemical modifications were designed and carried out, with the aim to identify improved agents effective against norovirus replication in cellbased assays. While different new inhibitors of the viral polymerase were found, a further computeraided ligand optimisation approach led to the identification of a new antiviral scaffold for norovirus, which inhibits human norovirus replication at lowmicromolar concentrations.", "authors": "Gilda Giancotti; Ilaria Rigo; Gaia Pasqualetto; Mark T.

We found that PFT failed to prevent the effects of Mdm2 inhibitor Nutlin3 on cell cycle and apoptosis in several cancer cell lines. However, PFT rescued normal primary fibroblasts from growth inhibition by Nutlin3. PFT displayed a very limited effect on p53dependent transcription upon its activation by Nutlin3. Moreover, PFT inhibitory effect on transcription was highly dependent on the nature of the p53 target gene. PFT attenuated posttranslational modifications of p53 without affecting total p53 protein level. Finally, we found that PFT can decrease the level of intracellular reactive oxygen species through activation of an aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR)Nrf2 axis in a p53independent manner.

Although these recurrent tumors typically remain dependent on the androgen receptor (AR), nonARdriven tumors that also emerge are particularly deadly and becoming more prevalent. Here, we present a new genetically engineered mouse model for nonARdriven prostate cancer that centers on a negative regulator of G proteincoupled receptors that is downregulated in aggressive human prostate tumors. Thus, prostatespecific expression of a dominantnegative G proteincoupled receptor kinase 2 (GRK2DN) transgene diminishes AR and AR target gene expression in the prostate, and confers resistance to castrationinduced involution. Further, the GRK2DN transgene dramatically accelerates oncogeneinitiated prostate tumorigenesis by increasing primary tumor size, potentiating visceral organ metastasis, suppressing AR, and inducing neuroendocrine marker mRNAs.

The solutioncoating process used was a newly developed method of vortexflowassisted solutioncoating with the support of spinning of the coating solution. It is shown that the vortexflowassisted spincoating process can produce highquality thin films at nanoscale thicknesses by controlling the liquid surface of the coating solutions, which can easily be adjusted by changing the spinning speed, even on complex curvilinear surfaces, i.e., a quasiomnidirectional coating. This excellent filmforming ability without any serious film defects is mainly due to the reduction of line tension among the solution, air, and the substrate at the contact line due to vortex flows of the coating solution on the substrate during the vortexspincoating process. As a proof of concept, we present vortexspincoated 3D OLEDs fabricated on biconvex lens substrates which exhibit excellent device performance with high brightness and current efficiency levels comparable to those of a conventional spincoated 2D planar OLED on a flat substrate. It is also shown that the EL emission from the 3D OLED on the biconvex lens substrate exhibits a diffusive Lambertian radiation pattern.

In this investigation, the vibrational behavior of TMLTNs, taking black phosphorus (BP), graphene and BN as examples, is studied adopting molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and the sandwich plate model (SPM). The MD results show that the fundamental resonant frequency of multilayered BP (MLBP) and multilayered BN (MLBN) increase obviously with the number of layers. However, the fundamental resonant frequency of a multilayered graphene sheet (MLGS) rise slightly when the number of layers increases. This phenomenon is caused by the shear modulus in the xzplane and yzplane resulted by the vdW force.

We report Pathogen Hybrid Capture (PatHCap), a method to enrich for bacterial mRNA and deplete bacterial rRNA simultaneously from dual RNAseq libraries using transcriptomespecific probes. By addressing both the differential RNA content of the host relative to the infecting bacterium and the overwhelming abundance of uninformative structural RNAs (rRNA, tRNA) of both species in a single step, this approach enables analysis of very lowinput RNA samples. By sequencing libraries before (prePatHCap) and after (postPatHCap) enrichment, we achieve dual transcriptional profiling of host and bacteria, respectively, from the same sample. Importantly, enrichment preserves relative transcript abundance and increases the number of unique bacterial transcripts per gene in postPatHCap libraries compared to prePatHCap libraries at the same sequencing depth, thereby decreasing the sequencing depth required to fully capture the transcriptional profile of the infecting bacteria. We demonstrate that PatHCap enables the study of lowinput samples including single eukaryotic cells infected by 13 Pseudomonas aeruginosa bacteria and paired hostpathogen temporal gene expression analysis of Mycobacterium tuberculosis infecting macrophages. PatHCap can be applied to the study of a range of pathogens and microbial species, and more generally, to lowlyabundant species in mixed populations.", "authors": "Viktoria Betin; Cristina Penaranda; Nirmalya Bandyopadhyay; Rui Yang; Angela Abitua; Roby P.

Herein, we report highresolution (~50 nm) and nondestructive threedimensional observations of crack initiation and propagation under applied stress. This evaluation reveals that voids and cracks do not simply result from local stresses but instead occur largely through two competing nanoscale mechanisms, namely, fibreplastic interface debonding and inplastic crack initiation.

We have previously demonstrated that the combination of chronic testosterone (T) treatment and an obesogenic Westernstyle diet (WSD) exerts synergistic functional effects on WAT, leading to increased lipid accumulation in visceral adipocytes by an unknown mechanism. In this study, we examined the wholegenome transcriptional response in visceral WAT to T and WSD, alone and in combination. We observed a synergistic effect of T and WSD on gene expression, resulting in upregulation of lipid storage genes concomitant with adipocyte hypertrophy. Because DNA methylation is known to be associated with body fat distribution and the etiology of PCOS, we conducted wholegenome DNA methylation analysis of visceral WAT. While only a fraction of differentially expressed genes also exhibited differential DNA methylation, in silico analysis showed that differentially methylated regions were enriched in transcription factor binding motifs, suggesting a potential gene regulatory role for these regions.

MMP enzymatic activity is inhibited by the tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase (TIMP14) family of proteins, suggesting that TIMPs may possess antitumor activity. TIMP2 is a promiscuous MMP inhibitor that is ubiquitously expressed in normal tissues. In this study, we address inconsistencies in the literature regarding the role of TIMP2 in tumor progression by analyzing coexpressed genes in tumor vs. normal tissue.

Here, we used a comparative genomewide microscopybased functional screening approach to identify miRNAs controlling infection by two bacterial pathogensSalmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium and Shigella flexneri. Despite the similarities between these pathogens, we found infections to be controlled by largely nonoverlapping subsets of miRNAs, seemingly reflecting different requirements prompted by their distinct intracellular lifestyles. By characterizing a small subset of miRNAs chosen among the strongest inhibitors of Shigella infection, we discovered that miR3668, miR47325p and miR6073 exert a selective effect on Shigella infection by impairing bacterial actinbased motility by downregulating NWASP. Additionally, by identifying let7i3p miRNA as a strong inhibitor of Salmonella replication and performing indepth analysis of its mechanisms of action, we showed that this miRNA specifically inhibits Salmonella infection via modulation of endolysosomal trafficking and the vacuolar environment by targeting the host RGS2 protein. These findings illustrate two paradigms underlying miRNAmediated regulation of bacterial infection, acting as part of the host response to infection, or as part of bacterial strategies to modulate the host environment and favour pathogenesis. This study reports a microscopybased screen to find microRNAs (miRNAs) that control infection by Salmonella and Shigella, showing they have different requirements.

We investigated whether the change in maternal HRV affected the LF component in infants held by their mothers. In older infants (N  14, 68 months) the LF power showed an increase during maternal paced breathing, whereas a delayed increase occurred after termination of maternal paced breathing in younger infants (N  16, 35 months). These results show that the effects of maternal cardiac activity on the infant's HRV are agedependent. This agedependent reactivity of the infant's HRV could be due to the development of the inner model in infants which regulates physiological functions, including cardiac activity. This finding might help develop efficient methods for enhancing vagal nerve activity in infants.", "authors": "Ayami Suga; Maki Uraguchi; Akiko Tange; Hiroki Ishikawa; Hideki Ohira", "keywords": "Human behaviour; Physiology", "organization_affiliated": "Unicharm Corporation, Kagawa, Japan; Department of Psychology, Nagoya University, Nagoya, Japan; Department of Psychology, Nagoya University, Nagoya, Japan; Unicharm Corporation, Kagawa, Japan; Unicharm Corporation, Kagawa, Japan; Department of Psychology, Nagoya University, Nagoya, Japan"}

Here we construct twodroplet synthetic tissue modules that function in an aqueous environment. One droplet contains a cellfree protein synthesis system and a prodrugactivating enzyme and the other a smallmolecule prodrug analog. When a Zn2sensitive protein pore is made in the first droplet, it allows the prodrug to migrate from the second droplet and become activated by the enzyme. With Zn2 in the external medium, the activated molecule is retained in the module until it is released ondemand by a divalent cation chelator. The module is constructed in such a manner that one or more, potentially with different properties, might be incorporated into extended synthetic tissues, including patterned materials generated by 3Dprinting. Such modules will thereby increase the sophistication of synthetic tissues for applications including controlled multidrug delivery. Droplet networks capable of transporting molecules between compartments can function as tissuelike materials. Here an encapsulated transcriptiontranslation system generates a Zncontrolled membrane pore, which allows interdroplet transport, enzymatic deprotection and controlled release of a small molecule to the external environment.", "authors": "Michael J.

An understanding of this perceptual phenomenon depends on knowledge about how the spatial relationship between two sounds affects neural responses to the sounds. We used the rat as a model system and equalprobability twotone sequences as stimuli to evaluate how spatial separation between two asynchronously recurring sounds affected responses to the sounds in midbrain auditory neurons. We found that responses elicited by two tone bursts when they were colocalized at the ear contralateral to the neuron were different from the responses elicited by the same sounds when they were separated with one at the contralateral ear while the other at another location. For neurons with transient sounddriven firing and not responsive to stimulation presented at the ipsilateral ear, the response to a sound with a fixed location at the contralateral ear was enhanced when the second sound was separated. These neurons were likely important for detecting a sound in the presence of a spatially separated competing sound. Our results suggest that mechanisms underlying effects of spatial separation on neural responses to sounds may include adaptation and longlasting binaural excitatoryinhibitory interaction.", "authors": "Mathiang G.

Here we investigate the evolution of cognitive bias by individuals investing into a project that delivers joint benefits. For members of a group that learn how much to invest using the costs and benefits they experience in repeated interactions, we show that overestimation of the cost of investing can evolve. The bias causes individuals to invest less into the project. Our explanation is that learning responds to immediate rather than longerterm rewards. There are thus cognitive limitations in learning, which can be seen as bounded rationality. Over a time horizon of several rounds of interaction, individuals respond to each other's investments, for instance by partially compensating for another's shortfall. However, learning individuals fail to strategically take into account that social partners respond in this way. Learning instead converges to a oneshot Nash equilibrium of a game with perceived rewards as payoffs. Evolution of bias can then compensate for the cognitive limitations of learning.", "authors": "Olof Leimar; John M.

However, lysosomal enzymes do not cross the bloodbrain barrier (BBB), and intravenous enzyme infusion is not effective for the brain. Lysosomal enzymes can be reengineered for BBB transport as IgGenzyme fusion proteins, where the IgG domain is a monoclonal antibody (MAb) against an endogenous BBB receptortransporter, and which acts as a molecular Trojan horse to deliver the enzyme to brain. However, the problem is retention of high enzyme activity following enzyme fusion to the IgG. The present investigation shows this is possible with a versatile approach that employs fusion of the enzyme to either the IgG heavy chain or light chain using a long flexible linker. The model IgG is a chimeric monoclonal antibody (MAb) against the human insulin receptor (HIR). The enzyme activity of the HIRMAbenzyme fusion protein is preserved for hexosaminidase A, which is mutated in Tay Sachs disease, for protein palmitoylthioesterase1, which is mutated in Batten disease type 1, acid sphingomyelinase, which is mutated in Niemann Pick disease type A, and beta galactosidase1, which is mutated in GM1 gangliosidosis.", "authors": "Ruben J.

In this work, we present the quantification and validation of a BeadBased Epitope Assay (BBEA) that through multiplexing of epitopes and multiple sample processing enables completion of large experiments in a short period of time, using minimal quantities of patients' blood. Peptides that are uniquely coupled to beads are incubated with serum or plasma samples, and after a secondary fluorophorelabeled antibody is added, the level of fluorescence is quantified with a Luminex reader. The signal is then normalized and converted to epitopespecific antibody binding values. We show that the effect of technical artifacts, i.e. well position or reading order, is minimal; and batch effects  different individual microplate runs  can be easily estimated and eliminated from the data. Epitopespecific antibody binding quantified with BBEA is highly reliable, reproducible and has greater sensitivity of epitope detection compared to peptide microarrays.

A cohort of 100 patients undergoing allogenic SCT for AML was retrospectively analyzed in a single institution. Patients without complete chimerism, defined as less than 0.01% of recipient's DNA in CD3negative cells, had a significantly higher risk of relapse and a lower overall survival (p  0.001).

Here, we present evidence of two low sealevel phases in the Maldives, Indian Ocean, based on fossil coral microatolls. Microatoll growth is constrained by low water levels and, consequently, they are robust recorders of past sea level. UTh dating of the Maldivian corals identified lowstands at ad 234605 and ad 14811807 when sea level fell to maximum depths of 0.88 m and 0.89 m respectively. These lowstands are synchronous with reductions in radiative forcing and sea surface temperature associated with the Late Antiquity Little Ice Age and the Little Ice Age. Our results provide highfidelity observations of lower sea levels during these cool periods and show rates of change of up to 4.24 mm yr1. Our data also confirm the acceleration of relative sealevel rise over the past two centuries and suggest that the current magnitude and rate of sealevel rise is not unprecedented.

Among the most commonly used models are transgenic mice overexpressing human amyloid precursor protein (APP) with mutations linked to familial AD, resulting in the formation of amyloid  plaques, one of the pathological hallmarks observed in AD patients. However, recent evidence suggests that the overexpression of APP by itself can confound some of the reported observations. Therefore, we investigated in the present study the AppNLGFmodel, an App knockin (AppKI) mouse model that develops amyloidosis in the absence of APPoverexpression. Our findings at the behavioral, electrophysiological, and histopathological level confirmed an agedependent increase in A142 levels and plaque deposition in these mice in accordance with previous reports. This had apparently no consequences on cognitive performance in a visual discrimination (VD) task, which was largely unaffected in AppNLGF mice at the ages tested. Additionally, we investigated neurophysiological functioning of several brain areas by phaseamplitude coupling (PAC) analysis, a measure associated with adequate cognitive functioning, during the VD task (starting at 4.5 months) and the exploration of home environment (at 5 and 8 months of age). While we did not detect agedependent changes in PAC during home environment exploration for both the wildtype and the AppNLGF mice, we did observe subtle changes in PAC in the wildtype mice that were not present in the AppNLGF mice.", "authors": "Sofia Jacob; Gethin Davies; Marijke De Bock; Bart Hermans; Cindy Wintmolders; Astrid Bottelbergs; Marianne Borgers; Clara Theunis; Bianca Van Broeck; Nikolay V.

Consequently, the genomic basis for colontoovary metastasis remains unstudied, due to limited available patients, and thus there have been no attempts to construct individualspecific networks. Due to its rarity, the small sample size makes common mutations difficult to find. To overcome this problem, we herein attempted to apply a biological connectivity map called a samplespecific network (SSN), to reveal common biological functions in three samples. Our three samples were compared to a clinical dataset contained in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) Colorectal Adenocarcinoma (COAD), showing different mutational spectra, compared to matched samples based on age, gender, microsatellite instability (MSI) status, and tumor, node, metastasis (TNM) stage. The SSNs for the three samples revealed significant correlations of the mutation statuses of several apoptosis genes, in contrast to the TCGAmatched samples. Further analysis of a targetedgene panel sequencing dataset for colontoovary metastasis of primary tumor samples also confirmed significant correlations of the mutational statuses among apoptosis genes. In summary, using SSN, we successfully identified a common function (apoptosis) among our three patients having colontoovary metastasis, despite no common mutations in the three patients.

Hence quantifying the molecular diffusion coefficient is important to determine whether there is an influence of biofilm microenvironment on the mobility of molecules. Here, we use single plane illumination microscopy fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (SPIMFCS) to obtain 3D diffusion coefficient maps with micrometre spatial and millisecond temporal resolution of entire Pseudomonas aeruginosa microcolonies. We probed how molecular properties such as size and charge as well as biofilm properties such as microcolony size and depth influence diffusion of fluorescently labelled dextrans inside biofilms. The 2 MDa dextran showed uneven penetration and a reduction in diffusion coefficient suggesting that the biofilm acts as a molecular sieve. Its diffusion coefficient was negatively correlated with the size of the microcolony. Positively charged dextran molecules and positively charged antibiotic tobramycin preferentially partitioned into the biofilm and remained mobile inside the microcolony, albeit with a reduced diffusion coefficient. Lastly, we measured changes of diffusion upon induction of dispersal and detected an increase in diffusion coefficient inside the biofilm before any loss of biomass. Thus, the change in diffusion is a proxy to detect early stages of dispersal. Our work shows that 3D diffusion maps are very sensitive to physiological changes in biofilms, viz. dispersal. However, this study also shows that diffusion, as mediated by the biofilm matrix, does not account for the high level of antibiotic tolerance associated with biofilms.", "authors": "Jagadish Sankaran; Nicholas J.

NIP45, a transcription factor regulating NFATc1 activity, mRNA was found to be induced in the Peripheral Blood mononuclear cells (PMBCs) of asthmatic preschool children with allergies and in the peripheral blood CD4 T cells from adult asthmatic patients. In PBMCs of asthmatic and control children, NIP45 mRNA directly correlated with NFATc1 but not with Tbet. Targeted deletion of NIP45 in mice resulted in a protective phenotype in experimental asthma with reduced airway mucus production, airway hyperresponsiveness and eosinophils. This phenotype was reversed by intranasal delivery of recombinant rIL33. Consistently, ILC2s and not GATA3 CD4 Tcells were decreased in the lungs of asthmatic NIP45 mice. Reduced cell number spleen ILC2s could be differentiated from NIP45 as compared to wildtype mice after in vivo injection of a microcircleDNA vector expressing IL25 and decreased cytokines and ILC2 markers in ILC2 differentiated from the bone marrow of NIP45 mice.

A controlled, randomized, crossover, singleblind, twotreatment, twoperiod, and two sequence clinical study of AFP (a single 75 mg dose) was conducted in 36 healthy Mexican volunteers who fulfilled the study requirements. Amfepramone plasma levels were measured using highperformance liquid chromatography mass spectrometry. Genotyping was performed using realtime PCR with TaqMan probes. Four AFP metabolizer phenotypes were found in our population: slow, normal, intermediate, and fast.

However, companion animals develop disease spontaneously in a way that mirrors disease development in humans. The purpose of this study is to develop a semantic and domainspecific method to enable construction of a data repository from a veterinary hospital that would be useful for future studies. We developed a twophase method that combines semantic and domainspecific approaches to construct a canine data repository of clinical data collected during routine care at the Matthew J Ryan Veterinary Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania (PennVet). Our framework consists of two phases: (1) a semantic datacleaning phase and (2) a domainspecific datacleaning phase. We validated our data repository using a gold standard of known breed predispositions for certain diseases (i.e., mitral valve disease, atrial fibrillation and osteosarcoma). Our twophase method allowed us to maximize data retention (99.8% of data retained), while ensuring the quality of our result. Our final population contained 84,405 dogs treated between 2000 and 2017 from 194 distinct dog breeds.

Here, we address the molecular evolution of the RCD1interactome. Using bioinformatics, its history was traced back more than 480 million years to the emergence of land plants with the RCD1binding short linear motif (SLiM) identified from mosses to flowering plants. SLiM variants were biophysically verified to be functional and to depend on the same RCD1 residues as the DREB2A transcription factor. Based on this, numerous additional members may be assigned to the RCD1interactome. Conservation was further strengthened by similar intrinsic disorder profiles of the transcription factor homologs. The unique structural plasticity of the RCD1interactome, with RCD1binding induced helix formation in DREB2A, but not detectable in ANAC046 or ANAC013, is apparently conserved. Thermodynamic analysis also indicated conservation with interchangeability between Arabidopsis and soybean RCD1 and DREB2A, although with finetuned coevolved binding interfaces. Interruption of conservation was observed, as moss DREB2 lacked the SLiM, likely reflecting differences in plant stress responses.

However, there are no reports of Hereditary Myotonia in pigs to date. Therefore, the objective of the present study was to characterize the clinical and molecular findings of Hereditary Myotonia in an inbred pedigree. The clinical, electromyographic, histopathological, and molecular findings were evaluated. Clinically affected pigs presented nondystrophic recessive Hereditary Myotonia. Nucleotide sequence analysis of the entire coding region of the CLCN1 gene revealed the absence of the exons 15 and 16 in myotonic animals. Analysis of the genomic region flanking the deletion unveiled a large intragenic deletion of 4,165 nucleotides. Interestingly, nonrelated, nonmyotonic pigs expressed transcriptional levels of an alternate transcript (i.e., X2) that was identical to the deleted X1 transcript of myotonic pigs. All myotonic pigs and their progenitors were homozygous recessive and heterozygous, respectively, for the 4,165nucleotide deletion. This is the first study reporting Hereditary Myotonia in pigs and characterizing its clinical and molecular findings.

The hippocampus expresses high levels of glucocorticoid (GR) and mineralocorticoid receptor (MR), and its development is affected by elevated fetal glucocorticoid levels. Antenatal sGC results in neuroendocrine and behavioral changes that persist in three generations of female guinea pig offspring of the paternal lineage. We hypothesized that antenatal sGC results in transgenerational changes in gene expression that correlate with changes in DNA methylation. We used RNASeq and capture probe bisulfite sequencing to investigate the transcriptomic and epigenomic effects of antenatal sGC exposure in the hippocampus of three generations of juvenile female offspring from the paternal lineage. Antenatal sGC exposure (F0 pregnancy) resulted in generationspecific changes in hippocampal gene transcription and DNA methylation. Significant changes in individual CpG methylation occurred in RNApol II binding regions of small noncoding RNA (snRNA) genes, which implicates alternative splicing as a mechanism involved in transgenerational transmission of the effects of antenatal sGC.

Nevertheless, the molecular mechanism responsible for this observation has not been elucidated to this date. In the present study we show that IP3R associates to STIM1 upon depletion of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) by activation of the inositol trisphosphate signaling cascade via Gprotein coupled receptors. IP3RSTIM1 association results in enhanced STIM1 puncta formation and larger Oraimediated wholecell currents as well as increased calcium influx. Depleting the ER with a calcium ATPase inhibitor (thapsigargin, TG) does not induce IP3RSTIM1 association, indicating that this association requires an active IP3R. The IP3RSTIM1 association is only observed after IP3R activation, as evidenced by FRET experiments and coimmunoprecipitation assays. ER intraluminal calcium measurements using MagFluo4 showed enhanced calcium depletion when IP3R is overexpressed. A STIM1GCaMP fusion protein indicates that STIM1 detects lower calcium concentrations near its EFhand domain when IP3R is overexpressed when compared with the fluorescence reported by a GCaMP homogenously distributed in the ER lumen (ERGCaMP). All these data together strongly suggest that activation of inositol trisphosphate signaling cascade induces the formation of the IP3RSTIM1 complex.

To address this discoverytofunction gap, we developed a sequence driven:activitybased hybrid approach for screening venom peptides that is amenable to largevenom peptide libraries with minimal amounts of peptide. Using this approach, we characterized the physiological and behavioral phenotypes of two peptides from the venom of predatory terebrid marine snails, teretoxins Tv1 from Terebra variegata and Tsu1.1 from Terebra subulata.

In a free choice task, headrestrained marmosets prefer objects gazed at by a conspecific and, moreover, they exhibit considerably shorter choice reaction times for the same objects.

We estimate 10  10 G matrices for five morphological traits expressed in both sexes. We find lowtomoderate heritabilities (average 0.36), mostly large crosssex correlations (average 0.54) and moderate betweentrait correlations (average 0.34). G matrices differ significantly among species with wing length contributing most to these differences. Wing length is the trait that is most divergent among species, suggesting it has been under selection during species divergence. The more distantly related species, Pseudochorthippus parallelus, was the most different in the shape of G. Projection of contemporary genetic variation into the divergence space D illustrates that the major axis of genetic variation in Gomphocerippus rufus is aligned with divergence from Chorthippus biguttulus, while the major axis of genetic variation in neither of the species is aligned with the divergence between Pseudochorthippus parallelus and the other two species. Our results demonstrate significant differences in G matrices with a phylogenetic signal in the differentiation.", "authors": "Anasuya Chakrabarty; Holger Schielzeth", "keywords": "Evolutionary genetics; Quantitative trait", "organization_affiliated": "Department of Evolutionary Biology, Bielefeld University, Bielefeld, Germany; Population Ecology Group, Institute of Ecology and Evolution, Friedrich Schiller University, Jena, Germany; Department of Evolutionary Biology, Bielefeld University, Bielefeld, Germany; Population Ecology Group, Institute of Ecology and Evolution, Friedrich Schiller University, Jena, Germany"}

We investigated the phenotype of the TMEM127 tumor suppressor gene deficiency in vivo. Wholebody Tmem127 knockout mice have decreased adiposity and maintain insulin sensitivity, low hepatic fat deposition and peripheral glucose clearance after a highfat diet. Liverspecific and adiposespecific Tmem127 deletion partially overlap global Tmem127 loss: liver Tmem127 promotes hepatic gluconeogenesis and inhibits peripheral glucose uptake, while adipose Tmem127 downregulates adipogenesis and hepatic glucose production. mTORC2 is activated in TMEM127deficient hepatocytes suggesting that it interacts with TMEM127 to control insulin sensitivity. Murine hepatic Tmem127 expression is increased in insulinresistant states and is reversed by diet or the insulin sensitizer pioglitazone. Importantly, human liver TMEM127 expression correlates with steatohepatitis and insulin resistance. Our results suggest that besides tumor suppression activities, TMEM127 is a nutrientsensing component of glucoselipid homeostasis and may be a target in insulin resistance. TMEM127 is a tumor suppressor protein, loss of which predisposes to catecholaminesecreting tumors.

Traitbased approaches may provide such understanding, because it is the traits and adaptations of species that determine which environments they can inhabit. It is therefore important to identify key traits that determine species distributions and investigate how these traits relate to the environment. Based on scientific bottomtrawl surveys of marine fish abundances and traits of 1,200 species, we investigate traitenvironment relationships and project the trait composition of marine fish communities across the continental shelf seas of the Northern hemisphere. We show that traits related to growth, maturation and lifespan respond most strongly to the environment. This is reflected by a pronounced \"fastslow continuum\" of fish lifehistories, revealing that traits vary with temperature at large spatial scales, but also with depth and seasonality at more local scales. Our findings provide insight into the structure of marine fish communities and suggest that global warming will favour an expansion of fastliving species. Knowledge of the global and local drivers of trait distributions can thus be used to predict future responses of fish communities to environmental change.", "authors": "Esther Beukhof; Romain Frelat; Laurene Pecuchet; Aurore Maureaud; Tim Spaanheden Dencker; Jon Solmundsson; Antonio Punzon; Raul Primicerio; Manuel Hidalgo; Christian Mollmann; Martin Lindegren", "keywords": "Biodiversity; Biogeography; Fisheries; Macroecology; Marine biology", "organization_affiliated": "Centre for Ocean Life, National Institute of Aquatic Resources (DTU Aqua), Technical University of Denmark, Kongens Lyngby, Denmark; Institute of Marine Ecosystem and Fisheries Science, Center for Earth System Research and Sustainability (CEN), University of Hamburg, Hamburg, Germany; Centre for Ocean Life, National Institute of Aquatic Resources (DTU Aqua), Technical University of Denmark, Kongens Lyngby, Denmark; Norwegian College of Fishery Science, UiT, The Arctic University of Norway, Troms, Norway; Centre for Ocean Life, National Institute of Aquatic Resources (DTU Aqua), Technical University of Denmark, Kongens Lyngby, Denmark; Centre for Ocean Life, National Institute of Aquatic Resources (DTU Aqua), Technical University of Denmark, Kongens Lyngby, Denmark; Marine and Freshwater Research Institute, Reykjavik, Iceland; Instituto Espanol de Oceanografia, Centro Oceanografico de Santander, Santander, Spain; Norwegian College of Fishery Science, UiT, The Arctic University of Norway, Troms, Norway; Instituto Espanol de Oceanografia, Centre Oceanografic de les Balears, Ecosystem Oceanography Group (GRECO), Palma de Mallorca, Spain; Institute of Marine Ecosystem and Fisheries Science, Center for Earth System Research and Sustainability (CEN), University of Hamburg, Hamburg, Germany; Centre for Ocean Life, National Institute of Aquatic Resources (DTU Aqua), Technical University of Denmark, Kongens Lyngby, Denmark"}

Understanding the mechanism of PafBC activation is impeded by a lack of structural information on this transcription factor that contains a widespread, but poorly understood WYL domain frequently encountered in bacterial transcription factors. Here, we determine the crystal structure of Arthrobacter aurescens PafBC. The protein consists of two modules, each harboring an Nterminal helixturnhelix DNAbinding domain followed by a central WYL and a Cterminal extension (WCX) domain. The WYL domains exhibit Smfolds, while the WCX domains adopt ferredoxinlike folds, both characteristic for RNAbinding proteins. Our results suggest a mechanism of regulation in which WYL domaincontaining transcription factors may be activated by binding RNA or other nucleic acid molecules. Using an in vivo mutational screen in Mycobacterium smegmatis, we identify potential coactivator binding sites on PafBC. The transcriptional activator PafBC is a regulator of mycobacterial DNA damage response and upregulates genes involved in DNA repair. Here, the authors present the crystal structure of Arthrobacter aurescens PafBC and suggest that PafBC might be activated by binding of a nucleic acid ligand, and bioinformatics analysis shows that its central WYL domain is a widespread feature in bacterial transcription factors.", "authors": "Andreas U.

By contrast, thermal conductivity (thermal effusivity) increases up to 45% (40%) as the metallic phase emerges in the VO2 structure due to the insulatortometal transition, and it enhances up to 11% (25%) in the insulator state when the local rutile phase is induced by the tungsten doping. (iii) The characteristic peak of the VO2 specific heat capacity is observed in both heating and cooling processes, such that the phase transition of the 0.8 at.% Wdoped sample requires about 24% less thermal energy than the undoped one. (iv) The impact of the W doping on the four abovementioned thermal properties of VO2 mainly shows up in its insulator phase, as a result of the distortion of the local lattice induced by the electrons of tungsten.

In this retrospective, observational study, we collected data from 20 patients (20 eyes) with diabetic retinopathy. Subjects were imaged with the SSOCTA system (PLEX Elite 9000, Carl Zeiss Meditec Inc., Dublin, CA, USA). The OCTA volume data were processed with a volume projection removal algorithm and then exported to imageJ in order to obtain a 3D visualization of the analyzed MAs. The rotational threedimensional OCTA images were qualitatively and quantitatively investigated. A total of 52 MAs were included in the analysis. On rotational 3D OCTA images, the number of vessels associated with each MA varied between 1 and 4, and most MAs (59.6%) were associated with 2 vessels. Moreover, in 20 MAs (38.4%) these vessels seem to originate from the SCP, while 26 MAs (50.0%) had associated vessels originating from the DVC, and 6 MAs had associated vessels arising from both the SCP and DVC (11.6%). Most MAs (3152) had a 'saccular' shape. The number of retinal layers occupied by each MA ranged between 1 and 3 and the inner nuclear layer was the retinal layer most frequently occupied by MAs. In conclusion, this study used an algorithm to obtain rotational threedimensional visualization of retinal MAs. The MAs' architecture is complex and 3D visualization may clarify the true vascular origin of these lesions, which is often mistaken using en face OCTA images.", "authors": "Enrico Borrelli; Riccardo Sacconi; Maria Brambati; Francesco Bandello; Giuseppe Querques", "keywords": "Diabetes complications; Retinal diseases", "organization_affiliated": "Department of Ophthalmology, University VitaSalute, IRCCS Ospedale San Raffaele, Milan, Italy; Department of Ophthalmology, University VitaSalute, IRCCS Ospedale San Raffaele, Milan, Italy; Department of Ophthalmology, University VitaSalute, IRCCS Ospedale San Raffaele, Milan, Italy; Department of Ophthalmology, University VitaSalute, IRCCS Ospedale San Raffaele, Milan, Italy; Department of Ophthalmology, University VitaSalute, IRCCS Ospedale San Raffaele, Milan, Italy"}

We show experimentally and confirm theoretically that the NbNi interface plays an essential role in the electron transport through the device. Just below the superconducting transition, a strong inverse proximity effect from the nanowire suppresses superconducting correlations at NbNi interfaces, resulting in a conventional anisotropic magnetoresistive response. At lower temperatures however, the Nb electrodes operate as superconducting shunts. As the result, the magnetoresistance exhibits a strongly growing hysteretic behavior accompanied by a series of sawlike jumps. The latter are associated with the penetrationescape of individual Abrikosov vortices that influence nonequilibrium processes at the NbNi interface.

BMSCs are chemotactically guided towards the cancer cells and contribute to the formation of a cancer microenvironment. The homing of BMSCs was affected by various factors. Disseminated tumour cells (DTCs) in distant organs, especially in the bone marrow, are the source of cancer metastasis and cancer relapse. DTC survival is also determined by the microenvironment. Here we aim to elucidate how cancereducated BMSCs promote the survival of cancer cells at primary tumour sites and distant sites. We highlight the dynamic change by identifying different gene expression signatures in intratumoral BMSCs and in BMSCs that move back in the bone marrow. Intratumoral BMSCs acquire high mobility and displayed immunosuppressive effects. Intratumoral BMSCs that ultimately home to the bone marrow exhibit a strong immunosuppressive function. Cancereducated BMSCs promote the survival of lung cancer cells via expansion of MDSCs in bone marrow, primary tumour sites and metastatic sites. These Ly6G MDSCs suppress proliferation of T cells. CXCL5, nitric oxide and GMCSF produced by cancereducated BMSCs contribute to the formation of malignant microenvironments. Treatment with CXCL5 antibody, the iNOS inhibitor 1400w and GMCSF antibody reduced MDSC expansion in the bone marrow, primary tumour sites and metastatic sites, and promoted the efficiency of PDL1 antibody. Our study reveals that cancereducated BMSCs are the component of the niche for primary lung cancer cells and DTCs, and that they can be the target for immunotherapy.", "authors": "Buqing Sai; Yafei Dai;

Yet it remains unclear how encoding of joint movement in M1 depends on varying environmental contexts. Using calcium imaging we measured neuronal activity in layer 23 of the M1 forelimb region while mice grasped regularly or irregularly spaced ladder rungs during locomotion. We found that population coding of forelimb joint movements is sparse and varies according to the flexibility demanded from individual joints in the regular and irregular context, even for equivalent grasping actions across conditions. This contextdependence of M1 encoding emerged during task learning, fostering higher precision of grasping actions, but broke apart upon silencing of projections from secondary motor cortex (M2). These findings suggest that M1 exploits information from M2 to adapt encoding of joint movements to the flexibility demands of distinct familiar contexts, thereby increasing the accuracy of motor output. Network activity in primary motor cortex (M1) controls dexterous limb movements. Here, the authors show that the M1 population code varies according to contextual motor demands that are conveyed via the secondary motor cortex (M2).", "authors": "Wolfgang Omlor; AnnaSophia Wahl; Pia Sipila; Henry Lutcke; Balazs Laurenczy; IWen Chen; Lazar T.

In particular, new experiments have to be planned in unexplored regions of the operational space. As a consequence, care must be taken because the input quantities used to train and test the performance of the analysis tools are not necessarily sampled by the same probability distribution as in the final applications. The regressors and dependent variables cannot therefore be assumed to verify the i.i.d. (independent and identical distribution) hypothesis and learning has therefore to take place under non stationary conditions. In the present paper, a new data driven methodology is proposed to guide planning of experiments, to explore the operational space and to optimise performance. The approach is based on the falsification of existing models. The deployment of Symbolic Regression via Genetic Programming to the available data is used to identify a set of candidate models, using the method of the Pareto Frontier. The confidence intervals for the predictions of such models are then used to find the best region of the parameter space for their falsification, where the next set of experiments can be most profitably carried out.

Accumulated lipids are catabolized to meet energy requirements during dormancy (diapause), which occurs during the last copepodite stage (C5). The current knowledge of lipid degradation pathways during diapause termination is limited. We characterized changes in lipid fullness and generated transcriptional profiles in C5s during termination of diapause and progression towards adulthood. Lipid fullness of C5s declined linearly during developmental progression, but more oxidation genes were upregulated in early C5s compared to late C5s and adults. We identified four possible master regulators of energy metabolism, which all were generally upregulated in early C5s, compared to late C5s and adults. We discovered that one of two enzymes in the carnitine shuttle is absent from the calanoid copepod lineage. Based on the geographical location of the sampling site, the fieldsamples were initially presumed to consist of C. finmarchicus.

Employing comprehensive computational simulations and theoretical analyses, we determine the spatiotemporal characteristics of the neural fields and the required key performance parameters of an NV magnetometrybased imaging setup. We investigate how the technical parameters determine the achievable spatial resolution for an optimal 2D reconstruction of neural currents from the measured field distributions.

To date, the genetic basis of the quantitative variations for these potentially beneficial compounds has been limited.

Metabolic profiling of grapevine stems was performed using liquid chromatographyhighresolution mass spectrometry (LCHRMS), resulting in the detection of 1317 ionsfeatures. In total, 19 of these features matched with literaturereported stilbenoid masses and were genetically mapped using a 1449SNP linkage map and Rqtl software, resulting in the identification of four mQTLs. Two largeeffect mQTLs that corresponded to a stilbenoid dimer and a trimer were mapped on chromosome 18, accounting for phenotypic variances of 29.0% and 38.4%. Functional annotations of these largeeffect mQTLs on the VitisNet network database revealed a major hotspot of diseaseresistance motifs on chromosome 18. This 2.8Mbp region contains 48 genes with Rgene motifs, including variants of TIR, NBS, and LRR, that might potentially confer resistance to powdery mildew, downy mildew, or other pathogens. The locus also encompasses genes associated with flavonoid and biosynthetic pathways that are likely involved in the production of secondary metabolites, including phytoalexins. In addition, haplotype dosage effects of the five mQTLs further characterized the genomic regions for differential production of stilbenoids that can be applied in resistance breeding through manipulation of stilbenoid production in planta.", "authors": "Soon L.

Although its clinical presentation and radiographic findings are similar to other nutrient deficiencies, practitioners often fail to diagnose copper deficiency. This report describes a case of copper deficiency decades after a jejunoileal bypass (JIB) to draw attention to potential longterm sequelae associated with this now abandoned procedure. A 67yearold female presented with bilateral paresthesias of her hands and legs, accompanied by gait instability and frequent falls. The individual had a significant history of malabsorption and malnutrition related to a 40 years prior JIB for weight loss. MRI demonstrated T2 hyperintense signal in the dorsal spinal cord between C3 and C5. She was found to have copper deficiency, underwent IV repletion, prescribed oral repletion, and was discharged home. She subsequently developed progressive symptoms over the following year and remained unable to function at home. Treatment required inpatient copper repletion followed by inpatient rehabilitation. Following rehabilitation, the individual demonstrated significant improved independence. Although JIB surgery is not currently performed, it is important to recognize the metabolic consequences of nutrient deficiencies related to this procedure and the potential for the development of neurological sequelae including myelopathy. Furthermore, additional causes of copper deficiency to consider in cases of undifferentiated myelopathy include congenital metabolic syndromes, zinc toxicity, and malabsorption. This case demonstrates the potential of intensive physical and occupational therapy regimens, along with symptomatic treatment and nutrient repletion, to help an individual regain independence and improve activities of daily living.", "authors": "Shawn Joshi; Mitra McLarney; Benjamin Abramoff", "keywords": "Malnutrition; Peripheral neuropathies; Rehabilitation", "organization_affiliated": "School of Biomedical Engineering, Science  Health Systems, Drexel University, Philadelphia, USA; College of Medicine, Drexel University, Philadelphia, USA; Department of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, USA; Department of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, USA"}

In a human umbilical endothelial cell (HUVEC)neuron coculture assay, we found that HUVECs reduced apoptosis of neurons under OGD, and this effect was compromised by GW4869, a blocker of exosome release. Purified EVs could be internalized by neurons and alleviate neuronal apoptosis under OGD. A miRNA, miR1290, was highly enriched in HUVECsderived EVs and was responsible for EVmediated neuronal protection under OGD. Interestingly, we found that OGD enhanced intake of EVs by neurons cultured in vitro. We examined the expression of several potential receptors for EV intake and found that caveolin1 (Cav1) was upregulated in OGDtreated neurons and mice suffering from middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). Knockdown of Cav1 in neurons reduced EV intake, and canceled EVmediated neuronal protection under OGD. HUVECderived EVs alleviated MCAOinduced neuronal apoptosis in vivo.

This appears due to elevated actin binding propensity in podocytes resulting in a 'frozen' cytoskeleton. What is challenging is how this cellular behavior would be compatible with other cell functions that rely on cytoskeleton plasticity. Our previous finding revealed that wild type ACTN4 can be phosphorylated at tyrosine 4 and 31 upon stimulation by epidermal growth factor (EGF) to reduce the binding to actin cytoskeleton. We queried whether the elevated actin binding activity of FSGS mutants can be downregulated by EGFmediated phosphorylation, to discern a mechanism by which the actincytoskeleton can be released in FSGS. In this manuscript, we first constructed variants with Y431E to mimic the phosphorylation at tyrosines 4 and 31 based on earlier modeling simulations that predicted that this would bury the actin binding domains and lead to a decrease in actin binding activity. We found that Y431E significantly reduced the actin binding activity of K255E, T259I and S262P, dramatically preventing them from aggregating in, and inhibiting motility of, podocytes, fibroblasts and melanoma cells. A putative kinase target site at Y265 in the actin binding domain was also generated as a phosphomimetic ACTN4 Y265E that demonstrated even greater binding to actin filaments than K255E and the other FSGS mutants. That the tyrosine kinase regulation of FSGS mutation binding to actin filaments can occur in cells was shown by phosphorylation on Y4 and Y31 of the K225E after extended exposure of cells to EGF, with a decrease in ACTN4 aggregates in fibroblasts. These findings will provide evidence for targeting the Ntermini of FSGS ACTN4 mutants to downregulate their actin binding activities for ameliorating the glomerulosclerotic phenotype of patients.", "authors": "Hanshuang Shao; Bentley Wingert; Astrid Weins; Martin R.

However, in the relativelyisolated regions of southern South America there have been no comprehensive studies to assess disease transmission risks between domestic cats and forestdwelling wild felids such as guigna (Leopardus guigna). We evaluated hemoplasma infection and the possibility of transmission between domestic cats and guignas by comparing spatial and phylogenetic patterns of pathogen prevalence. Bloodspleen samples were collected from 102 wild guignas and 262 cooccurring rural domestic cats across the entire distribution range of guigna in Chile. Hemoplasma infection was assessed by direct sequencing of the 16S RNA gene. Infection with hemoplasmas was common and geographically widespread across different bioclimatic areas for both species. The most common feline Mycoplasma species in guigna and domestic cats were Candidatus M. haemominutum (CMhm) (15.7% guigna; 10.3% domestic cat) and Mycoplasma haemofelis (Mhf) (9.8% guigna, 6.1% domestic cat). A previously undescribed Mycoplasma sp. sequence was found in two guignas and one cat. Continuous forestlandscapes were associated with higher hemoplasmaprevalence in guignas. Shared hemoplasma nucleotide sequence types between guigna and domestic cats were rare, suggesting that crossspecies transmission between guignas and domestic cats may occur, but is probably uncommon. Ectoparasites, which have been linked with hemoplasma transmission, were not found on guignas and were infrequent on domestic cats.

Here, we reveal that Lplastin (LPL), an established tumor marker, is reversibly regulated by ROSinduced thiol oxidation on Cys101, which forms a disulfide bridge with Cys42. LPL reduction is mediated by the Thioredoxin1 (TRX1) system, as shown by TRX1 trapping, TRX1 knockdown and blockade of Thioredoxin1 reductase (TRXR1) with auranofin. LPL oxidation diminishes its actinbundling capacity. Ratiometric imaging using an LPLroGFPOrp1 fusion protein and a dimedonebased proximity ligation assay (PLA) reveal that LPL oxidation occurs primarily in actinbased cellular extrusions and strongly inhibits cell spreading and filopodial extension formation in tumor cells. This effect is accompanied by decreased tumor cell migration, invasion and extracellular matrix (ECM) degradation. Since LPL oxidation occurs following treatment of tumors with auranofin or irradiation, it may be a molecular mechanism contributing to the effectiveness of tumor treatment with redoxaltering therapies. The actinremodelling protein Lplastin promotes tumour migration and invasion. Here, the authors show that Lplastin is regulated spatially by ROSinduced thiol oxidation which inhibits its actinbundling function and cell spreading and filopodial extension formation in tumor cells.", "authors": "Emre Balta; Robert Hardt; Jie Liang; Henning Kirchgessner; Christian Orlik; Beate Jahraus; Stefan Hillmer; Stefan Meuer; Katrin Hubner; Guido H.

Complicating the identification of targets of positive selection in modern human populations is their complex demographic history, characterized by population bottlenecks and expansions, population structure, migration, and admixture. In particular, founder effects and recent strong population size reductions, such as those experienced by the indigenous peoples of the Americas, have severe impacts on genetic variation that can lead to the accumulation of large allele frequency differences between populations due to genetic drift rather than natural selection. While distinguishing the effects of demographic history from selection remains challenging, neglecting neutral processes can lead to the incorrect identification of candidate loci. We here review the recent population genomic insights into the genetic basis of arsenic tolerance in Andean populations, and utilize this example to highlight both the difficulties pertaining to the identification of local adaptations in strongly bottlenecked populations, as well as the importance of controlling for demographic history in selection scans.", "authors": "Mario Apata; Susanne P.

In the present work, we obtained an expression profile of circRNAs in dorsal root ganglions (DRGs) after rat sciatic nerve crush injury by RNA sequencing (RNASeq) and found the expression level of circSpidr was obviously increased using quantitative realtime polymerase chain reaction (qRTPCR). Furthermore, circSpidr was proved to be a circular RNA enriched in the cytoplasm of DRG neurons. Through in vitro and in vivo experiments, we determined that downregulation of circSpidr could suppress axon regeneration of DRG neurons after sciatic nerve injury partially through modulating PI3KAkt signaling pathway.

Alternative splicing is a key mechanism for the expansion of molecular repertoires, and protein splice isoforms shape neuronal cell surface recognition and function. However, the logic of how alternative splicing programs are arrayed across neuronal cells types is poorly understood. We systematically mapped ribosomeassociated transcript isoforms in genetically defined neuron types of the mouse forebrain. Our dataset provides an extensive resource of transcript diversity across major neuron classes. We find that neuronal transcript isoform profiles reliably distinguish even closely related classes of pyramidal cells and inhibitory interneurons in the mouse hippocampus and neocortex. These highly specific alternative splicing programs selectively control synaptic proteins and intrinsic neuronal properties. Thus, transcript diversification via alternative splicing is a central mechanism for the functional specification of neuronal cell types and circuits.

Moreover, we found that MYCN mediated the folate cycle via MTHFD2, which contributed onecarbon unit to enhance purine synthesis, and further regulated nucleotide production by PAICS in response to cancer progression. Dual knockdown of the MYCNtargeted gene pair, MTHFD2 and PAICS, in MNA neuroblastoma cells synergically reduced cell proliferation, colony formation, migration ability, and DNA synthesis. By systematically screening the compound perturbagens, the gene expression levels of MTHFD2 and PAICS were specifically suppressed by anisomycin and apicidin across cell lines, and our cotreatment results also displayed synergistic inhibition of MNA neuroblastoma cell proliferation.

Here, we show that intranasal administration of live or killed pneumococci to mice generates pneumococcusresponsive IL17Aproducing CD4 mucosal TRM. Furthermore, we show that these cells are sufficient to mediate longlived, neutrophildependent protection against subsequent pneumococcal nasal challenge. Unexpectedly, and in contrast with the prevailing paradigm, we found that parenteral administration of killed pneumococci also generates protective IL17ACD4 TRM in the nasal mucosa.

The plasma FE and urinary free FE (UFFUFE) ratios correlated significantly only in patients with the normal function of 5 and 5reductase. The increased function of 11HSD2 was noted in all preeclamptic pregnancies. Increased function of 5 and 5reductase was specific only for SGAPE pregnancies, and the function of 5reductase was dependent on fetal sex. The SGANT pregnancies with male fetuses trended towards the higher function of renal 11HSD2 and 5reductase; SGANT pregnancies with female fetuses lacked any systemic glucocorticoid imbalance. In conclusion, systemic metabolism of F is the most intensive in preeclamptic pregnancies complicated by SGA with female fetuses. Our study supports the hypothesis about the different origins of PE and idiopathic intrauterine growth restriction and suggests the sexspecific mechanisms responsible for fetal growth restriction.", "authors": "Anna Siemiatkowska; Katarzyna Kosicka; Agata SzperaGozdziewicz; Mariola Krzyscin; Grzegorz H.

However, these methods may often not be used to assess agreement, and when used, they are not always presented or interpreted correctly. Our objective was to evaluate the use and the quality of reporting of BlandAltman analyses in studies that compare selfreported with measured weight and height. We evaluated the use of BlandAltman methods in 394 published articles that compared selfreported and measured weight and height data for adolescents or adults. Six reporting criteria were developed: assessment of the normality of the distribution of differences, a complete and correctly labeled BlandAltman plot displaying the mean difference and limits of agreement (LOA), numerical values and confidence intervals, standard errors, or standard deviations for mean difference, numerical values of LOA, confidence intervals for LOA, and prespecified criteria for acceptable LOA. Only 72394 (18%) studies comparing selfreported with measured weight and height or BMI used some form of BlandAltman analyses. No study using BlandAltman analyses satisfied more than four of the six criteria. Of the 72 studies, 64 gave mean differences along with confidence intervals or standard deviations, 55 provided complete BlandAltman plots that were appropriately labeled and described, 37 provided numerical values for LOA, 4 reported that they examined the normality of the distribution of differences, 3 provided confidence intervals for LOA, and 3 had prespecified criteria for agreement. BlandAltman methods appear to be infrequently used in studies comparing measured with selfreported weight, height, or BMI, and key information is missing in many of those that do use BlandAltman methods. Future directions would be defining acceptable LOA values and improving the reporting and application of BlandAltman methods in studies of selfreported anthropometry.", "authors": "Katherine M.

Using conditional knockout mouse models, we found in the current study that loss of polarity protein Par3 increases prostatic epithelial cell growth, elevates symmetrical cell divisions in basal cells, and randomizes spindle orientation in luminal cells, causing the development of highgrade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN). Mechanistically, loss of Par3 dissociates the Par3merlinLats1 complex, consequently inhibiting phosphorylation of Lats1 to attenuate the Hippo pathway. Furthermore, attenuated Hippo pathway enhances nuclear translocation of Yesassociated protein (YAP), which promotes cell proliferation and symmetrical cell divisions through transcriptional activation of Ki67 and Sox2. In addition, Lats1 dephosphorylation impairs its interaction with G protein signaling modulator 2 (GPSM2, which is also known as LGN) that causes randomization of spindle orientation in luminal cells. Interestingly, codeletion of Par3 and Lats1 for complete blockade of the Hippo pathway in mice results in prostate tumor initiation, whereas codeletion of Par3 and YAP for disrupting YAP nuclear translocation reverses the phenotypes to a relatively normal state. Therefore, our findings highlight combination of Par3 loss and blockade of the Hippo pathway as a novel mechanism for prostatic tumorigenesis.", "authors": "PeiJie Zhou; Xiao Wang; Na An; Lianzi Wei; Long Zhang; Xingxu Huang; Helen He Zhu; YuXiang Fang; WeiQiang Gao", "keywords": "Cancer models; Prostate cancer", "organization_affiliated": "State Key Laboratory of Oncogenes and Related Genes, RenjiMed X Clinical Stem Cell Research Center, Ren Ji Hospital, School of Medicine, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China; State Key Laboratory of Oncogenes and Related Genes, RenjiMed X Clinical Stem Cell Research Center, Ren Ji Hospital, School of Medicine, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China; State Key Laboratory of Oncogenes and Related Genes, RenjiMed X Clinical Stem Cell Research Center, Ren Ji Hospital, School of Medicine, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China; State Key Laboratory of Oncogenes and Related Genes, RenjiMed X Clinical Stem Cell Research Center, Ren Ji Hospital, School of Medicine, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China; Life Sciences Institute and Innovation Center for Cell Signalling Network, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China; School of Life Science and Technology, ShanghaiTech University, Shanghai, China; State Key Laboratory of Oncogenes and Related Genes, RenjiMed X Clinical Stem Cell Research Center, Ren Ji Hospital, School of Medicine, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China; State Key Laboratory of Oncogenes and Related Genes, RenjiMed X Clinical Stem Cell Research Center, Ren Ji Hospital, School of Medicine, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China; State Key Laboratory of Oncogenes and Related Genes, RenjiMed X Clinical Stem Cell Research Center, Ren Ji Hospital, School of Medicine, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China; School of Biomedical Engineering  MedX Research Institute, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China"}

Traditional surrogate testing subscribes to statistical hypothesis testing and investigates potential differences in discriminant statistics between the given empirical sample and its surrogate counterparts. The choice and estimation of the discriminant statistics can be challenging across short time series. Also, conclusion based on a single empirical sample is an inherent limitation. The present study proposes a recurrent neural network classification framework that uses the raw time series obviating the need for discriminant statistic while accommodating multiple time series realizations for enhanced generalizability of the findings. The results are demonstrated on short time series with lengths (L  32, 64, 128) from continuous and discrete dynamical systems in chaotic regimes, nonlinear transform of linearly correlated noise and experimental data. Accuracy of the classifier is shown to be markedly higher than 50% for the processes in chaotic regimes whereas those of nonlinearly correlated noise were around ~50% similar to that of random guess from a onesample binomial test.

However, the presence of speckle noise affects the quality of OCT images and its interpretation. Although recent frameaveraging techniques have shown to enhance OCT image quality, they require longer scanning durations, resulting in patient discomfort. Using a custom deep learning network trained with 2,328 'clean Bscans' (multiframe Bscans; signal averaged), and their corresponding 'noisy Bscans' (clean Bscans  Gaussian noise), we were able to successfully denoise 1,552 unseen singleframe (without signal averaging) Bscans. The denoised Bscans were qualitatively similar to their corresponding multiframe Bscans, with enhanced visibility of the ONH tissues. The mean signal to noise ratio (SNR) increased from 4.02  0.68 dB (singleframe) to 8.14  1.03 dB (denoised). For all the ONH tissues, the mean contrast to noise ratio (CNR) increased from 3.50  0.56 (singleframe) to 7.63  1.81 (denoised). The mean structural similarity index (MSSIM) increased from 0.13  0.02 (single frame) to 0.65  0.03 (denoised) when compared with the corresponding multiframe Bscans.

To examine this further, we utilized an in vitro assay to measure dicer activity in lepidopteran and dipteran cells, combined with baculoviruses expressing the RNAi suppressor B2 from Flock House virus or Aedes aegypti dicer2 (Aedicer2) using a constitutive heat shock promoter. Addition of cell lysates containing baculovirusexpressed B2 to lysates from dipteran (S2, Aag2) or lepidopteran (Sf9) cells inhibited endogenous dicer activity in a dosedependent manner, while expression of Aedicer2 restored siRNA production in Ae. albopictus C636 cells, which are dicer2 defective. However, B2 expression from the constitutive heat shock promoter had no impact on baculovirus replication or virulence in cell lines or larvae that were either highly permissive (Trichoplusia ni) or less susceptible (Spodoptera frugiperda) to infection. We determined that this constitutive level of B2 expression had little to no ability to suppress dicer activity in cell lysates, but higher expression of B2, following heat shock treatment, inhibited dicer activity in all cells tested. Thus, we cannot rule out the possibility that optimized expression of B2 or other RNAi suppressors may increase baculovirus replication and expression of heterologous proteins by baculoviruses.", "authors": "Jeffrey J.

Our approach utilizes multiple complementary types of information, specifically cellular phenotypes, cellular locations, functions, and whole body physiological phenotypes as features. We demonstrate that our method can accurately identify known cancer driver genes and distinguish between their role in different types of cancer.

In contrast, the fungal densities were positively correlated with the root knot score. Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) results showed that the combination of S. rubrogriseus HDZ947 and biofumigation enriched beneficial microbes and reduced certain soilborne fungal phytopathogens, thereby enhancing the efficacies of both S. rubrogriseus HDZ947 and biofumigation against M. incognita. And HDZ947 could colonize in soil. The total abundance of nematode and plant parasites, the ratio of soil fungivore nematode to fungivore plus bacterivore nematode, and the nematode diversity indices all decreased with the combination treatment.

Alongside nanoscale topographical information, the technique reveals local variations in thermal conductivity of this elegant natural material. We observe that at the tissue scale, fibre cells in the scattered vascular tissue would offer preferential pathways for heat transport due to their higher conductivities in both anatomical directions, in comparison to parenchymatic cells in ground tissue. In addition, the transverse orientation offers more resistance to heat flow. Furthermore, we observe each fibre cell to compose of up to ten layers, with alternating thick and thin lamellae in the secondary wall. Notably, we find the thin lamellae to have relatively lower conductivity than the thick lamellae in the fibre direction. This is due to the distinct orientation of cellulose microfibrils within the cell wall layers, and that cellulose microfibrils are highly anisotropic and have higher conductivity along their lengths. Microfibrils in the thick lamellae are oriented almost parallel to the fibre cell axis, while microfibrils in the thin lamellae are oriented almost perpendicular to the cell axis. Bamboo grasses have evolved to rapidly deposit this combination of thick and thin layers, like a polymer composite laminate or crosslaminated timber, for combination of axial and transverse stiffness and strength. However, this architecture is found to have interesting implications on thermal transport in bamboo, which is relevant for the application of engineered bamboo in buildings.

Unlike many other forms of frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD), svPPA has a highly consistent underlying pathology composed of TDP43 (a regulator of RNA and DNA transcription metabolism). Previous genetic studies of svPPA are limited by small sample sizes and a paucity of common risk variants. Despite this, svPPA's relatively homogenous clinicopathologic phenotype makes it an ideal investigative model to examine genetic processes that may drive neurodegenerative disease. In this study, we used GWAS metadata, tissue samples from pathologically confirmed frontotemporal lobar degeneration, and in silico techniques to identify and characterize protein interaction networks associated with svPPA risk. We identified 64 svPPA risk genes that interact at the protein level. The protein pathways represented in this svPPA gene network are critical regulators of RNA metabolism and cell death, such as SMAD proteins and NOTCH1. Many of the genes in this network are involved in TDP43 metabolism. Contrary to the conventional notion that svPPA is a clinical syndrome with few genetic risk factors, our analyses show that svPPA risk is complex and polygenic in nature. Risk for svPPA is likely driven by multiple common variants in genes interacting with TDP43, along with cell death,x` working in combination to promote neurodegeneration.", "authors": "Luke W.

Demographic and epidemiological data were collected for further analysis. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to evaluate risk factors of TE in pleural TB, ageadjusted odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) were calculated to show the risk. The mean age was 35.7  18.1 years old, males comprised 79.1% of the participants (375 cases). Fortyseven patients (9.9%) were multidrugresistant TB (MDRTB), 29 (6.1%) had retreatment TB, 26 (5.5%) had diabetes mellitus. The percentage of empyema patients was 8.9% (42 cases).

The spectrometer employs a virtually imaged phased array, diffraction grating and nearinfrared camera to fully resolve the comb modes.

Previously, we demonstrated that CrkII plays an important role in osteoclast differentiation and function through Rac1 activation both in vitro and in vivo. In this study, we investigated whether CrkII also regulates the differentiation and function of another type of bone cells, osteoblasts. Overexpression of CrkII in primary osteoblasts inhibited bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) 2induced osteoblast differentiation and function, whereas knockdown of CrkII expression exerted the opposite effect. Importantly, CrkII strongly enhanced cJunNterminal kinase (JNK) phosphorylation, and the CrkII overexpressionmediated attenuation of osteoblast differentiation and function was recovered by JNK inhibitor treatment. Furthermore, transgenic mice overexpressing CrkII under control of the alpha1 type I collagen promoter exhibited a reduced bone mass phenotype. Together, these results indicate that CrkII negatively regulates osteoblast differentiation and function through JNK phosphorylation. Given that CrkII acts as a negative and positive regulator of osteoblast and osteoclast differentiation, respectively, the regulation of CrkII expression in bone cells may help to develop new strategies to enhance bone formation and inhibit bone resorption. A protein that facilitates interactions between proteins and regulates cell signalling pathways blocks the differentiation and function of boneforming osteoblast cells. Nacksung Kim and colleagues at Chonnam National University Medical School in Gwangju, South Korea, previously showed that CrkII, a socalled adaptor protein that links proteinbinding partners and enables the formation of larger signaling complexes, enhanced the differentiation of boneresorbing osteoclasts and stimulated their resorptive function. Now, they demonstrate in cells and transgenic mice that CrkII also prevents the formation of osteoblasts from precursor cells and reduces osteoblast activity. This effect involved the activation of two specific signalling proteins and was reversed by their inhibitors. Therefore, CrkII could be a useful target for both stimulating bone formation and reducing resorption.", "authors": "Jung Ha Kim; Kabsun Kim; Inyoung Kim; Semun Seong; KwangIl Nam; Kyung Keun Kim; Nacksung Kim", "keywords": "Cell signalling; Transcription", "organization_affiliated": "Department of Pharmacology, Chonnam National University Medical School, Gwangju, Republic of Korea; Department of Pharmacology, Chonnam National University Medical School, Gwangju, Republic of Korea; Department of Pharmacology, Chonnam National University Medical School, Gwangju, Republic of Korea; Department of Pharmacology, Chonnam National University Medical School, Gwangju, Republic of Korea; Department of Biomedical Sciences, Chonnam National University Medical School, Gwangju, Republic of Korea; Department of Anatomy, Chonnam National University Medical School, Gwangju, Republic of Korea; Department of Pharmacology, Chonnam National University Medical School, Gwangju, Republic of Korea; Department of Pharmacology, Chonnam National University Medical School, Gwangju, Republic of Korea; Department of Biomedical Sciences, Chonnam National University Medical School, Gwangju, Republic of Korea"}

In the present study, we developed a TP5loaded, phospholipidbased phase separation gel (PPSG) to achieve sustained drug release profile and longlasting therapeutic effects. We firstly demonstrated the physiochemical characteristics of PPSG before and after phase transition by examining the viscosity and morphology change caused by the phase transition. Moreover, the PPSG exerted a low cytotoxicity in L929 cells and HUVECs, suggesting the biocompatibility of PPSG. A monthlong drug release profile of TP5 PPSG was observed both in vitro and in vivo, revealing its sustained and controlled drug release property. Most importantly, in cyclophosphamideinduced immunosuppressive rats, a single dose of TP5 PPSG (15 mgkg, sc) injected could normalize their TSOD levels and CD4CD8 ratio; such an immunoregulatory effect was comparable to that produced by repeated injection of TP5 solution (0.6 mgkg per day, sc) for 14 consecutive days.

We show that membranetype matrix metalloproteinase 14 (MMP14) is central to ECM degradation at the focal adhesions in human ARPE19 cells. The matrix degradative activity, but not the assembly, of the focal adhesion is regulated by chloride intracellular channel 4 (CLIC4). CLIC4 is colocalized with MMP14 in the late endosome. CLIC4 regulates the proper sorting of MMP14 into the lumen of the late endosome and its proteolytic activation in lipid rafts. CLIC4 has the newlyidentified \"late domain\" motif that binds to MMP14 and to Tsg101, a component of the endosomal sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT) complex. Unlike the late domain mutant CLIC4, wildtype CLIC4 can rescue the late endosomal sorting defect of MMP14. Finally, CLIC4 knockdown inhibits the apical secretion of MMP2 in polarized human RPE monolayers.

We investigated the genome wide effects of the nutritional status on the PXR mediated gene regulation in the liver. Mice were treated with a PXR ligand pregnenolone 16carbonitrile (PCN) for 4 days and subsequently either fasted for 5 hours or after 4hour fast treated with intragastric glucose 1 hour before sample collection. Gene expression microarray study indicated that PCN both induced and repressed much higher number of genes in the glucose fed mice and the induction of multiple wellestablished PXR target genes was potentiated by glucose. A subset of genes, including bile acid synthesis gene Cyp8b1, responded in an opposite direction during fasting and after glucose feeding. PXR knockout abolished these effects.

However, the mechanisms that drive cell survival during a normally lytic infection remained unclear. Using a lossoffunction screening approach, we discovered that the DNA mismatch repair (MMR) pathway is essential for club cell survival of IAV infection. Repair of virally induced oxidative damage by the DNA MMR pathway not only allowed cell survival of infection, but also facilitated host gene transcription, including the expression of antiviral and stress response genes. Enhanced viral suppression of the DNA MMR pathway prevented club cell survival and increased the severity of viral disease in vivo. Altogether, these results identify previously unappreciated roles for DNA MMR as a central modulator of cellular fate and a contributor to the innate antiviral response, which together control influenza viral disease severity. Survival of epithelial club cells to influenza A virus infection depends on the ability of the DNA mismatch repair pathway to repair virusinduced oxidative damage and to promote the transcriptional induction of host antiviral genes.", "authors": "Benjamin S.

Most APDs are sporadic, but rare familial forms have also been reported. Epidemiological and postmortem studies associated APDs with oxidative stress and cellular protein aggregates. Identifying molecular mechanisms that translate stress into toxic protein aggregation and neurodegeneration in APDs is an active area of research. Recently, ribonucleic acid (RNA) stress granule (SG) pathways were discussed to be pathogenically relevant in several neurodegenerative disorders including APDs. Using whole genome sequencing, mRNA expression analysis, transfection assays and cell imaging, we investigated the genetic and molecular basis of a familial neurodegenerative atypical parkinsonian disorder. We investigated a family with six living members in two generations exhibiting clinical symptoms consistent with atypical parkinsonism. Two affected family members suffered from parkinsonism that was associated with ataxia. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of these patients showed brainstem and cerebellar atrophy. Whole genome sequencing identified a heterozygous stopgain variant (c.C811T; p.R271X) in the Poly(A) binding protein, cytoplasmic 4like (PABPC4L) gene, which cosegregated with the disease in the family. In situ hybridization showed that the murine pabpc4l is expressed in several brain regions and in particular in the cerebellum and brainstem. To determine the functional impact of the stopgain variant in the PABPC4L gene, we investigated the subcellular localization of PABPC4L in heterologous cells. Wildtype PABPC4L protein localized predominantly to the cell nucleus, in contrast to the truncated protein encoded by the stopgain variant p.R271X, which was found homogeneously throughout the cell. Interestingly, the wildtype, but not the truncated protein localized to RasGAP SH3 domain Binding Protein (G3BP)labeled cytoplasmic granules in response to oxidative stress induction. This suggests that the PABPC4L variant alters intracellular distribution and possibly the stress granule associated function of the protein, which may underlie APD in this family. In conclusion, we present genetic and molecular evidence supporting the role of a stopgain PABPC4L variant in a rare familial APD.

PPCDC is required for CoA biosynthesis and in most eukaryotes is a homotrimeric complex with three identical catalytic sites at the trimer interfaces. However, in S. cerevisiae the heterotrimeric arrangement results in a single functional catalytic center. Importantly, the specific structural determinants that direct Hal3's oligomeric state and those required for Ppz1 inhibition remain largely unknown. We mutagenized residues in the predicted hydrophobic core of ScHal3 (L403L405) and the plant Arabidopsis thaliana Hal3 (AtHal3, G115L117) oligomers and characterized their properties as PPCDC components and, for ScHal3, also as Ppz1 inhibitor. We found that in AtHal3 these changes do not affect trimerization or PPCDC function. Similarly, mutation of ScHal3 L403 has no effect. In contrast, ScHal3 L405E fails to form homotrimers, but retains the capacity to bind Cab3explaining its ability to rescue a hal3 vhs3 synthetically lethal mutation. Remarkably, the L405E mutation decreases Hal3's ability to interact with and to inhibit Ppz1, confirming the importance of the oligomermonomer equilibrium in Hal3's Ppz1 regulating function.", "authors": "Carlos Santolaria; Diego Velazquez; Erick Strauss; Joaquin Arino", "keywords": "Fungi; Proteins", "organization_affiliated": "Departament de Bioquimica i Biologia Molecular and Institut de Biotecnologia i Biomedicina, Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona, Bellaterra, Spain; Departament de Bioquimica i Biologia Molecular and Institut de Biotecnologia i Biomedicina, Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona, Bellaterra, Spain; Department of Biochemistry, Stellenbosch University, Matieland, South Africa; Departament de Bioquimica i Biologia Molecular and Institut de Biotecnologia i Biomedicina, Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona, Bellaterra, Spain"}

During a particular phase of the retina development (stage II) these waves are triggered by a transient network of neurons, called Starburst Amacrine Cells (SACs), showing a bursting activity which disappears upon further maturation. The underlying mechanisms of the spontaneous bursting and the transient excitability of immature SACs are not completely clear yet. While several models have attempted to reproduce retinal waves, none of them is able to mimic the rhythmic autonomous bursting of individual SACs and reveal how these cells change their intrinsic properties during development. Here, we introduce a mathematical model, grounded on biophysics, which enables us to reproduce the bursting activity of SACs and to propose a plausible, generic and robust, mechanism that generates it. The core parameters controlling repetitive firing are fast depolarizing Vgated calcium channels and hyperpolarizing Vgated potassium channels. The quiescent phase of bursting is controlled by a slow after hyperpolarization (sAHP), mediated by calciumdependent potassium channels. Based on a bifurcation analysis we show how biophysical parameters, regulating calcium and potassium activity, control the spontaneously occurring fast oscillatory activity followed by long refractory periods in individual SACs. We make a testable experimental prediction on the role of voltagedependent potassium channels on the excitability properties of SACs and on the evolution of this excitability along development. We also propose an explanation on how SACs can exhibit a large variability in their bursting periods, as observed experimentally within a SACs network as well as across different species, yet based on a simple, unique, mechanism. As we discuss, these observations at the cellular level have a deep impact on the retinal waves description.", "authors": "Dora MatzakosKarvouniari; Lionel Gil; Elaine Orendorff; Olivier Marre; Serge Picaud; Bruno Cessac", "keywords": "Applied mathematics; Biophysical models; Dynamical systems", "organization_affiliated": "Biovision team, Universite Cote d'Azur, Inria, France; INPHYNI, Universite Cote d'Azur, CNRS, Sophia Antipolis, France; Institut de la Vision, Paris, France; Institut de la Vision, Paris, France; Institut de la Vision, Paris, France; Biovision team, Universite Cote d'Azur, Inria, France"}

HA biosynthesis is catalysed by hyaluronan synthase (HAS). The unavailability of 3D structure of HAS and gaps in molecular understanding of HA biosynthesis process pose challenges in rational engineering of HAS to control HA molecular weight and titer.

Our study identifies 9 SSE in HAS and elucidates their role in substrate and polymer binding and polymer biosynthesis. Molecular modelling and docking assessment indicate a single binding site for two UDPsubstrates implying conformationallydriven alternating substrate specificities for this class of enzymes. This is the first report hypothesizing the involvement of sites from SSE5 in polymer binding. Mutation at these sites influence HA production, indicating a tight coupling of polymer binding and synthase functions.

In the malaria parasite, chorismate is postulated to be a direct precursor in the synthesis of paminobenzoic acid (folate biosynthesis), phydroxybenzoic acid (ubiquinone biosynthesis), menaquinone, and aromatic amino acids. While the potential value of the shikimate pathway as a drug target is debatable, the metabolic dependency of chorismate in P. falciparum remains unclear. Current evidence suggests that the main role of chorismate is folate biosynthesis despite ubiquinone biosynthesis being active and essential in the malaria parasite. Our goal in the present work was to expand our knowledge of the ubiquinone head group biosynthesis and its potential metabolic dependency on chorismate in P. falciparum. We systematically assessed the development of both asexual and sexual stages of P. falciparum in a defined medium in the absence of an exogenous supply of chorismate endproducts and present biochemical evidence suggesting that the benzoquinone ring of ubiquinones in this parasite may be synthesized through a yet unidentified route.", "authors": "Ana Lisa Valenciano; Maria L.

The feasibility to find stable BNF isomers with atomic arrangement other than the wellknown octahedral Thsymmetry was explored. In this study, the number of homonuclear bonds in the modeled nanostructures was used as categorical parameter to describe and quantify the degree of structural order. The BNF without homonuclear bonds was identified as the most energetically favorable isomer. However, a variety of BNF arrays departing from Thsymmetry was determined as stable structures also. The calculated vibrational spectra suggest that isomers with chemical disorder can be identified by infrared spectroscopy. In general, formation of homonuclear bonds is possible meanwhile the entropy of the system increases, but at expense of cohesive energy. It is proposed that formation of phasesegregated regions stablishes an apparent limit to the number of homonuclear bonds in stable B12N12 fullerenes. It was found that formation of homonuclear bonds decreases substantially the chemical hardness of BNF isomers and generates zones with large charge density, which might act as reactive sites. Moreover, chemical disorder endows BNF isomers with a permanent electric dipole moment as large as 3.28 D. The obtained results suggest that by manipulating their chemical order, the interaction of BNF's with other molecular entities can be controlled, making them potential candidates for drug delivery, catalysis and sensing.", "authors": "Alejandro EscobedoMorales; Lorenzo TepechCarrillo; Alejandro BautistaHernandez; Jose Humberto CamachoGarcia; Diego CortesArriagada; Ernesto ChigoAnota", "keywords": "Carbon nanotubes and fullerenes; Computational methods", "organization_affiliated": "Facultad de Ingenieria Quimica, Benemerita Universidad Autonoma de Puebla, Av.

We find that high gene expression levels of mouse Nap1l3 are restricted to haematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) in mice. Importantly, with shRNA or CRISPRCas9 mediated loss of function of mouse Nap1l3 and with overexpression of the gene, the number of colonyforming cells and myeloid progenitor cells in vitro are reduced. This manifests as a striking decrease in the number of HSCs, which reduces their reconstituting activities in vivo. Downregulation of human NAP1L3 in umbilical cord blood (UCB) HSCs impairs the maintenance and proliferation of HSCs both in vitro and in vivo. NAP1L3 downregulation in UCB HSCs causes an arrest in the G0 phase of cell cycle progression and induces gene expression signatures that significantly correlate with downregulation of gene sets involved in cell cycle regulation, including E2F and MYC target genes. Moreover, we demonstrate that HOXA3 and HOXA5 genes are markedly upregulated when NAP1L3 is suppressed in UCB HSCs.

During the last decades, similarities in the viral cycle and the structure of some of their proteins with those of the order Caudovirales, the tailed bacterial viruses, have brought speculation regarding the existence of an evolutionary relationship between these clades. To evaluate such hypothesis, we used over 600 Herpesvirales and 2000 Caudovirales complete genomes to search for the presence or absence of clusters of orthologous protein domains and constructed a dendrogram based on their compositional similarities. The results obtained strongly suggest an evolutionary relationship between the two orders. Furthermore, they allowed to propose a core genome for the Herpesvirales, composed of 4 proteins, including the ATPase subunit of the DNApackaging terminase, the only protein with previously verified conservation. Accordingly, a phylogenetic tree constructed with sequences derived from the clusters associated to these proteins grouped the Herpesvirales strains accordingly to the established families and subfamilies.

At very low concentrations found in CF patients (0.0050.1 ngml), both cytokines inhibited ROS production, while higher concentrations (15 ngml) exerted a stimulatory effect. While either CSF induced elastase and MMP9 secretion, lactoferrin levels were increased only by GCSF. Chemotaxis was inhibited by GMCSF, but was increased by GCSF.

Analysis of the lipidomic data showed that overweight and obese mothers exhibited a significant reduction in the total abundance of ceramides (Cer) in plasma, mainly of Cer (d18:120:0), Cer (d18:122:0), Cer (d18:123:0), and Cer (d18:124:0), compared with mothers of normal body weight. This reduction was confirmed by the direct quantification of these and other ceramide species. Similar quantitative differences in the plasma concentration of Cer (d18:122:0), Cer (d18:123:0), and Cer (d18:124:0), were also found between 4yearold children of overweight and obese mothers compared with children of mothers of normal body weight. Noteworthy, children exhibited equal daily amounts of energy and food intake independently of the BMI of their mothers. Maternal obesity results in longlasting changes in plasma ceramides in the offspring suggesting that these lipids might be used as early predictors of metabolic disease risk due to maternal obesity.", "authors": "Luis Felipe LeonAguilar; Mikael Croyal; Veronique FerchaudRoucher; Fengyang Huang; Laurence A.

However, it is not clear whether the development of femoral cortical bone can be quantitatively evaluated according to a diet with inadequate magnesium supplementation. Therefore, we used a micro computed tomography (CT) imaging approach with a laboratory mouse model to explore the potential application of texture analysis for the quantitative assessment of femoral cortical bones. C57BL6J male mice were divided into two groups, where one group was fed a normal diet and the other group was fed a lowmagnesium diet. We used a micro CT scanner for image acquisition, and the subsequent development of cortical bone was examined by texture analysis based on the statistical distribution of grayscale intensities in which seven essential parameters were extracted from the micro CT images. Our calculations showed that the mean intensity increased by 7.20% (p  0.000134), sigma decreased by 29.18% (p  1.98E12), skewness decreased by 19.52% (p  0.0000205), kurtosis increased by 9.62% (p  0.0877), energy increased by 24.19% (p  3.32E09), entropy decreased by 6.14% (p  3.00E10), and the Nakagami parameter increased by 104.32% (p  4.13E12) in the lowmagnesium group when compared to the normal group.

These protocols included chronic variable stress, chronic shock, social defeat and social isolation. The response of the transcriptome to stress suggested that there are genes that respond in a universal or stress modalityindependent manner, as well as genes that respond in a stress modalityspecific manner. Using a small number of the genes selected from the modalityindependent set of stresssensitive genes, a sensitive and robust measure of chronic stress exposure was developed. This stresssensitive gene expression (SSGE) index could detect chronic traumatic stress exposure in a wide range of different stress models in a manner that was relatively independent of the modality of stress exposure and that paralleled the intensity of stress exposure in a dosedependent manner. This measure could reliably distinguish control and stressed individuals in the case of animals exposed to the most intense stress protocols. The response of a subset of the modalityspecific genes could also distinguish some types of stress exposure, based solely on changes in the pattern of gene expression.

Advanced stage NB is metastatic, which is a principal cause of cancerrelated deaths. We presently document a primary role of MDA9 in NB progression and define the molecular mechanisms by which MDA9 promotes transformed phenotypes. NB cell lines and clinical samples display elevated MDA9 expression and bioinformatic analysis supports an association between elevated MDA9 and bone metastasis and poor prognosis. Genetic (shmda9, mda9 siRNA) or pharmacological (small molecule inhibitor of proteinprotein interactions; PDZ1i) blockade of MDA9 decreases NB migration, invasion, and metastasis. Blocking mda9 expression or disrupting MDA9 partner protein interactions downregulates integrin 6 and 4, diminishing Src activity and suppressing RhoRacCdc42 activity. These signaling changes inhibit cofilin and matrix metalloproteinases reducing in vitro and in vivo NB cell migration. Overexpression of integrin 6 and 4 rescues the invasion phenotype and increases Src activity, supporting integrins as essential regulators of MDA9mediated NB migration and invasion. We identify MDA9 as a key contributor to NB pathogenesis and show that genetic or pharmacological inhibition suppresses NB pathogenesis by an integrinmediated Srcdisruption pathway.", "authors": "Praveen Bhoopathi; Anjan K.

This study aims to explore the perspectives of cancer patients' relatives about cancer heritability, addressing cancer family history, and performing genetic testing in palliative care settings. Thirteen firstdegree relatives of cancer patients who died in palliative care participated in the study. Two focus groups were conducted and transcribed verbatim. Two independent coders conducted a thematic content analysis. The themes included: (1) Knowledge of cancer heritability; (2) Experiences and expectations regarding cancer family history discussions, and (3) Views on genetic testing in palliative care patients and DNA biobanking. Participants seemed aware that cancer family history is a potential risk factor for developing the disease. They considered the palliative care period an inappropriate moment to discuss cancer heritability. They also did not consider palliative care providers as appropriate resources to consult for such matters as they are not specialized in this field. Participants welcomed DNA biobanking and genetic testing conducted at the palliative care patients' request. Cancer occurrence within families raises concerns among relatives about cancer heritability, but the palliative care period is not considered the most appropriate moment to address this issue.

It is shown that the creation and annihilation of selfinterstitials and vacancies occur at atomic steps and can be described by introducing a diffusive layer of the bulk point defects adsorbed just below the surface. The atomic step rate of advance is studied taking into account finite permeability of the surface for bulk and surface point defects.

During sepsis, endothelial permeability is severely augmented, contributing to renal dysfunction and patient mortality. Ca2 influx and the subsequent increase in intracellular Ca2]i in endothelial cells (ECs) are key steps in the establishment of endothelial hyperpermeability. Transient receptor potential melastatin 7 (TRPM7) ion channels are permeable to Ca2 and are expressed in a broad range of cell types and tissues, including ECs and kidneys. However, the role of TRPM7 on endothelial hyperpermeability during sepsis has remained elusive. Therefore, we investigated the participation of TRPM7 in renal vascular hyperpermeability, renal dysfunction, and enhanced mortality induced by endotoxemia. Our results showed that endotoxin increases endothelial hyperpermeability and Ca2 overload through the TLR4NOX2ROSNFB pathway. Moreover, endotoxin exposure was shown to downregulate the expression of VEcadherin, compromising monolayer integrity and enhancing vascular hyperpermeability. Notably, endotoxininduced endothelial hyperpermeability was substantially inhibited by pharmacological inhibition and specific suppression of TRPM7 expression. The endotoxin was shown to upregulate the expression of TRPM7 via the TLR4NOX2ROSNFB pathway and induce a TRPM7dependent EC Ca2 overload. Remarkably, in vivo experiments performed in endotoxemic animals showed that pharmacological inhibition and specific suppression of TRPM7 expression inhibits renal vascular hyperpermeability, prevents kidney dysfunction, and improves survival in endotoxemic animals. Therefore, our results showed that TRPM7 mediates endotoxemiainduced endothelial hyperpermeability, renal dysfunction, and enhanced mortality, revealing a novel molecular target for treating renal vascular hyperpermeability and kidney dysfunction during endotoxemia, sepsis, and other inflammatory diseases. Acute kidney injury and endothelial hyperpermeability are main features observed during severe sepsis with low survival rate. Transient receptor potential melastatin 7 (TRPM7) calcium channel inhibition protects against endotoxemiainduced kidney injury potentially by means of endothelial hyperpermeability decreasing.

Incubations of Chukchi Sea bottom water microbiomes showed similar, but delayed functional responses to identical treatments. Although 24 functional terms were shared between experimental treatments, the timing, and degree of the remaining responses were highly variable, showing that organic matter perturbation directs community functionality prior to alterations to the taxonomic distribution at the microbiome class level. The dynamic responses of these two oceanic microbial communities have important implications for timing and magnitude of responses to organic perturbations within the Arctic Ocean and how communitylevel functions may forecast biogeochemical gradients in oceans.", "authors": "Molly P.

The outbreak resulted in two fatalities. A distinct social group associated with one of the cases was selected for vaccination with 4CMenB and pharyngeal swabbing. In vitro culturing, multiple realtime PCR assays (sodC, ctrA and siaDB) and a PorA PCRsequencing assay were used to detect meningococcal colonisation and a carriage rate of 32.6% was observed. Furthermore, a high proportion of the pharyngeal swabs (78.3%) yielded a Factor HBinding Protein (fHbp) nucleotide allele suggesting that the antigenic gene is prevalent among nonmeningococcal flora, most likely Neisseria commensals.

Automatic imitation relies on motor stimulusresponse compatibility (SRC), i.e., response conflict caused by motoric (in)congruency between taskirrelevant hand stimuli and the required response. Our novel task aimed to separate two distinct neurocognitive processing stages of automatic imitation and its modulation by ethnicity: the stage of stimulus processing (i.e. perception), comprising presentation of stimulus ethnicity and SRC, and the stage of response execution (i.e. action). Effects of ethnicity were observed in ERPs of different stages of stimulus processing  during presentation of ethnicity (LPP) and SRC (N190, P3). ERPs at response execution, PreMotion Positivity (PMP) and Reafferent Potential (RAP), were only sensitive to congruency. The N190 results may index visual selfother distinction, while the neural timecourse of P3 and PMP variation could reflect a dynamical decision process linking perception to action, with motor initiation reflected in the PMP component. The PMP might further index motorrelated selfother distinction regardless of ethnicity.

However, only a small number of circRNAs have been experimentally validated and functionally annotated. In this study, using a highthroughput microarray assay, we identified a novel circRNA, circKDM4C, which was downregulated in breast cancer tissues with metastasis. Furthermore, we analyzed a cohort of breast cancer patients and found that circKDM4C expression was decreased in breast cancer tissues, and lower circKDM4C expression was associated with poor prognosis and metastasis in breast cancer. Functionally, we demonstrated that circKDM4C significantly repressed breast cancer proliferation, metastasis, and doxorubicin resistance in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, using a dualluciferase activity assay and AGO2 RNA immunoprecipitation, circKDM4C was identified as a miR548p sponge. We also found that PBLD was a direct target of miR548p, which functioned as a tumor suppressor in breast cancer. Moreover, miR548p overexpression was able to reverse the circKDM4Cinduced attenuation of malignant phenotypes and elevated expression of PBLD in breast cancer cells. Taken together, our data indicate that circKDM4C might have considerable potential as a prognostic biomarker in breast cancer, and support the notion that therapeutic targeting of circKDM4CmiR548pPBLD axis may be a promising treatment approach for breast cancer patients.", "authors": "Yiran Liang; Xiaojin Song; Yaming Li; Peng Su; Dianwen Han; Tingting Ma; Renbo Guo; Bing Chen; Wenjing Zhao; Yuting Sang; Ning Zhang; Xiaoyan Li; Hanwen Zhang; Ying Liu; Yi Duan; Lijuan Wang; Qifeng Yang", "keywords": "Cancer; Cell biology; Noncoding RNAs", "organization_affiliated": "Department of Breast Surgery, Qilu Hospital of Shandong University, Jinan, PR China; Department of Breast Surgery, Qilu Hospital of Shandong University, Jinan, PR China; Department of Breast Surgery, Qilu Hospital of Shandong University, Jinan, PR China; Department of Pathology, Qilu Hospital of Shandong University, Jinan, PR China; Department of Breast Surgery, Qilu Hospital of Shandong University, Jinan, PR China; Department of Breast Surgery, Qilu Hospital of Shandong University, Jinan, PR China; Department of Urology, Shandong cancer hospital affiliated to Shandong University, Jinan, PR China; Pathology Tissue Bank, Qilu Hospital of Shandong University, Jinan, PR China; Pathology Tissue Bank, Qilu Hospital of Shandong University, Jinan, PR China; Department of Breast Surgery, Qilu Hospital of Shandong University, Jinan, PR China; Department of Breast Surgery, Qilu Hospital of Shandong University, Jinan, PR China; Department of Breast Surgery, Qilu Hospital of Shandong University, Jinan, PR China; Department of Breast Surgery, Qilu Hospital of Shandong University, Jinan, PR China; Department of Breast Surgery, Qilu Hospital of Shandong University, Jinan, PR China; Department of Breast Surgery, Qilu Hospital of Shandong University, Jinan, PR China; Pathology Tissue Bank, Qilu Hospital of Shandong University, Jinan, PR China; Department of Breast Surgery, Qilu Hospital of Shandong University, Jinan, PR China; Pathology Tissue Bank, Qilu Hospital of Shandong University, Jinan, PR China"}

Several methods for delivery of suicide genes have been explored. Two important considerations for delivery are the quantity of delivered cargo and the ability to target the cargo to specific cells. Delivery using a lentiviral vector is particularly attractive due to the ability to encode the gene within the viral genome, as well as the ability to limit offtarget effects by using cell typespecific glycoproteins. Here, we present the design and validation of a diphtheria toxin A (DTA)encoding lentiviral vector expressing DTA under the control of a constituitive promoter to allow for expression of DTA in a variety of cell types, with specificity provided via selection of glycoproteins for pseudotyping of the lentiviral particles. DTA exerts its toxic activity through inhibition of eukaryotic translation elongation factor 2 (eEF2) via adenosine diphosphate (ADP)ribosylation of a modified histidine residue, diphthamide, at His715, which blocks protein translation and leads to cell death. Thus, we also detail development of DTAresistant cell lines, engineered through CRISPRCas9mediated knockout of the diphthamide 1 (DPH1) gene, which enable both robust virus production by transfection and evaluation of DTAexpressing virus infectivity.", "authors": "Margaret J.

In a cohort of SLE patients, we show a significant association between HCMV infection and SLE through a human antibody response that targets UL44.

To characterise this response, we present a thorough molecular analysis of the first human monoclonal antibody specific for UL44 derived from a HCMV seropositive donor. This human antibody immunoprecipitates UL44 from HCMVinfected cells together with known nuclearresident SLE autoantigens  namely, nucleolin, dsDNA and ku70. We also show that UL44 is redistributed to the cell surface during virusinduced apoptosis as part of a complex with these autoantigens.

Previously, we reported a receptorindependent HIV1 entry into epithelial cells mediated by a Gramnegative invasive bacterium, Porphyromonas gingivalis. Here, we present evidence showing that P. gingivalis outer membrane vesicles (OMVs) promote mucosal transmission of HIV1. We demonstrated, using the Dynabeads technology, a specific interaction between HIV1 and P. gingivalis OMVs which led to an OMVdependent viral entry into oral epithelial cells. HIV1 was detected in human oral keratinocytes (HOKs) after a 20 minute exposure to the HIVvesicle complexes. After entry, most of the complexes appeared to dissociate, HIV1 was reversetranscribed, and viral DNA was integrated into the genome of HOKs. Meanwhile, some of the complexes exited the original host and reentered neighboring HOKs and permissive cells of HIV1. Moreover, P. gingivalis vesicles enhanced HIV1 infection of MT4 cells at low infecting doses that are not able to establish an efficient infection alone.

The molecular mechanisms involving G1S transcriptional regulation are well established and have been shown to be evolutionary conserved from yeast to humans. Previous work has suggested that changes to the chromatin state, specifically through histone acetylation, has an important role in the regulation of G1S transcription in both yeast and human cells. Here we investigate the role of histone acetylation in G1S transcriptional regulation in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Our work shows that histone acetylation at specific sites at G1S target gene promoters peaks at the G1toS transition, coinciding with their peak transcription levels. Acetylation at G1S target promoters is significantly reduced upon deletion of the previously implicated histone acetyltransferase Gcn5, but G1S cell cycle regulated transcription is largely unaffected. The histone deacetylase Rpd3, suggested to have a role in Whi5dependent repression, is required for full repression of G1S target genes in the G1 and S phases. However, in the context of transcriptionally active levels during the G1toS transition, this seems to play a minor role in the regulation of cell cycle transcription. Our data suggests that histone acetylation might modulate the amplitude of G1S cell cycle regulated transcription in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, but has a limited role in its overall regulation.", "authors": "A.

One possible causal mechanism is differential intake of tobacco toxicants, but results across studies are inconsistent. Thus, we examined racial differences in biomarkers of toxic volatile organic compounds (VOCs) present in tobacco smoke. We analyzed baseline data collected from 182 Black and 184 White adult smokers who participated in a randomized clinical trial in 20132014 at 10 sites across the United States. We examined differences in urinary levels of ten VOC metabolites, total nicotine equivalents (TNE), and 4(methylnitrosamino)1(3pyridyl)1butanol (NNAL), controlling for covariates such as cigarettes per day (CPD), as well as differences in VOCs per TNE to assess the extent to which tobacco exposure, and not metabolic factors, accounted for racial differences. Concentration of metabolites of acrolein, acrylonitrile, ethylene oxide, and methylating agents were significantly higher in Blacks compared to Whites when controlled for covariates. Other than the metabolite of methylating agents, VOCs per TNE did not differ between Blacks and Whites. Concentrations of TNECPD and VOCsCPD were significantly higher in Blacks. Menthol did not contribute to racial differences in VOC levels. For a given level of CPD, Black smokers likely take in higher levels of acrolein, acrylonitrile, and ethylene oxide than White smokers. Our findings are consistent with Blacks taking in more nicotine and toxicants per cigarette smoked, which may explain their elevated disease risk relative to other racial groups.", "authors": "Gideon St.Helen; Neal L.

DNA samples from 1127 individuals, including normal hearing controls (n  616), sporadic SNHL patients (n  433), and deaf individuals (n  78) from 30 hearing loss pedigrees were collected. The NGS tests included analysis of sequence alterations in 129 genes. The variants were interpreted according to the ACMGAMP guidelines for genetic hearing loss combined with NGS data from 616 ethnically matched normal hearing adult controls. We identified a positive molecular diagnosis in 226 patients with sporadic SNHL (52.19%) and in patients from 17 deafness pedigrees (56.67%). Ethnically matched MAF filtering reduced the variants of unknown significance by 8.7%, from 6216 to 5675. Some complexities that may restrict causative variant identification are discussed.

Here we address this issue with an abundancemanipulation experiment that was conducted in a semiarid grassland. We manually increased the abundance of six randomly chosen resident bacterial species in separate, closed, communities and allowed the communities to recover in situ for 1 year. The single episode of increase in the abundance of different species drove speciesspecific community divergence accompanied by a decline in local diversity. Four of the six added species caused a decrease in the abundance of their closely related species, suggesting an important role of interspecific competition in driving the observed community divergence. Our results also suggested a lack of effective population regulations to force the relative abundance of manipulated species to revert to original level, which would allow persistence of the divergence among soil bacterial communities.

We found the TC variant of rs1317082, locating at the exon 1 of lncRNA RP11362K14.5 (CCSlnc362), was predicted to be a protective locus for cancer. However, the specific role of CCSlnc362 and the interaction between CCSlnc362 and rs1317082 variation in colorectal cancer and its mechanisms remain unclear. Here we explored the expression and function of CCSlnc362 in CRC cells and tissues. We found lncRNA CCSlnc362 expression was significantly increased in CRC samples. Followup functional experiments elucidated that downregulation of CCSlnc362 inhibited cell proliferation, arrested cell cycle, and promoted apoptosis in CRC cells. The TC variant of rs1317082 at CCSlnc362 exon 1 created a binding site for miR4658 to reduce the expression of CCSlnc362 and thus decreased the susceptibility to CRC.

Ipatasertib, a novel highly selective ATPcompetitive panAkt inhibitor, shows a strong antitumor effect in a variety of carcinoma, including colon cancer. However, there is a lack of knowledge about the precise underlying mechanism of clinical therapy for colon cancer. We conducted this study to determine that ipatasertib prevented colon cancer growth through PUMAdependent apoptosis. Ipatasertib led to p53independent PUMA activation by inhibiting Akt, thereby activating both FoxO3a and NFB synchronously that will directly bind to PUMA promoter, upregulating PUMA transcription and Baxmediated intrinsic mitochondrial apoptosis. Remarkably, AktFoxO3aPUMA is the major pathway while AktNFBPUMA is the secondary pathway of PUMA activation induced by ipatasertib in colon cancer. Knocking out PUMA eliminated ipatasertibinduced apoptosis both in vitro and in vivo (xenografts). Furthermore, PUMA is also indispensable in combinational therapies of ipatasertib with some conventional or novel drugs.

However, the role of absorption in real metals has not been thoroughly considered. We provide a theoretical analysis showing that absorption leads to diminishing values of Purcell factor. We also suggest that using emitting organic compounds such as CBP (4,4Bis(Ncarbazolyl)1,1biphenyl) can lead to a moderate increase of about an order of magnitude in the Purcell factor. Defining the experimentally measured Purcell factor as a ratio between the excited state lifetimes in bare CBP and in periodic structure, this increase in the fabricated periodic structure is demonstrated through a 48 times decrease in excited state radiative lifetime compared to a bare organic material in a wide emission spectrum.", "authors": "Konstantin M.

However, the molecular identity of the transport system remains elusive. Previous studies have demonstrated that isolated SVs exhibit two distinct Ca2 transport systems depending on extravesicular (cytosolic) pH; one is mediated by a high affinity Ca2 transporter which is active at neutral pH and the other is mediated by a low affinity Ca2H antiporter which is maximally active at alkaline pH of 8.5. In addition, synaptic vesicle glycoprotein 2 s (SV2s), a major SV component, have been proposed to contribute to Ca2 clearance from the presynaptic cytoplasm. Here, we show that at physiological pH, the plasma membrane Ca2 ATPases (PMCAs) are responsible for both the Ca2H exchange activity and Ca2 uptake into SVs. The Ca2H exchange activity monitored by acidification assay exhibited high affinity for Ca2 (Km ~ 400 nM) and characteristic divalent cation selectivity for the PMCAs. Both activities were remarkably reduced by PMCA blockers, but not by a blocker of the ATPase that transfers Ca2 from the cytosol to the lumen of sarcoplasmic endoplasmic reticulum (SERCA) at physiological pH. Furthermore, we rule out the contribution of SV2s, putative Ca2 transporters on SVs, since both Ca2H exchange activity and Ca2 transport were unaffected in isolated vesicles derived from SV2deficient brains. Finally, using a PMCA1pHluorin construct that enabled us to monitor cellular distribution and recycling properties in living neurons, we demonstrated that PMCA1pHluorin localized to intracellular acidic compartments and recycled at presynaptic terminals in an activitydependent manner. Collectively, our results imply that vesicular PMCAs may play pivotal roles in both presynaptic Ca2 homeostasis and the modulation of H gradient in SVs.", "authors": "Yoshiyasu Ono; Yasunori Mori; Yoshihiro Egashira; Kenta Sumiyama; Shigeo Takamori", "keywords": "Neurotransmitters; Transporters in the nervous system", "organization_affiliated": "Laboratory of Neural Membrane Biology, Graduate School of Brain Science, Doshisha University, Kyotanabe, Japan; Laboratory of Neural Membrane Biology, Graduate School of Brain Science, Doshisha University, Kyotanabe, Japan; Laboratory of Neural Membrane Biology, Graduate School of Brain Science, Doshisha University, Kyotanabe, Japan; Department of Physiology, Faculty of Medicine, Osaka Medical College, Takatsuki, Japan; Laboratory for Mouse Genetic Engineering, RIKEN Center for Biosystems Dynamics Research, Suita, Japan; Laboratory of Neural Membrane Biology, Graduate School of Brain Science, Doshisha University, Kyotanabe, Japan"}

Here, for the first time, we show that activation of P2Rs in an important arousal region, the basal forebrain (BF), promotes wakefulness, whereas inhibition of P2Rs promotes sleep. Infusion of a nonhydrolysable P2R agonist, ATPS, into mouse BF increased wakefulness following sleep deprivation. ATPS depolarized BF cholinergic and corticallyprojecting GABAergic neurons in vitro, an effect blocked by antagonists of ionotropic P2Rs (P2XRs) or glutamate receptors. In vivo, ATPS infusion increased BF glutamate release. Thus, activation of BF P2XRs promotes glutamate release and excitation of wakeactive neurons. Conversely, pharmacological antagonism of BF P2XRs decreased spontaneous wakefulness during the dark (active) period. Together with previous findings, our results suggest sleepwake regulation by BF extracellular ATP involves a balance between excitatory, wakefulnesspromoting effects mediated by direct activation of P2XRs and inhibitory, sleeppromoting effects mediated by degradation to adenosine.", "authors": "Chun Yang; Andrei Larin; James T.

Another group of rats were placed in the same setup without air obstructions (Shamrats) and were considered controls. Our study demonstrates that chronic, noninvasive repetitive airway obstructions mimicking OSA promote remarkable structural changes of the descending thoracic aorta such as eccentric aortic hypertrophy due to an increased wall thickness and lumen diameter, an increase in the number of elastin fibers which, in contrast, get ruptured, but no changes in tunica media fibrosis. As putative molecular mechanisms of the OSAinduced vascular changes we identified an increase in reactive oxygen species and reninangiotensin system markers and an imbalance in oxide nitric synthesis.

A total of 10 samples made from commercially available pure yttrium iron garnet (YIG) and galliumsubstituted YIG have been measured, differing in diameter andor saturation magnetisation Ms. The dependence of the intrinsic H on the internal magnetic field is found to have nearperfect linear dependence, which cannot be said about the typically studied extrinsic H even at high frequencies. It is found that the difference between the two linewidths, which becomes significant at low frequencies, can be attributed to a geometric effect.

We report NAT1 polymorphism in 25 rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta) and describe the haplotypic and functional characteristics of 12 variants. Seven nonsynonymous single nucleotide variations (SNVs) were identified and experimentally demonstrated to compromise enzyme function, mainly through destabilization of NAT1 protein and consequent activity loss. One nonsynonymous SNV (c.560G  A, p.Arg187Gln) has also been characterized for human NAT1 with similar effects.

Known functional elements downstream of human NAT1 were also differentiated in rhesus macaque and other primates.

This study applied the Random Forest machine learning method, as well as motif screening models and a feature selection combination mechanism, to develop a SUMOylation prediction system, referred to as SUMOgo. With regard to prediction method, PTM sites were coded as new functional features in addition to structural features, such as sequencebased binary coding, encoded chemical features of proteins, and encoded secondary structure information that is important for PTM.

Sonodynamic therapy (SDT) is an emerging modality for cancer treatment which combines ultrasound with sonosensitizers to produce a localized cytotoxic effect. It has long been known that ultrasound exposure can cause both thermal and nonthermal bioeffects and it remains an open question to what degree does temperature impact the efficacy of SDT. In order to optimize the ultrasound parameters of SDT, transcranial MRIguided focused ultrasound (MRgFUS) and realtime MRI thermometry were used to monitor the therapy in a rat brain tumor model. Experiments were performed using a C6 intracranial glioma tumor model in 37 male Sprague Dawley rats. Treatments were performed about 7 days following tumor implantation when the tumor reached 13 mm in diameter as determined by MRI. 5aminolevulinic acid (5ALA) was injected at a dose of 60 mgkg six hours before sonication. MRgFUS at 1.06 MHz was delivered continuously at an in situ spatialpeak temporalaverage intensity of 5.5 Wcm2 for 20 min. MR thermometry was acquired to monitor the temperature change in the brain during sonication. The tumor growth response for animals receiving 5ALA alone, FUS alone, 5ALA  FUS and a sham control group were evaluated with MRI every week following treatment. During 20 min of MRgFUS at 5.5 Wcm2, the temperature within the targeted brain tumor was elevated from 32.3  0.5 C and 37.2  0.7 C to 33.2  0.9 C and 38.4  1.1 C, respectively. Both the tumor growth inhibition and survival were significantly improved in the 5ALA  FUS group with 32 C or 37 C as the starting core body (rectal) temperature. 5ALA alone and FUS alone did not improve survival. These promising results indicate that relatively low power continuous wave transcranial MRgFUS in conjunction with 5ALA can produce an inhibitory effect on rat brain tumor growth in the absence of thermal dose. Further investigation of the ultrasound parameters is needed to improve the therapeutic efficacy of MRgFUS and 5ALA.", "authors": "ShengKai Wu; Marc A. Santos; Stuart L.

The waveparticle duality phenomenon, which shares the same origin, has a strong relationship with quantum coherence. Recently, an elegant relation between quantum coherence and path information has been theoretically derived. Here, we experimentally test such new duality by l1norm measure and the minimumerror state discrimination. We prepare three classes of twophoton states encoded in polarisation degree of freedom, with one photon serving as the target and the other photon as the detector. We observe that waveparticlelike complementarity and Bagan's equality, defined by the duality relation between coherence and path information, is well satisfied. Our results may shed new light on the original nature of waveparticle duality and on the applications of quantum coherence as a fundamental resource in quantum technologies. Quantum coherence represents one of the most fundamental features in quantum mechanics and is closely linked to the concept of waveparticle duality.

Applications of Ni silicides span numerous areas and have the potential to be used as new functionalities. However, the magnetic properties of ultrathin Ni layers on silicon surfaces and related chemical compositions at the interface are not fully understood and the influence of Ag additives on the reactivity of NiSi(111) remain unclear. We report herein on the fact that the dominant species produced at the interface is NiSi, which is produced by the spontaneous formation of strong bonds between Ni and Si atoms. Assuming that a Ni layer is formed over a NiSi layer with the total coverage as a constraint, we established a chemical shiftrelated concentration model that, in effect, represents a practical method for determining the amount of ultrathin Ni silicides that are produced at the buried interface. The formation of AgSi particles provide a viable strategy for enhancing silicide formation via a specific interaction transfer mechanism, even at room temperature. The mechanism is related to differences in the enthalpies of formation HAgSi, HNiAg, and HNiSi, for these phases and provides insights into strategies for producing ultrathin silicides at a buried interface.", "authors": "ChengHsunTony Chang; PeiCheng Jiang; YuTing Chow; HsiLien Hsiao; WeiBin Su; JyhShen Tsay", "keywords": "Magnetic properties and materials; Nanoparticles; Surfaces, interfaces and thin films", "organization_affiliated": "Department of Physics, National Taiwan Normal University, Taipei, Taiwan; Institute of Physics, Academia Sinica, Taipei, Taiwan; Department of Electronic Engineering, Minghsin University of Science and Technology, Hsinchu, Taiwan; Department of Physics, National Taiwan Normal University, Taipei, Taiwan; Institute of Physics, Academia Sinica, Taipei, Taiwan; Department of Physics, National Taiwan Normal University, Taipei, Taiwan; Department of Physics, Tunghai University, Taichung, Taiwan; Institute of Physics, Academia Sinica, Taipei, Taiwan; Department of Physics, National Taiwan Normal University, Taipei, Taiwan"}

However, the use of magnetorheological fluids in practical applications has been limited by poor sedimentation ratio and onstate yield stress. Herein, we report hybrid rGOMoS2 additives for a highperformance magnetorheological fluid. Two different kinds of hybrid additives, which are called nonmagnetic rGOMoS2 and magnetic FerGOMoS2, were synthesized by using a hydrothermal method. The rGOMoS2 added suspensions remained stable for the first 90 min whereas the CIP MRFs settled down quickly (65%) in the first 10 minutes. The FerGOMoS2 additives showed a 24% higher onstate shear stress as compared to CIP MRFs. On the other hand, an increase of 60% in the onstate yield stress for FerGOMoS2 MRF can be attributed to the gapfilling by the hybrid additives during columnarstructure formation. Among twodimensional (2D) materials, Molybdenum Disulphide (MoS2) is a member of transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs), traditionally used as solid lubricant, while reduced grapheneoxide (rGO) is a wellknown 2D material with supreme mechanical properties.

Increasing the number of QDs, the device can span more than 1.02 m (O, C, S, and L bands) using only one type of material for all QDs, and is not restricted to this limit in case of using more QD groups. Also, it can manipulate the optical gain peak value, spectral coverage, and resonant energy for customized optical windows, among which 1.31 m and 1.55 m are simulated as widelyapplicable cases for model validation. This makes the device a prominent candidate for ultrawidebandwidth and also customizedgain applications in general. Variation impact of homogeneous and inhomogeneous broadenings, injection current and number of QD groups on optical gain are explained in detail. Besides proposing a design procedure for implementation of an ultrabroadband optical gain using superimposed QDs in solutionprocessed technology, the proposed gain engineering idea using this technology provides practically infinite bandwidth and an easy way to realize.

Herein, we further evaluated the genetic contribution of the QTL to cIMT by resequencing. We sequenced all exons within the QTL and genomic regions of PRiMA1, FOXN3 and CCDC88C in Dominican families with evidence for linkage to the QTL.

Here we use phylogenetic comparative techniques to show that mammal vocal characteristics and hearing sensitivity have coevolved to utilise higher frequencies in forest environments  opposite to the general prediction that lower frequencies should be favoured in acoustically cluttered habitats. We also reveal an evolutionary tradeoff between high frequency hearing sensitivity and the production of calls with high frequency acoustic energy that suggests forest mammals further optimise vocal communication according to their high frequency hearing sensitivity. Our results provide clear evidence of adaptive signal and sensory system coevolution. They also emphasize how constraints imposed by the signalling environment can jointly shape vocal signal structure and auditory systems, potentially driving acoustic diversity and reproductive isolation. Sensory drive theory predicts that vocal signalling coevolves with auditory sensitivity, but empirical evidence is limited.

In this study, a skarn iron deposit from northwest (NW) China is shown to have UPb garnet and UPb zircon ages of 254.2  1.7 Ma and 255.5  1.0 Ma, respectively, which are both significantly younger than magmatism and metamorphism of the region. This skarn age instead correlates with the occurrence of strikeslip and thrust faulting in the region. The waterrock mass ratio of 0.065~0.115 suggests the 18O garnet composition is ~1 at temperatures ranging from 250450 C. The low oxygen isotopic composition indicates the role of meteoric water in the garnet formation. These measurements can be interpreted as the shear along faults circulating meteoric water ~10 km below the hanging wall of metavolcanic sedimentary rock. Meteoric water in this hydrothermal system would leach cations from the metavolcanosedimentary rocks necessary for mineralization. Silicarich hydrothermal fluid reacts with calcicrich materials in the metavolcanosedimentary rocks, depositing the garnet and magnetite. Our work suggests that the shear zone is rich in ores, rendering this deposit for NW China a prospective source for future mineral resource exploration.", "authors": "Zhongjiang Zang; Leilei Dong; Wei Liu; Han Zhao; Xinshui Wang; Keda Cai; Bo Wan", "keywords": "Geochemistry; Mineralogy", "organization_affiliated": "Faculty of Earth Resources, China University of Geosciences, Wuhan, China; State Key Laboratory of Lithospheric Evolution, Institute of Geology and Geophysics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China; College of Earth and Planetary Sciences, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China; Key Laboratory of DeepEarth Dynamics, Institute of Geology, Chinese Academy of Geological Sciences, Beijing, China; State Key Laboratory of Lithospheric Evolution, Institute of Geology and Geophysics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China; College of Earth and Planetary Sciences, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China; State Key Laboratory of Lithospheric Evolution, Institute of Geology and Geophysics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China; College of Earth and Planetary Sciences, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China; Key Laboratory of Mineral Resources, Institute of Geology and Geophysics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China; State Key Laboratory of Geological Processes and Mineral Resources, and School of Earth Science and Resources, China University of Geosciences, Beijing, China; State Key Laboratory of Lithospheric Evolution, Institute of Geology and Geophysics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China; College of Earth and Planetary Sciences, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China"}

To better understand the effects that exposure to Mn2 exert on eukaryotic cell biology, we exposed a nonessential deletion library of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae to a subinhibitory concentration of Mn2 followed by targeted functional analyses of the positive hits. This screen produced a set of 43 sensitive deletion mutants that were enriched for genes associated with protein biosynthesis. Our followup investigations demonstrated that Mn reduced total rRNA levels in a dosedependent manner and decreased expression of a galactosidase reporter gene. This was subsequently supported by analysis of ribosome profiles that suggested Mninduced toxicity was associated with a reduction in formation of active ribosomes on the mRNAs. Altogether, these findings contribute to the current understanding of the mechanism of Mntriggered cytotoxicity.

We identified the lead compounds K542 and K405 with a selective inhibition of cell viability against sphingosine1phosphate lyase 1 (SGPL1)transduced ES2 cells by phenotypic screening. We therefore performed an in vivo pharmacological examination and observed the antitumor activity of K542 in an HT1080 tumorbearing mouse xenograft model.

We therefore synthesized the affinity probe Indtag derived from K542 and identified the proteins binding to Indtag via a pulldown experiment. Proteomics and biochemical analyses revealed that the target molecule of these lead compounds was Nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (NAMPT). We established K542resistant DLD1 and HT1080 cells, and genetic analyses of these cells identified a missense mutation in the NAMPTencoding gene.

Hence, developing an accurate and efficient method to predict the association between circRNA and disease may be beneficial to disease prevention, diagnosis, and treatment. Here, we propose a computational method named KATZCPDA, which is based on the KATZ method and the integrations among circRNAs, proteins, and diseases to predict circRNAdisease associations. KATZCPDA not only verifies existing circRNAdisease associations but also predicts unknown associations. As demonstrated by leaveoneout and 10fold crossvalidation, KATZCPDA achieves AUC values of 0.959 and 0.958, respectively. The performance of KATZCPDA was substantially higher than those of previously developed networkbased methods. To further demonstrate the effectiveness of KATZCPDA, we apply KATZCPDA to predict the associated circRNAs of Colorectal cancer, glioma, breast cancer, and Tuberculosis.

SQLNSplus additionally contained the LCPUFAs arachidonic acid (AA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), lysine, phytase and other nutrients. Plasma total phospholipid FA composition (% of total FAs) was measured at baseline (n  353) and at 12 months (n  293).

However, the distinct role of the two COX isoforms in these processes still remains unclear. Using three characterized mouse lines where the Ptgs1 and Ptgs2 genes substitute for one another, this study focused on the reproductive significance of their distinct roles and potential biological substitution. In both nongravid and gravid uteri, the knockin COX2 is expressed constitutively, whereas the knockin COX1 is slightly induced in early implantation. The delayed onset of parturition previously found in COX1 null mice was corrected by COX2 exchange in COX2COX1 mice, with normal term pregnancy, gestation length and litter size. In contrast, loss of native COX2 in COX1COX2 mice resulted in severely impaired reproductive functions. Knockin COX1 failed to substitute for the loss of COX2 in COX1COX2 mice during implantation, indicating that COX1 may be replaced by COX2, but not vice versa. A panel of prostaglandins detected in uterus and ovary demonstrates that prostaglandin biosynthesis preferentially depends on native COX1, but not COX2. More interestingly, preferential compensations by the COX isoforms were sustained despite weak dependency on their role in prostaglandin biosynthesis in the uterus and ovary.", "authors": "Xinzhi Li; Laurel L.

The presence of O2 was essential for the catalytic oxidation of 2,6DMHQ and the generation of H2O2. Moreover, the higher reduction potential of ferrihydrite relative to that of goethite made the former species more susceptible to reductive dissolution, which favored the production of OH.

Little is known about social influence coming from a minority group. To test whether social pressure from sexual minorities triggers avoidancemotivated behaviors, we explored how being influenced by the preferences of gay peers modifies the behavioral and neural reactivity of individuals defined as in vs. out groups on the basis of sexual orientation. To this aim, we combined fMRI with a social conformity paradigm in which heterosexual and gaybisexual (hereafter nonexclusively heterosexual, NEH) individuals provided with male body attractiveness ratings by a fictitious group of gay students may or may not alter their previous rating and may or may not conform to the mean. Behaviorally, conformity to the minority preference was found in ingroup NEH more than in outgroup heterosexuals. Analysis of BOLD signal showed that social pressure brought about increased brain activity in frontal and parietal regions associated with the detection of social conflict. These results show that members of a sexual majority group display a smaller level of conformity when a sexual minority group exerts social influence.

The DVT and PE risks were significantly increased in patients receiving combined androgen blockade (CAB) compared with the counterpart ADT nonrecipients. After adjusting for potential risk factors, PCa patients receiving CAB had the highest PE risk (HR  3.11), followed by DVT risk (HR  2.53). The DVT risk remained elevated throughout the entire duration of chemical castration. However, high PE risk was observed in patients with 720day treatment duration.

Both proteins contain a bromodomain (BrD) adjacent to the histone acetyl transferase (HAT) catalytic domain, which serves as a promising drug target for cancers and immune system disorders. Several potent and selective smallmolecule inhibitors targeting CBP BrD have been reported, but thus far smallmolecule inhibitors targeting BrD outside of the BrD and extraterminal domain (BET) family are especially lacking. Here, we established and optimized a TRFRETbased highthroughput screening platform for the CBP BrD and acetylated H4 peptide. Through an HTS assay against an inhouse chemical library containing 20 000 compounds, compound DC_CP20 was discovered as a novel CBP BrD inhibitor with an IC50 value of 744.3 nM. This compound bound to CBP BrD with a KD value of 4.01 M in the surface plasmon resonance assay. Molecular modeling revealed that DC_CP20 occupied the Kacbinding region firmly through hydrogen bonding with the conserved residue N1168. At the celluslar level, DC_CP20 dosedependently inhibited the proliferation of human leukemia MV411 cells with an IC50 value of 19.2 M and markedly downregulated the expression of the cMyc in the cells. Taken together, the discovery of CBP BrD inhibitor DC_CP20 provides a novel chemical scaffold for further medicinal chemistry optimization and a potential chemical probe for CBPrelated biological function research. In addition, this inhibitor may serve as a promising therapeutic strategy for MLL leukemia by targeting CBP BrD protein.", "authors": "Fengcai Zhang; Zhongya Sun; Liping Liao; Yu Zuo; Dan Zhang; Jun Wang; Yantao Chen; Senhao Xiao; Hao Jiang; Tian Lu; Pan Xu; Liyan Yue; Daohai Du; Hao Zhang; Chuanpeng Liu; Cheng Luo", "keywords": "Biomedicine, general; PharmacologyToxicology; Medical Microbiology; Immunology; Internal Medicine; Vaccine", "organization_affiliated": "School of Pharmacy, Nanchang University, Nanchang, China; School of Life and Technology, Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, China; Drug Discovery and Design Center, CAS Key Laboratory of Receptor Research, State Key Laboratory of Drug Research, Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai, China; Drug Discovery and Design Center, CAS Key Laboratory of Receptor Research, State Key Laboratory of Drug Research, Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai, China; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China; School of Pharmacy, Nanchang University, Nanchang, China; Drug Discovery and Design Center, CAS Key Laboratory of Receptor Research, State Key Laboratory of Drug Research, Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai, China; Drug Discovery and Design Center, CAS Key Laboratory of Receptor Research, State Key Laboratory of Drug Research, Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai, China; Department of Pharmacy, Guizhou University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Guiyang, China; Drug Discovery and Design Center, CAS Key Laboratory of Receptor Research, State Key Laboratory of Drug Research, Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai, China; Jiangsu Key Laboratory for High Technology Research of TCM Formulae, Nanjing University of Chinese Medicine, Nanjing, China; Drug Discovery and Design Center, CAS Key Laboratory of Receptor Research, State Key Laboratory of Drug Research, Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai, China; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China; Drug Discovery and Design Center, CAS Key Laboratory of Receptor Research, State Key Laboratory of Drug Research, Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai, China; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China; Drug Discovery and Design Center, CAS Key Laboratory of Receptor Research, State Key Laboratory of Drug Research, Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai, China; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China; Drug Discovery and Design Center, CAS Key Laboratory of Receptor Research, State Key Laboratory of Drug Research, Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai, China; Jiangsu Key Laboratory for High Technology Research of TCM Formulae, Nanjing University of Chinese Medicine, Nanjing, China; Drug Discovery and Design Center, CAS Key Laboratory of Receptor Research, State Key Laboratory of Drug Research, Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai, China; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China; Drug Discovery and Design Center, CAS Key Laboratory of Receptor Research, State Key Laboratory of Drug Research, Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai, China; Drug Discovery and Design Center, CAS Key Laboratory of Receptor Research, State Key Laboratory of Drug Research, Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai, China; Jiangsu Key Laboratory for High Technology Research of TCM Formulae, Nanjing University of Chinese Medicine, Nanjing, China; Drug Discovery and Design Center, CAS Key Laboratory of Receptor Research, State Key Laboratory of Drug Research, Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai, China; School of Life and Technology, Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, China; Drug Discovery and Design Center, CAS Key Laboratory of Receptor Research, State Key Laboratory of Drug Research, Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai, China; Department of Pharmacy, Guizhou University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Guiyang, China; Jiangsu Key Laboratory for High Technology Research of TCM Formulae, Nanjing University of Chinese Medicine, Nanjing, China"}

Because of the high empirical utility of expert experience, the consistency, science and inheritance of such experience are continuously in dispute. To explore the scientific evidence for this subjective method, we designed a Delphi expert investigation coupled with chemical analysis to evaluate the quality of Schisandrae Chinensis Fructus (SCF). Initially, 13 experts were invited to independently evaluate the grades of 11 batches of SCF. After screening the consistency and repeatability of the evaluation results, typical samples of all quality levels were identified. Seven significant physical characters were detected; colour and size were found to be the key parameters for identifying SCF quality. Based on this correlation, a decision tree model was ultimately established and converted to a quality evaluation card. Over 80% consistency in a novice test demonstrated the technical advantages and application characteristics of the model. Further correlation analysis revealed that EQA quality grades of SCF were positively correlated to the content of polysaccharides and polyphenols, while negatively correlated to the content of lignans. Biological activities were also approving it.

It is numerically shown that the proposed perfect absorber outperforms the previously proposed schemes in fabrication tolerance. According to the rigorous coupled wave analysis (RCWA) and coupled mode theory (CMT) fitting, over a considerably wide range of grating width and thickness, the proposed absorber provides a proper ratio of leakage rate to loss rate while preserving resonant condition, so that almost perfect absorption (99.9%) can be obtained. This result is attributed to the strong electric field confinement in the DBR region rather than the grating layer owing to lower index of grating compared to DBR. In addition, without degrading the fabrication tolerance, the bandwidth of the proposed absorber can be controlled by the DBR thickness (the number of pairs) and a narrow absorbing bandwidth of subnanometer is achieved with 8.5 SiSiO2 pair stacked DBR.", "authors": "Sangjun Lee; Hyungjun Heo; Sangin Kim", "keywords": "Optical properties and devices; Optoelectronic devices and components", "organization_affiliated": "Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Ajou University, Suwon, South Korea; Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Ajou University, Suwon, South Korea; Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Ajou University, Suwon, South Korea"}

PCC0104005 blocks MK801induced hyperactivity in rats, consistent with the reduction in dopamine D2 receptor stimulation and increased dopamine release in the medial prefrontal cortex.

Our previous study showed that LPLUNC1 upregulates Prohibitin 1 (PHB1), a pleiotropic protein that functions as a tumour suppressor gene in various cancers. Low expression of PHB1 was also found to be associated with the poor prognosis of NPC patients. However, the mechanisms by which LPLUNC1 upregulates PHB1 and the potential role of PHB1 in NPC are unclear. Here, we found that LPLUNC1 stabilised PHB1 by inhibiting PHB1 ubiquitination, which is mediated by E3 ligase TRIM21. LPLUNC1 competitively impaired the binding of PHB1 to TRIM21 due to its stronger binding affinity to PHB1, suppressing the ubiquitination of PHB1. Therefore, our study indicates that PHB1 acted as a tumour suppressor gene by inhibiting NFB activity. Depletion of PHB1 significantly attenuated the antitumour effects of LPLUNC1 in NPC cells, and the inhibitory effect of LPLUNC1 on NFB activity was thus reversed.

For the second point, the isotope fractionation can be explained by the classical mechanical collisions between pairs of particles.

Here, we examined the antitumor effects of CMLD2 in four thyroid cancer cell lines (SW1736, 8505 C, BCPAP and K1). Indeed, CMLD2 competitively binds HuR protein disrupting its interaction with RNAtargets. 35 M CLMD2 produced a significant downregulation in thyroid cancer cell viability, coupled to an increase in apoptosis. Moreover, CMLD2 treatment hindered both migration and colony formation ability. MAD2 is a microtubulesassociated protein known to be greatly overexpressed in cancer and correlating with tumor aggressiveness. Furthermore, MAD2 is known to be a HuR target. CMLD2 treatment induced a strong MAD2 downregulation and rescue experiments depicted it as a key effector in HuRmediated in cancer.

Strong currents interacting with manmade structures can generate complex threedimensional wakes that can make prey more accessible. Whether localised wakes from manmade structures can generate predictable foraging hotspots for top predators is unknown. Here we address this question by quantifying the relative use of an anthropogenicallygenerated wake by surface foraging seabirds, verified using drone transects and hydroacoustics. We show that the wake of a tidal energy structure promotes a localised and persistent foraging hotspot, with seabird numbers greatly exceeding those at adjacent natural wake features. The wake mixes material throughout the water column, potentially acting like a prey conveyer belt. Our findings highlight the importance of identifying the physical scales and mechanisms underlying predator hotspot formation when assessing the ecological consequences of installing or removing anthropogenic structures.

Our limited understanding of the pathogenic mechanisms involved in these diseases currently hinders early diagnosis and the development of more specific and effective therapies. The past years have been marked by considerable progress in our insight of the genetic basis of many diseases. In particular, genomewide association studies (GWAS) performed with thousands of patients have provided detailed information about the genetic variants associated with a large number of chronic inflammatory diseases. These studies have brought to the forefront many genes linked to signaling pathways that were not previously known to be involved in pathogenesis, pointing to new directions in the study of disease mechanisms. GWAS also provided fundamental evidence for a key role of the immune system in the pathogenesis of these diseases, because many of the identified loci map to genes involved in different immune processes. However, the mechanisms by which diseaseassociated genetic variants act on disease development and the targeted cell populations remain poorly understood. The challenge of the postGWAS era is to understand how these variants affect pathogenesis, to allow translation of genetic data into better diagnostics and innovative treatment strategies.

Furthermore, few studies have referred to vulnerable ecosystems with low biomass and biodiversity. In this research, a field study was conducted to investigate the effects of wind farms on the individual traits, community structures and ecosystem functions of Gobi Desert ecosystems. The effects were measured by comparing interfering areas (IAs, located between 40 m and 90 m in the downstream direction of the wind turbine) with noninterfering areas (NIAs, located over 200 m from the wind turbine matrixes). The results showed that (1) plant individuals in IAs were less stressed and in better physiological states than those in NIAs; (2) for community structures, IA plants tended to be shorter and denser and had a higher coverage condition than that of NIA plants; and (3) ecosystem functions in IAs were significantly improved due to the existence of shrubs and higher biomass.

The 3D structure and atomic level proteinligand interactions are currently unknown. Here, the 3D dimeric structure of BADH2 was modeled using homology modeling. Furthermore, two 0.5 s simulations were performed to explore the nature of BADH2 dimer structurally and dynamically. Each monomer comprises of 3 domains (substratebinding, NADbinding, and oligomerization domains). The NADbinding domain is the most mobile. A scissorlike motion was observed between the monomers. Inside the binding pocket, N162 and E260 are tethered by strong hydrogen bonds to residues in close proximity. In contrast, the catalytic C294 is very mobile and interacts occasionally with N162. The flexibility of the nucleophilic C294 could facilitate the attack of free carbonyl on an aldehyde substrate. Key intersubunit salt bridges contributing to dimerization were also identified. E487, D491, E492, K498, and K502 were found to form strong salt bridges with charged residues on the adjacent monomer.

The attention is focused on prefibrillar oligomers (PFOs), formed in the early stages and supposed to be neurotoxic. PFOs structure may change due to their instability and different experimental protocols. Consequently, it is difficult to ascertain which aggregation species are actually neurotoxic. We used salmon Calcitonin (sCT) as an amyloid model whose slow aggregation rate allowed to prepare stable samples without photochemical crosslinking. Intracellular Ca2 rise plays a fundamental role in amyloid proteininduced neurodegerations. Two paradigms have been explored: (i) the \"membrane permeabilization\" due to the formation of amyloid pores or other types of membrane damage; (ii) \"receptormediated\" modulation of Ca2 channels. In the present paper, we tested the effects of native sCT PFOs with respect to Monomerenriched solutions in neurons characterized by an increasing degree of differentiation, in terms of Ca2influx, cellular viability, LongTerm Potentiation impairment, PostSynaptic Densities and synaptophysin expression. Results indicated that PFOs, but not Monomerenriched solutions, induced abnormal Ca2influx, which could only in part be ascribed to NMDAR activation.

This study addresses changes in onecarbon indices over pregnancy and the relationship between maternal and child DNA methylation and metabolite concentrations by leveraging data from 24 motherinfant dyads. Five of the 13 metabolites measured from maternal blood and methylation levels of 993 CpG sites changed over the course of pregnancy. In dyads, maternal and fetal onecarbon concentrations were highly correlated, both early in pregnancy and at delivery. The 993 CpG sites whose methylation levels changed over pregnancy in maternal blood were also investigated for associations with metabolite concentrations in infant blood at delivery, where five CpG sites were associated with the concentration of at least one metabolite.

Here we provide a simple yet effective surface engineering strategy to improve both the transverse mechanical properties and the tribological property by coating PPTA fibers with ultrahigh molecular weight polyethylene (UHMWPE) embedded with silica nanoparticles. The coatedPPTA fiber shows remarkable enhancement in transverse mechanical properties including ~127% increase of Young's modulus, which is attributed to both the alignment of UHMWPE chains in the transverse direction and the embeded ceramic nanoparticles. Meanwhile, the surface friction of the coated fiber increases twofold as a result of the ceramic nanoparticles. In addition, the coated fibers exhibit an enhanced chemical resistance to external harsh environment. The improved transverse mechanical properties, surface frictional characteristics, and chemical resistance demonstrate that coating with UHMWPE and ceramic nanoparticles can be used as an effective approach to enhance the performance of PPTA and other highperformance polymer fibers for body armor applications.", "authors": "Zhuolei Zhang; Yao Zhao; Haoqi Li; Simona Percec; Jie Yin; Fei Ren", "keywords": "Mechanical engineering; Polymers", "organization_affiliated": "Department of Mechanical Engineering, Temple University, Philadelphia, USA; Temple Materials Institute, Temple University, Philadelphia, USA; Department of Mechanical Engineering, Temple University, Philadelphia, USA; Department of Mechanical Engineering, Temple University, Philadelphia, USA; Temple Materials Institute, Temple University, Philadelphia, USA; Department of Mechanical Engineering, Temple University, Philadelphia, USA; Department of Mechanical Engineering, Temple University, Philadelphia, USA"}

We found that the main reason for this metabolic capability is RpoS inactivation leading to the production of the citrate transporter CitT, exploited by NMEC for ferric citrate uptake dependent on YcgG2 (an allozyme with cdiGMP phosphodiesterase activity).", "authors": "Nikola Zlatkov; Bernt Eric Uhlin", "keywords": "Bacterial evolution; Molecular medicine", "organization_affiliated": "The Laboratory for Molecular Infection Medicine Sweden (MIMS), Department of Molecular Biology, Umea University, Umea, Sweden; The Laboratory for Molecular Infection Medicine Sweden (MIMS), Department of Molecular Biology, Umea University, Umea, Sweden"}

Herein, we used a comparative approach to assess the genetic variant burden and genotypephenotype correlations in four most common brain lesions in patients with drugresistant focal epilepsy. Targeted sequencing analysis was performed for a panel of 161 genes with a mean coverage of 400. Lesional tissue was histopathologically reviewed and dissected from hippocampal sclerosis (n  15), ganglioglioma (n  16), dysembryoplastic neuroepithelial tumors (n  8), and focal cortical dysplasia type II (n  15). Peripheral blood (n  12) or surgical tissue samples histopathologically classified as lesionfree (n  42) were available for comparison. Variants were classified as pathogenic or likely pathogenic according to American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics guidelines. Overall, we identified pathogenic and likely pathogenic variants in 25.9% of patients with a mean coverage of 383. The highest number of pathogeniclikely pathogenic variants was observed in patients with ganglioglioma (43.75%; all somatic) and dysembryoplastic neuroepithelial tumors (37.5%; all somatic), and in 20% of cases with focal cortical dysplasia type II (13.33% somatic, 6.67% germline). Pathogeniclikely pathogenic positive genes were disorder specific and BRAF V600E the only recurrent pathogenic variant. This study represents a reference for the genetic variant burden across the four most common lesion entities in patients with drugresistant focal epilepsy.

Our results demonstrated that there was a higher proportion of open flowers and mature fruits in the managed population than in the natural population. Pollen addition significantly increased seed number per flower, and pollen limitation was determined to be a significant limiting factor in seed production. Furthermore, Apis mellifera was determined to be the principal pollinator, and pollinator visitation frequency was significantly correlated with open flower number.

Zspectra of the brain have traditionally been analyzed for two most common saturation phenomena: downfield amide proton transfer (APT) and upfield nuclear Overhauser enhancement (NOE). However, a great body of brain metabolites, many of interest in neurology and oncology, contributes to the downfield saturation in Zspectra. The extraction of these \"hidden\" metabolites from Zspectra requires careful design of CEST sequences and data processing models, which is only possible by first obtaining CEST signatures of the brain metabolites possessing labile protons. In this work, we measured exchange rates of all majorforCEST brain metabolites in the physiological pH range at 37 C. Analysis of their contributions to Zspectra revealed that regardless of the main magnetic field strength and pH, five main contributors, i.e. myoinositol, creatine, phosphocreatine, glutamate, and mobile (poly)peptides, account for ca. 90% of downfield CEST effect.

However, little is known about changes in microbial abundance and community composition during lake ice formation and times of persistent ice cover. The goal of this study is to characterize temporal dynamics of microbial communities during ice formation and persistent ice cover. Samples were collected in triplicate, five days per week from surface water in the Keweenaw Waterway between November and April. Environmental conditions along with microbial abundance and microbial community composition was determined. Distinct community composition was found between icefree and icecovered time periods with significantly different community composition between months. The microbial community underwent dramatic shifts in microbial abundance and diversity during the transitions into and out of ice cover. The richness of the microbial community increased during times of ice cover. Relatives of microbes involved in nitrogen cycling bloomed during times of ice cover as sequences related to known nitrifying taxa were significantly enriched during ice cover. These results help to elucidate how microbial abundance and diversity change over drastic seasonal transitions and how ice cover may affect microbial abundance and diversity.", "authors": "Timothy M.

However, the refractive outcome is dependent on stromal remodelling of both the inlay and recipient stroma. This study aimed to investigate the refractive changes and tissue responses following implantation of 2.5mm biological inlays with or without corneal collagen crosslinking (CXL) in a rabbit model. Prior to implantation, rotational rheometry demonstrated an almost twofold increase in corneal stiffness after CXL. After implantation, haze gradually subsided in the CXLtreated inlays (p  0.001), whereas the untreated inlays preserved their clarity (p  0.75). Invivo confocal microscopy revealed reduced keratocyte cell count at the interface of the CXL inlays at week 8. Following initial steepening, regression was observed in anterior mean curvature from week 1 to 12, being most prominent for the nonCXL subgroups (nonCXL: 12.3  2.6D vs CXL: 2.3  4.4D at 90 m depth, p  0.03; nonCXL: 12.4  8.0D vs CXL: 5.0  4.0D at 120 m depth, p  0.22). Immunohistochemical analysis revealed comparable tissue responses in CXL and untreated subgroups.

Histone methylations have been implicated in renal tumorigenesis but their clinical significance and underlying pathology are unexplored. Here, we elucidated the histone 3 lysine 4 (H3K4) methylation patterns in clear cell RCC and its underlying pathology. Lower cellular levels of H3K4 monomethylation, dimethylation and trimethylation were fraternized with higher TNM staging and Fuhrman grading as well as tumor metastasis. Further, the expression profile of 20 H3K4 modifiers revealed the significant overexpression of histone demethylases compared to methyltransferases, indicating their role in the reduction of H3K4 methylation levels. In view of above facts, the role of LSD2 and KDM5A demethylases in RCC pathogenesis were explored using respective siRNAs. The RCC cells exhibited reduced cell viability after knockdown of LSD2 and KDM5A genes with concomitant induction of apoptosis. In addition, propidium iodide staining demonstrated an arrest of RCC cells at Sphase and subG1 phase of the cell cycle.

Trypsinogen can be activated to trypsin either through autoactivation (trypsinmediated trypsinogen activation) or by the lysosomal protease cathepsin B (CTSB). Experimental separation of CTSBmediated activation from autoactivation in mice is possible through knocking in mutations that render trypsinogen sensitive to CTSB but resistant to trypsin. Here we present biochemical studies on novel mouse cationic trypsinogen (isoform T7) mutants engineered for selective CTSB activation. First, we demonstrated that mutation K24G, which alters the activation site Lys in T7 trypsinogen, abolished autoactivation while activation by CTSB was stimulated 4fold at pH 4.0. Interestingly, CTSBmediated activation of the K24G mutant became more sensitive to inhibition by increasing pH. Next, Alascanning of the five Asp residues preceding the activation site Lys revealed that mutation D22A accelerated CTSBmediated activation by 2fold. Finally, combination of mutations D22A and K24G resulted in a trypsinogen mutant that exhibited 14fold increased activation by CTSB and normal pH sensitivity. We conclude that we successfully engineered a mouse T7 trypsinogen mutant (D22A,K24G), which is robustly activated by CTSB but cannot undergo autoactivation.

This study set out to quantify general practitioner (GP) and lung specialist attendance and diagnostic imaging in the leadup to a diagnosis of nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and identify common pathways to diagnosis in New South Wales (NSW), Australia. We used linked health data for participants of the 45 and Up Study (a NSW populationbased cohort study) diagnosed with NSCLC between 2006 and 2012. Our main outcome measures were GP and specialist attendances, Xrays and computed tomography (CT) scans of the chest and lung cancerrelated hospital admissions. Among our study cohort (N  894), 60% (n  536) had 4 GP attendances in the 3 months prior to diagnosis of NSCLC, 56% (n  505) had GPordered imaging (chest Xray or CT scan), 39% (N  349) attended a respiratory physician and 11% (N  102) attended a cardiothoracic surgeon. The two most common pathways to diagnosis, accounting for one in three people, included GP and lung specialist (respiratory physician or cardiothoracic surgeon) involvement. Overall, 25% of people (n  223) had an emergency hospital admission. For 14% of people (N  129), an emergency hospital admission was the only event identified on the pathway to diagnosis. We found little effect of remoteness of residence on access to services. This study identified a substantial proportion of people with NSCLC being diagnosed in an emergency setting. Further research is needed to establish whether there were barriers to the timely diagnosis of these cases. Examining events leading to the diagnosis of nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in Australia yields insights to guide further research and perhaps improve the pathways to diagnosis. NSCLC is by far the most common form of lung cancer. Researchers, led by the Cancer Institute New South Wales, investigated clinical care contacts leading to diagnosis, using a descriptive cohort study of 894 patients diagnosed between 2006 and 2012. The researchers quantified contact with GPs and lung specialists, hospital admissions and diagnostic imaging procedures. Living in remote locations had little influence on access to services. More than half of the patients did not see a lung specialist during the pathway to diagnosis, while a quarter received their diagnosis in an emergency setting.

We used a movementbased kernel density estimator to estimate home range at five spatial scales among deer across study areas. We developed 7 linear regression models that used measures of the configuration of the forested landscape to explain size of home range. We observed differences in size of home range between sexes among areas that differed based on landscape configuration. We documented size of home range changed with various metrics that identifying connectivity of forested patches. Generally, size of home range increased with an increasing proportion of homogenous forest.

Here we show that large surface patches (1000 km2) of the red colored copepod Calanus finmarchicus can be identified from satellite observations of ocean color. Such observations provide the most comprehensive view of the distribution of a zooplankton species to date, and alter our understanding of the behavior of this key zooplankton species.

Natural convection is caused due to buoyancy forced which has been induced because of temperature and concentration gradients. The general condition of velocity has been considered on the plate surface with Newtonian heating and constant wall concentration. The effect of thermal radiation is also considered in the energy equation. The main objective here is to study the relative behavior of the magnetic field. That is the magnetic field shows two types of relative behavior. More exactly, when the magnetic field is fixed relative to the fluid (MFFRF) and the magnetic field is fixed relative to the plate (MFFRP). The general exact solution of the problem is determined by the Laplace transform method. Particular solutions for two special cases namely the plate with variable vibration and the plate with sine and cosine oscillations are also determined. Moreover, the solutions when    for both cases i.e. MFFRF and MFFRP are also obtained as special cases. The velocity profile is presented in the form of mechanical, thermal and concentration components. Velocity obtained for oscillating plate condition is written in terms of steadystate and transient parts. Exact solutions obtained in this paper are interpreted graphically using computational software Mathcad15 to examine the effects of various pertinent parameters such as Casson fluid parameter, the permeability of porous medium, chemical reaction parameter, heat generation parameter, buoyancy force parameter, magnetic parameter, and radiation parameter.

Notch receptors 1 to 4 were detected by immunohistochemistry in the parenchyma and stroma of the developing gland. The subcellular localization of the four receptors was predominantly cytoplasmic except for NOTCH4, which was mostly nuclear. The membrane and the active intracellular domains of NOTCH paralogues were identified by western blot. NOTCH1 and NOTCH2 active domains increased during pubertal stages while NOTCH3 and NOTCH4 active domains decreased, suggesting strikingly different involvement of NOTCH paralogues in bovine mammary gland development and differentiation. The mRNA expression levels of the target genes HEY1 and HEY2 increased during peripuberty whereas no variation of HES1 mRNA levels was observed.

As live poxviruses may cause adverse reactions in vaccinated animals, it is imperative to develop new diagnostic tools for the differentiation of SPPV field strains from attenuated vaccine strains. Within the capripoxvirus (CaPV) homolog of the variola virus B22R gene, we identified a unique region in SPPV vaccines with two deletions of 21 and 27 nucleotides and developed a HighResolution Melting (HRM)based assay. The HRM assay produces four distinct melting peaks, enabling the differentiation between SPPV vaccines, SPPV field isolates, GTPV and LSDV. This HRM assay is sensitive, specific, and provides a costeffective means for the detection and classification of CaPVs and the differentiation of SPPV vaccines from SPPV field isolates.", "authors": "Tesfaye Rufael Chibssa; Tirumala Bharani K.

However, some men have additional pathology present such as Peyronie's Disease, penile shortening, penoscrotal webbing, buried penis or other penoscrotal anatomical abnormalities that may be addressed at the time of prosthesis implantation. Although several techniques are described, there remains a lack of data regarding the outcomes. We sought to identify the results of available literature regarding the additional procedures performed at the time of penile prosthesis implantation that provide defined surgical outcomes rather than merely describe surgical techniques. Surgical outcomes to procedures provide more realistic clinical outcome for readers than simply the description of novel techniques or expert opinions. We performed a review of the MEDLINE database to identify additional procedures performed in conjunction with penile prosthesis placement. Many procedures are described in review articles, however, with limited data regarding their outcomes. The included articles must describe additional procedures performed in conjunction with penile prosthesis placement. Perioperative office techniques and management were included if it changed the surgical technique. All abstracts obtained through search criteria were reviewed. Only articles written in English, on human subjects with documented surgical results and relevant articles were included in this study. After a thorough literature search, a total of 24 articles were identified. Penile lengthening procedures at the time of penile prosthesis comprise most of the literature on this subject. Lengthening procedures are as simple as Peyronie's plaque excision and grafting to complex sliding and lengthening procedures requiring complete neurovascular bundle and partial urethral mobilization. Additionally, aggressive cylinder sizing and prolonged postoperative cycling at home are also described. Glanulopexy may be necessary when malpositioning of the glans is present. Other options such as scrotoplasty are also available options for those patients with scrotal webs. Notably there is a paucity of published literature regarding girth enhancement, buried penis repair, hernia repair, and vasectomy at time of penile prosthesis placement. There are numerous procedures that can be performed in the same operative setting as penile prosthesis. Although the procedures do have a common goal to provide optimal postoperative natural appearance, length, straightness, girth and function, the techniques employed must be tailored to each patient as there is not a oneprocedure fits all in this patient population.", "authors": "Patrick Whelan; Laurence A.

At 10 years, we assessed BMI, fat mass index (FMI) based on total body fat by dualenergy Xray absorptiometry, and abdominal subcutaneous, visceral and pericardial fat mass indices, and liver fat fraction by Magnetic Resonance Imaging. A higher centraltototal subcutaneous fat ratio at 1.5 months only and higher total subcutaneous fat at 6 and 24 months were associated with higher BMI, FMI and subcutaneous fat mass index at 10 years.

Although well accepted as the product of adaptation, the dynamics underlying the evolutionary buildup of complex adaptive systems remains poorly resolved. Using simulated robot swarms that exhibit antlike group foraging with trail pheromones, we show that their selforganizing capacity paradoxically involves regulatory behavior that arises in advance. We focus on a traffic rule on their foraging trail as a regulatory trait. We allow the simulated robot swarms to evolve pheromone responsiveness and traffic rules simultaneously. In most cases, the traffic rule, initially arising as selectively neutral component behaviors, assists the group foraging system to bypass a fitness valley caused by overcrowding on the trail. Our study reveals a hitherto underappreciated role of regulatory mechanisms in the origin of complex adaptive systems, as well as highlights the importance of embodiment in the study of their evolution.

We examined the correlation between NRFS and difficulty in holding a baby, and the amount of crying in the one month after birth, which was considered an indicator of the newborn's temperament. We divided the cases with NRFS into positive NRFS and false positive NRFS. NRFS was associated with bad mood, frequent crying for a long duration, and intense crying. After adjustment for other covariates, NRFS was associated with bad mood (odds ratio, OR  1.15, 95% confidence interval, CI  1.001.33), and intense crying (1.12, 1.021.24). In the multivariable model, positive and false positive NRFS were not clearly associated with neonatal irritability.

Herein, we investigated the antiproliferative potential of Urtica dioica L. extract (UD) against NSCLC cell models with low sensitivity to cisplatin, a cytotoxic agent largely employed to cure NSCLCs. UD inhibited cell proliferation in the selected cells, while no toxic effects were observed in normal lung cells. Furthermore, the cotreatment of UD and cisplatin notably sensitised NSCLC cells to cisplatin. Mechanistically, we discovered that UDpromoted endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress via activation of the growth arrest and DNA damageinducible gene 153 (GADD153) triggering apoptosis.

Intraoperative bleeding as the main complication is also the primary cause of conversion from laparoscopic to open splenectomy. Intraoperative blood salvage can reduce transfusion requirements, decrease the conversion rate to open, and promote fasttracking in laparoscopic splenectomy (LS). From November 2007 through December 2016 we collected medical data of 115 LS patients. There were three groups: 54 patients receiving routine care (we marks them as Group RT), 33 patients with fasttrack care (Group FT), and 28 receiving fasttrack care receiving intraoperative splenic blood salvage and autotransfusion (Group FT  ISBS). These medical data are comprised of included three phases (pre, intra, and postoperative). There were significant differences (P  0.05) between RT, FT, and FT  ISBS groups. The hemoglobin level in Group FT  ISBS was significantly higher than in Group RT and Group FT. Comparing the duration of hospital stay of 3 groups, Group RT stayed for a significantly longer time than Group FT and Group FT  ISBS, Group FT  ISBSmuch shorter than Group FT. Comparing the hospitalization expense, GroupFT  ISBS significantly expended less than Group RT and Group FT. Our study shows that laparoscopic splenectomy with fasttrack care is feasible, effective, and safe for patients who require splenectomy.

Recent studies have shown that doublestrand DNA breaks (DSBs) are repaired in a transcriptioncoupled manner. Active transcription results in a faster recruitment of DSB repair factors and expedites DNA repair. On the other hand, transcription is repressed by DNA damage through multiple mechanisms. We previously reported that TLP, a TATA boxbinding protein (TBP) family member that functions as a transcriptional regulator, is also involved in DNA damageinduced apoptosis. However, the mechanism by which TLP affects DNA damage response was largely unknown. Here we show that TLPmediated global transcriptional repression after DSBs is crucial for apoptosis induction by DNAdamaging agents such as etoposide and doxorubicin. Compared to control cells, TLPknockdown cells were resistant to etoposideinduced apoptosis and exhibited an elevated level of global transcription after etoposide exposure. DSBs were efficiently removed in transcriptionally hyperactive TLPknockdown cells. However, forced transcriptional shutdown using transcriptional inhibitors amanitin and 5,6dichloro1Dribofuranosylbenzimidazole (DRB) slowed down DSB repair and resensitized TLPknockdown cells to etoposide. Taken together, these results indicate that TLP is a critical determinant as to how cells respond to DSBs and triggers apoptosis to cells that have sustained DNA damage.", "authors": "Hidefumi Suzuki; Mayumi OkamotoKatsuyama; Tetsufumi Suwa; Ryo Maeda; Takaaki Tamura; Yuki Yamaguchi", "keywords": "Apoptosis; DNA damage response; Transcription", "organization_affiliated": "School of Life Science and Technology, Tokyo Institute of Technology, Yokohama, Japan; School of Life Science and Technology, Tokyo Institute of Technology, Yokohama, Japan; School of Life Science and Technology, Tokyo Institute of Technology, Yokohama, Japan; Graduate School of Science, Chiba University, Chiba, Japan; Graduate School of Science, Chiba University, Chiba, Japan; School of Life Science and Technology, Tokyo Institute of Technology, Yokohama, Japan"}

To investigate fitness costs, a near isogenic M. domestica resistant strain (SpinR) was constructed using SpinUNSELsusceptible and SpinSELresistant strains sharing a close genetic background. We found significantly reduced rates of adult eclosion, fecundity, egg hatching, survival, and lengthened developmental time in the SpinR strain. Moreover, the values of different fitness parameters like biotic potential, mean relative growth rate, intrinsic rate of natural increase, and net reproductive rate, were also significantly reduced in the SpinR strain, which reflect fitness costs most probably linked with spinosad resistance. The presence of fitness costs suggests likely instability of resistance to spinosad in M. domestica, which can be reverted by relaxing spinosad selection pressure and rotation with alternate insecticides.

The welding of dissimilar NPs in dispersion is mainly driven by the ligand desorptioninduced conformal contact between NPs and the diffusion of Au into chalcogenide NPs. The welding process can occur between NPs with distinct shapes or different capping agents or in different solvent media.

Radical surgery is the only potentially curative treatment option but most patients diagnosed with GBC are unresectable. Thus, there is a great need for the development of new treatment options including targeted therapy. Here, we aimed at identifying deregulated miRNAs and affected pathways involved in GBC development and progression. We performed global miRNA profiling of 40 GBC and 8 normal gallbladder tissues and identified large differences with 30% of miRNAs being differentially expressed (false discovery rate: FDR  0.001). We found 24 miRNAs to be differentially regulated in GBC with poor outcome (p  0.05) of which miR1455p was the most downregulated miRNA. Overexpression of miR1455p significantly reduced cell proliferation and colony formation. Gene expression analysis of cells expressing miR1455p mimics revealed activation of the Signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1) signaling pathway which is mainly tumor suppressive. Furthermore, the activation of STAT1 by miR1455p was specifically observed in gallbladder carcinoma and cholangiocarcinoma but not in hepatocellular carcinoma cells. The Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase Receptor Type F (PTPRF) is downregulated upon miR145 expression and may be involved in STAT1 regulation. In addition, we found that the STAT1regulated protein IRF7 is downregulated in GBC compared to normal gallbladder tissue and low IRF7 expression is associated with significantly lower overall survival of GBC patients. Thus, this study identified GBC patient subgroups and provides new mechanistic insights in the tumor suppressive function of miR1455p leading to activation of STAT1 signaling.", "authors": "Benjamin Goeppert; Felicia Truckenmueller; Alessandro Ori; Valerie Fritz; Thomas Albrecht; Angelika Fraas; Dominique Scherer; Rosa Gonzalez Silos; Carsten Sticht; Norbert Gretz; Arianeb Mehrabi; Melanie BewerungeHudler; Stefan Pusch; Justo Lorenzo Bermejo; Peter Dietrich; Peter Schirmacher; Marcus Renner; Stephanie Roessler", "keywords": "Cancer genetics; Hepatology", "organization_affiliated": "Institute of Pathology, University Hospital Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany; Institute of Pathology, University Hospital Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany; Leibniz Institute on Aging  Fritz Lipmann Institute (FLI), Jena, Germany; Institute of Biochemistry, EmilFischer Zentrum, FriedrichAlexanderUniversity ErlangenNurnberg, Erlangen, Germany; Institute of Pathology, University Hospital Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany; Institute of Pathology, University Hospital Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany; Institute of Medical Biometry and Informatics, University Hospital Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany; Institute of Medical Biometry and Informatics, University Hospital Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany; Center of Medical Research, University Hospital Mannheim, Mannheim, Germany; Center of Medical Research, University Hospital Mannheim, Mannheim, Germany; Department of General Visceral and Transplantation Surgery, University Hospital Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany; Genomics and Proteomics Core Facility, German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany; Heidelberg University Hospital, Institute of Pathology, Department of Neuropathology, Heidelberg, Germany and Clinical Cooperation Unit Neuropathology, German Cancer Research Center, Heidelberg, Germany; Institute of Medical Biometry and Informatics, University Hospital Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany; Institute of Biochemistry, EmilFischer Zentrum, FriedrichAlexanderUniversity ErlangenNurnberg, Erlangen, Germany; Department of Medicine, FriedrichAlexanderUniversity ErlangenNurnberg, Erlangen, Germany; Institute of Pathology, University Hospital Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany; Institute of Pathology, University Hospital Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany; Institute of Pathology, University Hospital Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany"}

This holds true in several vertebrate and also in certain freeliving invertebrate taxa. Here, we document the validity of RR in avian lice using three families (Philopteridae, Menoponidae, and Ricinidae). Using published data on the body length of 989 louse species, subspecies, or distinct intraspecific lineages, we applied phylogenetic reduced major axis regression to analyse the body size of females vs. males while accounting for phylogenetic nonindependence. Our results indicate that philopterid and menoponid lice follow RR, while ricinids exhibit the opposite pattern. In the case of philopterids and menoponids, we argue that largerbodied bird species tend to host lice that are both larger in size and more abundant. Thus, sexual selection acting on males makes them relatively larger, and this is stronger than fecundity selection acting on females. Ricinids exhibit converse RR, likely because fecundity selection is stronger in their case.", "authors": "Imre Sandor Piross; Andrea Harnos; Lajos Rozsa", "keywords": "Coevolution; Sexual selection", "organization_affiliated": "Department of Biomathematics and Informatics, University of Veterinary Medicine, Budapest, Hungary; Balaton Limnological Institute, MTA Centre for Ecological Research, Tihany, Hungary; Department of Biomathematics and Informatics, University of Veterinary Medicine, Budapest, Hungary; Evolutionary Systems Research Group, MTA Centre for Ecological Research, Tihany, Hungary; MTAELTEMTM Ecology Research Group, Budapest, Hungary"}

Although numerous studies have demonstrated that maternal syphilis increases the risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes and congenital syphilis, the subsequent growth pattern and morbidity of syphilisexposed uninfected infants are less understood. We conducted a longitudinal study to compare the growth pattern and disease distribution of syphilisexposed and syphilisunexposed uninfected children, and World Health Organization (WHO) reference standards from birth to 18 months of age. We obtained data from a prospective cohort study in three representative regions of Zhejiang Province in China. A total of 333 syphilisuninfected children born to women with syphilis were recruited at birth and matched with 333 syphilisuninfected children born to women without syphilis during pregnancy. Children were followedup by medical staff every 3 months until 18 months of age. The mixedeffects model was used to compare changes in growth patterns and influencing factors between the two groups. Mean weight, length, and head circumference of children, as well as disease prevalence, were similar between the groups. Multilevel analysis indicated that, after controlling confounders, growth velocities were comparable in both weight and length measures from birth to 18 months old between the two groups; however, low birth weight had a negative impact on weight gain in both groups. There was no significant negative association between syphilis exposure and early growth and health in children, under 18 months in a setting with universal coverage of therapeutic interventions for maternal syphilis. These findings may contribute to improving prevention efforts for mothertochild transmission of syphilis, such as early screening for syphilis in pregnant women, universal coverage of treatment, and interventions for exposed children.

In the presence of mutant KRAS DNA (mutDNA), the dumbbellshaped structure (DSS) is formed by the specific ligation of two substrates (SLS1 and SLS2), which act as a template to initiate the following LAMP amplification. Making use of the outstanding specificity of ligation reaction and superior amplification of LAMP, 10 aM mutDNA can be accurately determined. In addition, as low as 0.1% mutDNA can be detected in the presence of a large excess of wildtype KRAS DNA (wtDNA), indicating the high sensitivity and specificity of the method.

Hong Kong is a unique developed setting to study how household income and adolescent adiposity vary by migrant status given many Hong Kongborn Chinese children were born to parents who migrated from neighboring provinces of Mainland China. We examined differences between the associations of absolute household income vs. relative household income on adolescent body mass index (BMI) zscore or overweight (including obesity) status using a linear or logistic model in a Chinese birth cohort (n  5613, 68% followup). We focused on whether the associations differed by mother's or father's migrant status (birthplace). No association was found between absolute household income and BMI zscore among adolescents with either native or migrant mothers. However, the association of relative household income with BMI zscore varied by mother's migrant status (Pvalues for interaction 0.0005). In adolescents of native born mothers, greater relative household income deprivation was associated with higher BMI zscore (0.03 zscore per USD 128 difference in Yitzhaki index, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.01 to 0.05). However, in adolescents of migrant mothers, greater relative household income deprivation was associated with lower BMI zscore (0.05, 95% CI 0.09 to 0.01). Similar association of relative household income with overweight (including obesity) status was found in adolescents of native born mothers but not in adolescents of migrant mothers.

Histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors have been reported to attenuate renal fibrosis progression. Here, we investigated the effect of CG200745, a novel HDAC inhibitor, on renal fibrosis development in a mouse model of unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO). To examine the effects of CG200745 on renal fibrosis in UUO, C57BL6 J male mice were divided into three groups: control, UUO, and CG200745 (30 mgkgday)treated UUO groups. CG 200745 was administered through drinking water for 1 week. Human proximal tubular epithelial (HK2) cells were also treated with CG200745 (10 M) with or without TGF (2 ngmL). Seven days after UUO, plasma creatinine did not differ among the groups. However, plasma neutrophil gelatinaseassociated lipocalin (NGAL) levels were markedly increased in the UUO group, which were attenuated by CG200745 treatment. UUO kidneys developed marked fibrosis as indicated by collagen deposition and increased smooth muscle actin (SMA) and fibronectin expression. CG200745 treatment attenuated these fibrotic responses and suppressed UUOinduced production of transforming growth factorbeta1 (TGF) and phosphorylation of Smad23. CG200745 treatment also attenuated UUOinduced inflammation as indicated by the expression of inflammatory markers.

The present study furthers this knowledge by examining the phenotypic association between the orange mantle tissue morphotype and hard tissues: shells and cultured pearls. Based on a large experimental graft, shell colour quantification and pearl qualification showed that the orange morphotype is associated with lightcoloured shells and pearls. Expression analysis of some candidate genes previously identified in the white mantle mutant, tested here on both graft and pearl sac tissues from orange mantle donors, confirmed the involvement of genes associated with shell matrix protein (shem4) and the melanin biosynthesis pathway (zinc).

We showed for the first time that Raman imaging can be used to distinguish successfully between glycosylated and nonglycosylated proteins in normal and cancer tissue. Thousands of protein, lipid and glycan species exist in cells and tissues and their metabolism is monitored via numerous pathways, networks and methods. The metabolism can change in response to cellular environment alterations, such as development of a disease. Measuring such alterations and understanding the pathways involved are crucial to fully understand cellular metabolism in cancer development. In this paper Raman markers of glycogen, glycosaminoglycan, chondroitin sulfate, heparan sulfate proteoglycan were identified based on their vibrational signatures. High spatial resolution of Raman imaging combined with chemometrics allows separation of individual species from many chemical components present in each cell. We have found that metabolism of proteins, lipids and glycans is markedly deregulated in breast (adenocarcinoma) and brain (medulloblastoma) tumors.

The performance of these heterojunction devices depends crucially on the band alignments and their bending at the interfaces, which have been investigated for years according to Anderson's rule, SchottkyMott rule, Lindhard theory, quantum capacitance, and so on. Here, we demonstrate that by engineering two different acoustic waveguides with forbidden bands, one can achieve an acoustic heterojunction with an extraordinary transmission peak arising in the middle of the former gaps. We experimentally reveal that such a transmission is spatially dependent and disappears for a special junction structure. The junction proximity effect has been realized by manipulating the acoustic impedance ratios, which have been proven to be related to the geometrical (Zak) phases of the bulk bands.

For example, research suggests that damage to the DCML pathway may be associated with neuropathic pain after SCI. Tests for graphesthesia and directional cutaneous kinesthesia (DCK) are commonly used clinically to assess DCML function. However, the reliability and validity of these assessments in people with SCI have not been investigated. Moreover, there is a poor consistency between studies in the methodology of graphesthesia and DCK assessment.

The yellow mealworm, Tenebrio molitor L.

In this study, we investigated the effects of host age on C. cunea mass rearing by measuring parasitism, development and adult fertility of C. cunea on T. molitor pupae of different ages. The results showed no significant differences in the percentage of parasitized hosts and developmental time of C. cunea in pupae of different ages. However, the number of C. cunea adults (137.2154.7 adults per host) that emerged from 0, 1, and 2dayold pupae was significantly higher than that from 4dayold pupae. The lowest percentages of unemerged adults were found in 2dayold (1.2%) and 3dayold (1.4%) pupae, which were significantly lower than that of 4dayold pupae (10.3%). The emergence of adult females from 0 to 2dayold pupae (120.2142.3 per pupa) was significantly higher than that from 4dayold hosts (64.6). Adult females emerging from 2dayold pupae carried significantly more eggs (258.2 eggsfemale) than those from 0 and 1dayold pupae (178.4178.9 eggsfemale).

Identical premolar metal brackets were bonded on the buccal surfaces of the teeth. Both groups were submitted to a tension test using a universal testing machine. The number and length of the enamel microcracks in the buccal surface of each tooth were determined before bracket bonding and after debonding using a stereomicroscope. The percentage adhesive remnant index (PARI) was calculated after debonding. The results showed that the tensile bond strength (TBS) of brackets bonded to fluorosed teeth was 21.08% lower than that of brackets bonded to healthy teeth (p  0.0001).

Their primary mechanism of action is the modulation of neurotransmission and the consequent accumulation of monoamines, such as serotonin and noradrenaline. However, antidepressants have additional molecular targets that, through multiple signaling cascades, may ultimately alter essential cellular processes. In this regard, it was previously demonstrated that clomipramine, a widely used FDAapproved tricyclic antidepressant, interferes with the autophagic flux and severely compromises the viability of tumorigenic cells upon cytotoxic stress. Consistent with this line of evidence, we report here that clomipramine undermines autophagosome formation and cargo degradation in primary dissociated neurons. A similar pattern was observed in the frontal cortex and liver of treated mice, as well as in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans exposed to clomipramine.

The overall ATPase activity was highest at pH 7.5 in dcuABCD mutant. In wild type cells 50% of the activity came from the FOF1ATPase but in dcuD mutant it reached ~80%. K (100 mM) stimulate total but not DCCD inhibited ATPase activity 40% and 20% in wild type and dcuD mutant, respectively. 90% of overall ATPase activity was inhibited by DCCD at pH 5.5 only in dcuABC mutant. At pH 7.5 the H fluxes in E. coli wild type, dcuD and dcuABCD mutants was similar but in dcuABC triple mutant the H flux decreased 1.4 fold reaching 1.15 mMmin when glycerol was supplemented. In succinate assays the H flux was higher in the strains where DcuD is absent. No significant differences were determined in wild type and mutants specific growth rate except dcuD strain.

Dexamethasone is one of the most potent corticosteroids, and it has been reported to induce the side effect of impaired salivary gland function. This study aimed to evaluate the effects of dexamethasone on mouse submandibular gland function to gain insight into the mechanism of dexamethasoneinduced salivary hypofunction. The muscarinic agonist carbachol (CCh) induced salivary secretion and was not affected by shortterm dexamethasone treatment but was decreased following longterm dexamethasone administration. The expression levels of the membrane proteins NaK2Cl cotransporter, transmembrane member 16A, and aquaporin 5 were comparable between the control and longterm dexamethasone treatment groups. The CChinduced increase in calcium concentration was significantly lower in the presence of extracellular Ca2 in the longterm dexamethasone treatment group compared to that in the control group. Furthermore, CChinduced salivation in the absence of extracellular Ca2 and Ca2 ionophore A23187induced salivation was comparable between the control and longterm dexamethasone treatment groups. Moreover, salivation induced by the Ca2ATPase inhibitor thapsigargin was diminished in the longterm dexamethasone treatment group. In summary, these results demonstrate that shortterm dexamethasone treatment did not impair salivary gland function, whereas longterm dexamethasone treatment diminished storeoperated Ca2 entry, resulting in hyposalivation in mouse submandibular glands. Longterm corticosteroid use causes dry mouth by inhibiting calcium movement into salivary gland cells. Corticosteroid use is associated with multiple systemic side effects including salivary inhibition, prompting Yusuke Kondo and a research team from Japan's Kyushu Dental University to elucidate the reasons why. Submandibular glands taken from mice after six weeks' treatment with the corticosteroid dexamethasone produced significantly less saliva in ten minutes than a group given just one week's treatment, or no treatment at all. Further investigation revealed that longterm dexamethasone treatment inhibited the ability of salivary gland cells, known as acinar cells, to transport calcium ions from the exterior to the interior of the cellsan essential mechanism enabling salivation. The study improves our understanding of corticosteroidinduced dry mouth and reveals potential pharmacological targets to enable treatment.", "authors": "Yuichiro Kusuda; Yusuke Kondo; Yuta Miyagi; Takashi Munemasa; Yusuke Hori; Fumiko Aonuma; Shintaro Tsuka; Taro Mukaibo; Chihiro Masaki; Ryuji Hosokawa", "keywords": "Dentistry; Orthopedics; Surgical Orthopedics; Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery", "organization_affiliated": "Division of Oral Reconstruction and Rehabilitation, Kyushu Dental University, Kitakyushu, Japan; Division of Oral Reconstruction and Rehabilitation, Kyushu Dental University, Kitakyushu, Japan; Division of Oral Reconstruction and Rehabilitation, Kyushu Dental University, Kitakyushu, Japan; Division of Oral Reconstruction and Rehabilitation, Kyushu Dental University, Kitakyushu, Japan; Division of Oral Reconstruction and Rehabilitation, Kyushu Dental University, Kitakyushu, Japan; Division of Oral Reconstruction and Rehabilitation, Kyushu Dental University, Kitakyushu, Japan; Division of Oral Reconstruction and Rehabilitation, Kyushu Dental University, Kitakyushu, Japan; Division of Oral Reconstruction and Rehabilitation, Kyushu Dental University, Kitakyushu, Japan; Division of Oral Reconstruction and Rehabilitation, Kyushu Dental University, Kitakyushu, Japan; Division of Oral Reconstruction and Rehabilitation, Kyushu Dental University, Kitakyushu, Japan"}

The extended interaction klystron (EIK) has the great potential to generate hundreds of watt output power in terahertz band. The terahertz EIK adopts multiple gap cavities and unequalwidth slots structure is proposed with methodological improvement of bandwidth and output power. The unequalwidth slots are the key design of the multiple gap cavity, and the influences of unequalwidth slots on the electromagnetic field distribution and beamwave interaction are analyzed in detail. With multiple gap cavities and unequalwidth slots structure, EIK has advantages of wider frequency separation and larger effective characteristic impedance. Particle in cell (PIC) simulation indicates that the bandwidth of unequalwidth slots structure can reach to 550 MHz in our initial Gband EIK design. Then, we utilize two kinds of resonance cavities with different width ratios to build a sixcavity beamwave interaction system and make it operate at the state of staggertuning, the bandwidth can be extended to 11.5 GHz. Our research shows that the unequalwidth slots structure has wider tuning frequency range. Furthermore, the bandwidth can be further broadened to over 2 GHz when dynamictuning is adopted, while maintains a high output power of 560 W with efficiency of 11.3% and gain of 47.5 dB.

Here we report on the thermal stability of magnetic states of monovacancy graphene using ab initio molecular dynamics simulations. At room temperature, thermal fluctuations of the graphene lattice induce a rapid magnetic switching between two states with a high and low magnetic moment, indicating that due to the instability of the atomic structure of the vacancy, the associated magnetic moment is thermodynamically unstable. Lowering the temperature can significantly reduce the rate of the switching process and enhance the resident time on the high magnetic state. It stabilizes in the high magnetic state at as low as 30 K. Analyzing the atomic trajectories and the instant electronic structures confirms that these two magnetic states in MD simulations correspond to the magnetic and nonmagnetic states reported in the literatures. Such fluctuations of local magnetic moments are associated with the vertical displacement of the carbon atoms with the unsaturated dangling bond.

Tissues were harvested at E21 and fetuses fixed overnight in 4% paraformaldehydephosphate buffered saline. They were treated with 25% Lugol solution for 72 hours to ensure perfusion. Four different methods were used for fetal specimen preparation; isolated lung, upper torso, direct right ventricle contrast injection, and whole body with partial thoracic skin excision. The microCT scan was performed, and pulmonary vasculature was segmented. Vessels were analyzed for diameter, length, and branching. Of the four preparation methods, only whole body with partial thoracic skin excision resulted in adequate reconstruction of the pulmonary vasculature. In silico generated 3D images gathered by micro CT showed pulmonary vasculature distributed throughout the lung, which was representative of the shape and structure of the lungs. The mean number of vessels segmented in the pulmonary tree was 900  24 with a mean diameter of 134.13 m (range 40.72265.69 m). While up to the 30th generation of vessels could be segmented, both for arteries and veins, the majority of branching was between the 21st and 30th generations.

In this study, the neutron irradiation device designed by our institute was used to analyze the relationship between the seed components in different legume crops and their neutron absorption dose rate, fission gamma absorption dose rate, and induced gamma absorption dose rate. The results show that the effect sizes of the components on the neutron absorbed dose rate are as follows: ash  fat  moisture  carbohydrate  protein. The effect sizes of the components on the absorbed dose rate of fission gamma are as follows: ash  moisture  fat  carbohydrate  protein. There is a positive correlation between fission gamma absorbed dose rate and the weight of ash, water and fat, while a negative correlation with carbohydrate and protein. However, the linear relationship between each component and the absorbed dose rate of induced gamma is not significant, this needs to be identified by further researches. Based on the results of the present study, we conclude that the neutron absorbed dose can be calculated without taking into account the fat composition of bean crop seeds (except for soybean seeds) in the process of mutation breeding induced by radiation. In special cases where the accuracy requirement of the dose rate is not high, it is possible to use protein instead of legume crop seeds for neutron absorption dose calculations.", "authors": "Dapeng Xu; Yingguo Li; Ze'en Yao; Yongzhi Yin; Huyuan Feng; Zheng Wei", "keywords": "Agricultural genetics; Characterization and analytical techniques", "organization_affiliated": "School of Nuclear Science and Technology, Lanzhou University, Lanzhou, China; Engineering Research Center for Neutron Application Technology, Ministry of Education, Lanzhou University, Lanzhou, China; School of Nuclear Science and Technology, Lanzhou University, Lanzhou, China; Engineering Research Center for Neutron Application Technology, Ministry of Education, Lanzhou University, Lanzhou, China; School of Nuclear Science and Technology, Lanzhou University, Lanzhou, China; Engineering Research Center for Neutron Application Technology, Ministry of Education, Lanzhou University, Lanzhou, China; School of Nuclear Science and Technology, Lanzhou University, Lanzhou, China; Engineering Research Center for Neutron Application Technology, Ministry of Education, Lanzhou University, Lanzhou, China; School of Life Sciences, Lanzhou University, Lanzhou, China; School of Nuclear Science and Technology, Lanzhou University, Lanzhou, China; Engineering Research Center for Neutron Application Technology, Ministry of Education, Lanzhou University, Lanzhou, China"}

To what extent can the study of these responses substantiate the logic of their regulation? Here, we show how the input function of the genes constituting the response, i.e., the information of how their transcription rates change as function of the signals acting on the regulators, can serve as a quantitative tool to deconstruct the corresponding regulatory logic. To demonstrate this approach, we consider the multiple antibiotic resistance (mar) response in Escherichia coli. By characterizing the input function of its representative genes in wildtype and mutant bacteria, we recognize a dual autoregulation motif as main determinant of the response, which is further adjusted by the interplay with other regulators. We show that basic attributes, like its reaction to a wide range of stress or its moderate expression change, are associated with a strong negative autoregulation, while others, like the buffering of metabolic signals or the lack of memory to previous stress, are related to a weak positive autoregulation. With a mathematical model of the input functions, we identify some constraints fixing the molecular attributes of the regulators, and also notice the relevance of the bicystronic architecture harboring the dual autoregulation that is unique in E. coli. The input function emerges then as a tool to disentangle the rationale behind most of the attributes defining the mar phenotype. Overall, the present study supports the value of characterizing input functions to deconstruct the complexity of regulatory architectures in prokaryotic and eukaryotic systems. Many cellular responses result from the integration of numerous regulatory signals. To deconstruct the regulation of one of these responses, which enables resistance to multiple antibiotics in Escherichia coli, a team led by Juan F. Poyatos at the National Center for Biotechnology in Madrid studied the response input function by combining theoretical models and experiments. This function quantifies the rate of transcription of the genes constituting the response with respect to the signals acting on its cognate regulators. By examining how the shape of the function changes in different situations, e.g., when a given regulator is mutated, the team identified the implications for the specificity and dynamics of the response of a dual autoregulation at the core of the control architecture. The use of input functions as quantitative tools allows us to reverse engineer the complex regulations that dictate essential physiological functions in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells.", "authors": "Guillermo Rodrigo; Djordje Bajic; Ignacio Elola; Juan F.

Perturbations of the DISC1 functions lead to behavioral changes in animal models, which are relevant to psychiatric conditions in patients. In this work, we have expressed the human DISC1 gene in the fruit fly (Drosophila melanogaster) and performed a genetic screening for the mutations of psychiatric risk genes that cause modifications of DISC1 synaptic phenotypes at the neuromuscular junction. We found that DISC1 interacts with dnrx1, the Drosophila homolog of the human Neurexin (NRXN1) gene, in the development of glutamatergic synapses. While overexpression of DISC1 suppressed the total bouton area on the target muscles and stimulated active zone density in wildtype background, a partial reduction of the dnrx1 activity negated the DISC1mediated synaptic alterations. Likewise, overexpression of DISC1 stimulated the expression of a glutamate receptor component, DGLURIIA, in wildtype background but not in the dnrx1 heterozygous background. In addition, DISC1 caused mislocalization of Discs large, the Drosophila PSD95 homolog, in the dnrx1 heterozygous background. Analyses with a series of domain deletions have revealed the importance of axonal localization of the DISC1 protein for efficient suppression of DNRX1 in synaptic boutons. These results thus suggest an intriguing converging mechanism controlled by the interaction of DISC1 and Neurexin in the developing glutamatergic synapses. Fruit fly models uncover a potential new mechanism by which two schizophrenia risk factor genes interact to alter synaptic junctions. DISC1 gene alterations have previously been linked to psychiatric anomalies, although the gene has not been formally recognized as a schizophrenia risk factor. A USJapan research collaboration led by the University of Tsukuba's Katsuo FurukuboTokunaga expressed human DISC1 in fruit fly synapses to better understand the changes that take place when gene disruption leads to overexpression. The team found that overexpression of DISC1 affected the expression of the fruit fly counterpart to human 'neurexin,' a known risk factor for conditions including schizophrenia and autism spectrum disorders. The interaction between neurexin and DISC1 also influenced other synapsealtering genes. Further research is warranted to explore the roles of DISC1 and neurexin in psychiatric disease.", "authors": "Himani Pandey; Katia Bourahmoune; Takato Honda; Ken Honjo; Kazuki Kurita; Tomohito Sato; Akira Sawa; Katsuo FurukuboTokunaga", "keywords": "Genetics of the nervous system; Molecular neuroscience", "organization_affiliated": "Life and Environmental Sciences, University of Tsukuba, Tsukuba, Japan; Life and Environmental Sciences, University of Tsukuba, Tsukuba, Japan; Life and Environmental Sciences, University of Tsukuba, Tsukuba, Japan; Life and Environmental Sciences, University of Tsukuba, Tsukuba, Japan; Life and Environmental Sciences, University of Tsukuba, Tsukuba, Japan; Life and Environmental Sciences, University of Tsukuba, Tsukuba, Japan; Department of Psychiatry, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, USA; Life and Environmental Sciences, University of Tsukuba, Tsukuba, Japan"}

However, as a chemotherapeutic agent, gemcitabine can cause intolerably high levels of toxicity and patients often develop resistance to the beneficial effects of this drug. Combination studies show that use of gemcitabine with the proapoptotic cytokine TRAIL can enhance the inhibition of survival and induction of apoptosis of pancreatic cancer cells. Additionally, following combination treatment there is a dramatic increase in the level of the hypophosphorylated form of the tumour suppressor protein 4EBP1. This is associated with inhibition of mTOR activity, resulting from caspasemediated cleavage of the Raptor and Rictor components of mTOR. Use of the pancaspase inhibitor ZVADFMK indicates that the increase in level of 4EBP1 is also caspasemediated.

We find that current measurement and evaluative metrics hinge on the distribution of government resources and the number of vulnerable households assisted, rather than improving household wellbeing and reducing overall energy poverty. We suggest that comparisons to formal food insecurity and fuel poverty recognition and national responses in the US and UK, respectively, can help inform the development of more comprehensive US responses to energy poverty going forward.

In neurons, inactivation of both sodium and potassium channels is crucial for the generation of action potentials and regulation of firing frequency1,2. A cytoplasmic domain of either the channel or an accessory subunit is thought to plug the open pore to inactivate the channel via a 'ballandchain' mechanism37. Here we use cryoelectron microscopy to identify the molecular gating mechanism in calciumactivated potassium channels by obtaining structures of the MthK channel from Methanobacterium thermoautotrophicuma purely calciumgated and inactivating channelin a lipid environment. In the absence of Ca2, we obtained a single structure in a closed state, which was shown by atomistic simulations to be highly flexible in lipid bilayers at ambient temperature, with large rocking motions of the gating ring and bending of porelining helices. In Ca2bound conditions, we obtained several structures, including multiple openinactivated conformations, further indication of a highly dynamic protein. These different channel conformations are distinguished by rocking of the gating rings with respect to the transmembrane region, indicating symmetry breakage across the channel. Furthermore, in all conformations displaying open channel pores, the N terminus of one subunit of the channel tetramer sticks into the pore and plugs it, with free energy simulations showing that this is a strong interaction. Deletion of this N terminus leads to functionally noninactivating channels and structures of open states without a pore plug, indicating that this previously unresolved Nterminal peptide is responsible for a ballandchain inactivation mechanism. Cryoelectron microscopy structures and molecular dynamics simulations of the calciumactivated potassium channel MthK from Methanobacterium thermoautotrophicum are used to show that gating of this channel involves a ballandchain inactivation mechanism mediated by a previously unresolved Nterminal peptide.", "authors": "Chen Fan; Nattakan Sukomon; Emelie Flood; Jan Rheinberger; Toby W.

NF2associated VSs are often accompanied by meningioma (MN), and the majority of NF2 patients show loss of the NF2 tumor suppressor. mTORC1 and mTORC2specific serumglucocorticoidregulated kinase 1 (SGK1) are constitutively activated in MN with loss of NF2. In a recent highthroughput kinome screen in NF2null human arachnoidal and meningioma cells, we showed activation of EPH RTKs, cKIT, and SFK members independent of mTORC12 activation. Subsequently, we demonstrated in vitro and in vivo efficacy of combination therapy with the dual mTORC12 inhibitor AZD2014 and the multikinase inhibitor dasatinib. For these reasons, we investigated activated mTORC12 and EPH receptormediated signaling in sporadic and NF2associated VS. Using primary human VS cells and a mouse allograft model of schwannoma, we evaluated the dual mTORC12 inhibitor AZD2014 and the tyrosine kinase inhibitor dasatinib as monotherapies and in combination. Escalating doseresponse experiments on primary VS cells grown from 15 human tumors show that combination therapy with AZD2014 and dasatinib is more effective at reducing metabolic activity than either drug alone and exhibits a therapeutic effect at a physiologically reasonable concentration (~0.1 M). In vivo, while AZD2014 and dasatinib each inhibit tumor growth alone, the effect of combination therapy exceeds that of either drug.

Methods  Clinicians recorded their dental activity on a standard pro forma and records of the dentures were maintained by the DenTech volunteer laboratory technicians. Patient feedback was collected on standardised feedback forms at the dental reception and volunteer feedback was collected via an online survey. The team undertook a quality improvement evaluation using the PlanDoStudyAct methodology. Results  During the sevenday treatment period in 2017, 24 dentures were produced by the DenTech technicians, and in 2018, 31 dentures were created for people experiencing homelessness. In 2017, feedback was collected from 353 patients who attended the service: 99.4% were satisfied with their treatment and 98.3% would have recommended the service to others. Similarly, high levels of positive feedback were received in 2018. Of the dental volunteers who responded, 97.8% of volunteers felt that the denture service benefitted the patients. Conclusions  The DenTech denture service was wellreceived by patients and volunteers alike. For the first time at Crisis at Christmas, patients were able to have dental extractions and immediate replacement of these teeth without compromising their dignity and overall appearance. Learning outcomes  A quality improvement project utilising realtime volunteer and patient feedback can be a useful tool in reflecting upon the challenges and successes of a service as well as supporting its continual development.", "authors": "J.

Study selection  Four crosssectional studies and one casecontrol study were included where percentage levels of Herpes Simplex Virus Type 1 (HSV1), EpsteinBarr Virus (EBV) and Cytomegalovirus (CMV) were sampled for in both periimplantitis affected and healthy implant sites, with the latter used as the control. Studies were excluded that investigated any other infective agent, had fewer than ten participants, was performed in vitro or involved subjects with only periodontal disease. Data extraction and synthesis  Data extraction followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Metaanalysis (PRISMA) guideline process. Two examiners used the Newcastle Ottawa Scale to determine overall study quality while the key information was extracted and tabulated for comparison. The data was analysed using Chisquared test and I2 test for heterogenicity with a random effects or fixed affect models applied as appropriate. Risk difference of outcomes was displayed via a forest plot with 95% confidence intervals. Funnel plots were generated to evaluate publication bias. Results  All four crosssectional studies searched for EBV, while three also looked for CMV. The casecontrol study included investigated for HSV1 presence only. EBV presence in periimplantitis sites was found to be statistically significant in three of the four studies despite obvious heterogeneity. CMV presence at periimplantitis sites was statistically significant in all relevant studies, but the data displayed notable heterogeneity so as to render it insignificant. HSV1 exhibited similar percentage frequency in both healthy and diseased implant sites. Conclusions  Virus prevalence was found to be increased in patients with periimplantitis when compared to healthy sites but this assertion must be treated with caution as the data supporting it is weak due to the limited number of studies involved and the significant inherent heterogeneity they displayed.", "authors": "Timothy Brown; Lindsey Young; Thomas J.

The main sources of VP are the supraoptic and paraventricular (PVN) nuclei of the hypothalamus, which coexpress the vasopressin V1a and V1b receptors (V1aR and V1bR). Here, we investigated the level of expression of VP and VP receptors in the PVN of borderline hypertensive rats (BHRs), a key integrative nucleus for neuroendocrine cardiovascular control. Experiments were performed in male BHRs and Wistar rats (WRs) equipped with a radiotelemetry device for continuous hemodynamic recording under baseline conditions and after saline load without or with stress. Autonomic control of the circulation was evaluated by spectral analysis of blood pressure (BP) and heart rate (HR) variability and baroreceptor reflex sensitivity (BRS) using the sequence method. Plasma VP was determined by radioimmunoassay, and VP, V1aR, and V1bR gene expression was determined by RTqPCR. Under baseline conditions, BHRs had higher BP, lower HR, and stronger BRS than WRs. BP and HR variability was unchanged. In the PVN, overexpression of the VP and V1bR genes was found, and plasma VP was increased. Saline load downregulated V1bR mRNA expression without affecting VP mRNA expression or plasma VP and BP. Adding stress increased BP, HR, and lowfrequency sympathetic spectral markers and decreased plasma VP without altering the level of expression of VP and VP receptors in the PVN. It follows that overexpression of VP and V1bR in the PVN is a characteristic trait of BHRs and that sympathetic hyperactivity underlies stressinduced hypertension.", "authors": "Bojana Savic; Andrew Martin; Andre Souza Mecawi; Zoran Bukumiric; Jose AntunesRodrigues; David Murphy; Olivera Sarenac; Nina JapundzicZigon", "keywords": "MedicinePublic Health, general; Internal Medicine; Public Health; GeriatricsGerontology; ObstetricsPerinatologyMidwifery; Health Promotion and Disease Prevention", "organization_affiliated": "Faculty of Medicine, Institute of Pharmacology, Clinical Pharmacology and Toxicology, University of Belgrade, Belgrade, Serbia; Bristol Medical School: Translational Health Sciences, Dorothy Hodgkin Building, University of Bristol, Bristol, UK; Paulista Medical School, Department of Biophysics, Laboratory of Neuroendocrinology, Federal University of Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brazil; Faculty of Medicine, Institute for Medical Statics and Informatics, University of Belgrade, Belgrade, Serbia; Faculty of Medicine of Ribeirao Preto, Department of Physiology, University of Sao Paulo, Ribeirao Preto, Brazil; Bristol Medical School: Translational Health Sciences, Dorothy Hodgkin Building, University of Bristol, Bristol, UK; Faculty of Medicine, Institute of Pharmacology, Clinical Pharmacology and Toxicology, University of Belgrade, Belgrade, Serbia; Faculty of Medicine, Institute of Pharmacology, Clinical Pharmacology and Toxicology, University of Belgrade, Belgrade, Serbia"}

For unilateral aldosterone hypersecretion, the sensitivity and specificity of 2 h PAC were not inferior to those of 4 h PAC by Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods. The sensitivity and specificity of 2 h PAC for postoperative reduction of antihypertensive drugs were also not inferior to those of 4 h PAC. Although using the 2 h PAC  66 pgmL cutoff may increase false positives for PA diagnosis, the shortened SIT, possibly using a cutoff value higher than 66 pgmL, may be as useful as the standard SIT for selecting PA patients for AVS and to predict postoperative outcomes with reduced burden on patients.", "authors": "Kaoru Yamashita; Midori Yatabe; Yasufumi Seki; Kanako Bokuda; Daisuke Watanabe; Satoru Shimizu; Satoshi Morimoto; Atsuhiro Ichihara", "keywords": "MedicinePublic Health, general; Internal Medicine; Public Health; GeriatricsGerontology; ObstetricsPerinatologyMidwifery; Health Promotion and Disease Prevention", "organization_affiliated": "Department of Endocrinology and Hypertension, Tokyo Women's Medical University, Tokyo, Japan; Department of Endocrinology and Hypertension, Tokyo Women's Medical University, Tokyo, Japan; Department of Endocrinology and Hypertension, Tokyo Women's Medical University, Tokyo, Japan; Department of Endocrinology and Hypertension, Tokyo Women's Medical University, Tokyo, Japan; Department of Endocrinology and Hypertension, Tokyo Women's Medical University, Tokyo, Japan; Department of Medical Education, Tokyo Women's Medical University, Tokyo, Japan; Department of Endocrinology and Hypertension, Tokyo Women's Medical University, Tokyo, Japan; Department of Endocrinology and Hypertension, Tokyo Women's Medical University, Tokyo, Japan"}

One day after implantation, arterial pressure (AP) was directly recorded in conscious animals for 60 min. Square pulses (1 ms, 3 V, 30 Hz) were applied intermittently (2020 s ONOFF) to the CS for 48 h. After the end of stimulation, AP was recorded again. Nonstimulated rats (control group) and rats without electrodes around the CS (shamoperated) were also studied. Next, the animals were decapitated, and segments of mesenteric resistance arteries were removed to study vascular function. After the stimulation period, AP was 16  5 mmHg lower in the stimulated group, whereas shamoperated and control rats showed similar AP between the first and second recording periods. Heart rate variability (HRV) evaluated using time and frequency domain tools and a nonlinear approach (symbolic analysis) suggested that hypertensive rats with electrodes around the CS, stimulated or not, exhibited a shift in cardiac sympathovagal balance towards parasympathetic tone. The relaxation response to acetylcholine in endotheliumintact mesenteric arteries was enhanced in rats that underwent CS stimulation for 48 h. In conclusion, longterm CS stimulation is effective in reducing AP levels, improving HRV and increasing mesenteric vascular relaxation in lNAME hypertensive rats. Moreover, only the presence of electrodes around the CS is effective in eliciting changes in HRV similar to those observed in stimulated rats.", "authors": "Gean DomingosSouza; Fernanda Machado SantosAlmeida; Cesar Arruda Meschiari; Nathanne S.

As NADPH oxidases (NOXs) play major roles in the regulation of oxidative stress, we hypothesized that reduction of NOX activity by depletion of p22phox, an essential subunit of NOX complexes, would prevent cerebral stroke. To investigate this, we used the strokeprone spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHRSP) and the p22phoxdeleted congenic SHRSP. Although p22phox depletion reduced blood pressure under salt loading, it did not ameliorate oxidative stress or reduce the incidence of saltinduced stroke in SHRSPs. Additional pharmacological reduction of oxidative stress using antioxidant reagents with different mechanisms of action was necessary to prevent stroke, indicating that NOX was not the major target in saltinduced stroke in SHRSPs. On the other hand, oxidative stress measured based on urinary isoprostane levels showed significant correlations with blood pressure, stroke latency and urinary protein excretion under salt loading, suggesting an important role of oxidative stress per se in hypertension and hypertensive organ damage. Overall, our results imply that oxidative stress from multiple sources influences stroke susceptibility and other hypertensive disorders in saltloaded SHRSPs.", "authors": "Davis Ngarashi; Koichi Fujikawa; Mohammed Zubaerul Ferdaus; Hasan M.

One hundred and one samples were collected and divided into six groups: coronary artery lesion (KDCAL) before intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), KDCAL after IVIG, KD without CAL (KDnCAL) before IVIG, KDnCAL after IVIG, fever of unknown (Fou), and Healthy. In vitro OX40stimulating and OX40Linhibiting tests were conducted in Healthy and KD groups, respectively. Both the messenger RNA (mRNA) and protein expression levels of OX40, OX40L, NFAT1, and NFAT2 were investigated using quantitative reverse transcription PCR and immunoblotting assay, respectively. The mRNA and protein expression levels of NFAT1, NFAT2, OX40, and OX40L were significantly increased in KDCAL and KDnCAL groups before IVIG compared with Fou and Healthy groups and decreased after IVIG. A positive correlation was found between them in KD. In vitro OX40stimulating test demonstrated the significantly increased mRNA and protein expression levels of NFAT1 and NFAT2 in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells of the Healthy group. Meanwhile, OX40Linhibiting test showed significantly decreased expression levels of NFAT1 and NFAT2 in the KD group. OX40OX40L acts as an upstream regulator in the NFAT signaling pathway involved in KD.", "authors": "YuWen Lv; Ye Chen; HaiTao Lv; Xuan Li; YunJia Tang; WeiGuo Qian; QiuQin Xu; Ling Sun; GuangHui Qian; YueYue Ding", "keywords": "MedicinePublic Health, general; Pediatrics; Pediatric Surgery", "organization_affiliated": "Cardiology Department, Children's Hospital of Soochow University, Suzhou, China; Cardiology Department, Children's Hospital of Soochow University, Suzhou, China; Cardiology Department, Children's Hospital of Soochow University, Suzhou, China; Cardiology Department, Children's Hospital of Soochow University, Suzhou, China; Cardiology Department, Children's Hospital of Soochow University, Suzhou, China; Cardiology Department, Children's Hospital of Soochow University, Suzhou, China; Cardiology Department, Children's Hospital of Soochow University, Suzhou, China; Cardiology Department, Children's Hospital of Soochow University, Suzhou, China; Institute of Pediatric Research, Children's Hospital of Soochow University, Suzhou, China; Cardiology Department, Children's Hospital of Soochow University, Suzhou, China"}
