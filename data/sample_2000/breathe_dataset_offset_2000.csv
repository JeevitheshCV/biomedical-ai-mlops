f3df6a2c03784b618320049e4b9dc34a,Enhanced Corrosion Protection Performance by OrganicInorganic Materials Containing Thiocarbonyl Compounds,"In the present study, the synergistic effect on the corrosion protection properties of Mg alloys subjected to plasma electrolytic oxidation and chemically treated with thiourea as an inhibitor is investigated by surface microstructure analysis, evaluation of the electrochemical performance, and chemical quantum calculations. Physical adsorption of thiourea on the inorganic material surface might be due to physical interaction between thiourea with a low ionization potential serving as an electron donor and the inorganic components with high electron affinities acting as acceptors. The results from potentiodynamic polarization and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy for organicinorganic coating reveal a clear decrease in the corrosion rate owing to the introduced thiourea.",Wail Al Zoubi; Young Gun Ko,Composites; Corrosion,"Materials Electrochemistry Group, School of Materials Science and Engineering, Yeungnam University, Gyeongsan, Republic of Korea; Materials Electrochemistry Group, School of Materials Science and Engineering, Yeungnam University, Gyeongsan, Republic of Korea"

Results suggest that pinned dislocations can glide along the broad facets of extended 1 precipitates, a common strengthening phase in Mg rare earth (RE) alloys. A dislocationtheory based analysis suggests that the shape, spacing and orientation (with respect to the glide plane) of 1 precipitates may favor glide of pinned dislocations along interfaces as opposed to the classical mechanism of bowing and looping around the precipitate.",Zhihua Huang; John E.

e6df95cab9af4a68834acc4e816cfb4c,Tapered InP nanowire arrays for efficient broadband highspeed singlephoton detection,"Superconducting nanowire singlephoton detectors with peak efficiencies above 90% and unrivalled timing jitter (30 ps) have emerged as a potent technology for quantum information and sensing applications. However, their high cost and cryogenic operation limit their widespread applicability. Here, we present an approach using tapered InP nanowire pn junction arrays for highefficiency, broadband and highspeed photodetection without the need for cryogenic cooling. The truncated conical nanowire shape enables a broadband, linear photoresponse in the ultraviolet to nearinfrared range (~500 nm bandwidth) with external quantum efficiencies exceeding 85%. The devices exhibit a high gain beyond 105, such that a single photon per pulse can be distinguished from the dark noise, while simultaneously showing a fast pulse rise time (1 ns) and excellent timing jitter (20 ps). Such detectors open up new possibilities for applications in remote sensing, dose monitoring for cancer treatment, threedimensional imaging and quantum communication. Tapered InP nanowire pn junction arrays enable efficient broadband and highspeed roomtemperature photodetection.",Sandra J. Gibson; Brad van Kasteren; Burak Tekcan; Yingchao Cui; Dick van Dam; Jos E.

4e80e0a63398443392f6f39f058bba84,"Mapping global development potential for renewable energy, fossil fuels, mining and agriculture sectors","Mapping suitable land for development is essential to land use planning efforts that aim to model, anticipate, and manage tradeoffs between economic development and the environment. Previous land suitability assessments have generally focused on a few development sectors or lack consistent methodologies, thereby limiting our ability to plan for cumulative development pressures across geographic regions. Here, we generated 1km spatiallyexplicit global land suitability maps, referred to as ""development potential indices"" (DPIs), for 13 sectors related to renewable energy (concentrated solar power, photovoltaic solar, wind, hydropower), fossil fuels (coal, conventional and unconventional oil and gas), mining (metallic, nonmetallic), and agriculture (crop, biofuels expansion). To do so, we applied spatial multicriteria decision analysis techniques that accounted for both resource potential and development feasibility. For each DPI, we examined both uncertainty and sensitivity, and spatially validated the map using locations of planned development. We illustrate how these DPIs can be used to elucidate potential individual sector expansion and cumulative development patterns.

We describe the clinical validation, patient metrics, ordering patterns, results, reimbursement, and physician retrieval of results for the first consecutive 80 cases. Clinical GS was performed for both inpatients and outpatients undergoing etiologic evaluations. Results were reported in the electronic medical record. Evidence of report retrieval by clinicians and whether interpretation was concordant with laboratory report was obtained through retrospective chart review. Twenty definitive diagnoses were made in 19 patients (24%; n  80). Except for two partial gene deletions, all diagnostic variants would have been detectable by our exome methods. Surprisingly, there was no documentation of communication of results to the family in the medical record for 17.5% of patients, and in 7.5%, physician and laboratory interpretations were discordant. Average insurance reimbursement was 30.2%, with yield for commercial payers significantly higher, at 54.1%. The detection rate of GS is equivalent and potentially superior to exome sequencing (ES). Reimbursement rates were variable but overall satisfactory for commercial insurers, and poor for government entities. In addition, we identify opportunities for improvement in the communication of results to families, likely translatable to other tests and other institutions.",Isabelle Thiffault; Emily Farrow; Lee Zellmer; Courtney Berrios; Neil Miller; Margaret Gibson; Raymond Caylor; Janda Jenkins; Deb Faller; Sarah Soden; Carol Saunders,"Biomedicine, general; Human Genetics; Laboratory Medicine","Center for Pediatric Genomic Medicine Children's MercyKansas City, Kansas City, USA; School of Medicine, University of MissouriKansas City, Kansas City, USA; Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Children's MercyKansas City, Kansas City, USA; Center for Pediatric Genomic Medicine Children's MercyKansas City, Kansas City, USA; School of Medicine, University of MissouriKansas City, Kansas City, USA; Department of Pediatrics, Children's MercyKansas City, Kansas City, USA; Center for Pediatric Genomic Medicine Children's MercyKansas City, Kansas City, USA; Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Children's MercyKansas City, Kansas City, USA; Center for Pediatric Genomic Medicine Children's MercyKansas City, Kansas City, USA; School of Medicine, University of MissouriKansas City, Kansas City, USA; Center for Pediatric Genomic Medicine Children's MercyKansas City, Kansas City, USA; Center for Pediatric Genomic Medicine Children's MercyKansas City, Kansas City, USA; Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Children's MercyKansas City, Kansas City, USA; School of Medicine, University of MissouriKansas City, Kansas City, USA; Department of Pediatrics, Children's MercyKansas City, Kansas City, USA; Center for Pediatric Genomic Medicine Children's MercyKansas City, Kansas City, USA; Center for Pediatric Genomic Medicine Children's MercyKansas City, Kansas City, USA; School of Medicine, University of MissouriKansas City, Kansas City, USA; Department of Pediatrics, Children's MercyKansas City, Kansas City, USA; Center for Pediatric Genomic Medicine Children's MercyKansas City, Kansas City, USA; School of Medicine, University of MissouriKansas City, Kansas City, USA; Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Children's MercyKansas City, Kansas City, USA"

Using realtime AFM monitoring of cellular mechanical properties, spontaneous oscillations in cell stiffness and cell adhesion to the extracellular matrix (ECM) have been found. However, the lack of automated analytical approaches to systematically extract oscillatory signals, and noise filtering from a large set of AFM data, is a significant obstacle when quantifying and interpreting the dynamic characteristics of live cells. Here we demonstrate a method that extends the usage of AFM to quantitatively investigate live cell dynamics. Approaches such as singular spectrum analysis (SSA), and fast Fourier transform (FFT) were introduced to analyze a realtime recording of cell stiffness and the unbinding force between the ECM proteindecorated AFM probe and vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs). The time series cell adhesion and stiffness data were first filtered with SSA and the principal oscillatory components were isolated from the noise floor with the computed eigenvalue from the laggedcovariance matrix. Following the SSA, the oscillatory parameters were detected by FFT from the noisereduced time series data sets and the sinusoidal oscillatory components were constructed with the parameters obtained by FFT.",Hanna Sanyour; Josh Childs; Gerald A.

eeee5fb5aab24e8aabe873dcb25b1a4f,"Assisted reverse electrodialysisprinciples, mechanisms, and potential","Although seawater reverse osmosis (RO) is nearing its thermodynamic minimum energy limit, it is still an energyintensive process, requiring 23 kWhm3 at a recovery of 50%. Predesalination of the seawater by reverse electrodialysis (RED), using an impaired water source, can further decrease this energy demand by producing energy and reducing the seawater concentration. However, RED is hampered by the initial high resistance of the fresh water source, resulting in a high required membrane area (i.e., high investment costs). In this paper, a new process is presented that can overcome this initial resistance and decrease the RED investment cost without the need for additional infrastructure: assisted RED (ARED). In ARED, a small potential difference is applied in the direction of the natural salinity gradient, increasing the ionic transport rate and rapidly decreasing the initial diluate resistance. This decreasing resistance is shown to outweigh any negative effects caused by, for example, concentration polarization, resulting in a process that is more efficient than theoretically expected. As this effect is mainly important at low diluate concentrations (up to 0.1 M), ARED is proposed as a first step in an economic and energy efficient (A)REDRO hybrid process. Coupling reverse osmosis with assisted reverse electrodialysis can reduce the cost of seawater desalination. While reverse osmosis currently accounts for more than 60% of our worldwide seawater desalination capacity, this crucial process operates at a high energy demand. A reverse electrodialysis (RED) pretreatment of seawater, diluted with a waste water stream, reduces the energy demand by producing energy and by reducing the concentration of the seawater subjected to reverse osmosis. Nonetheless, low transport rates in RED require highmembrane surface areas, making the costs impractical. A team led by Marjolein Vanoppen at Gent University in Belgium design an assisted RED pretreatment process, where a small potential difference is applied in the direction of the salinity gradient, increasing the ionic transport rate and decreasing the required membrane surface area, thus offering a more economically viable alternative.",Marjolein Vanoppen; Ella Criel; Griet Walpot; David A.

08558566fe7649be99704c2445bc5aeb,Impact of tensile strain on low Sn content GeSn lasing,"In recent years much effort has been made to increase the Sn content in GeSn alloys in order to increase direct bandgap charge carrier recombination and, therefore, to reach room temperature lasing. While being successful for the former, the increase of Sn content is detrimental, leading to increased defect concentrations and a lower thermal budget regarding processing. In this work we demonstrate strong photoluminescence enhancement in low Sn content Ge0.94Sn0.06 layers by implementing tensile strain. Fitting of the calculated photoluminescence spectra to reproduce our experimental results indicates a strain of ~1.45%, induced via an SiNx stressor layer, which is strong enough to transform the investigated layer into a direct bandgap semiconductor. Moreover, theoretical calculations, using the 8band kp model, show the advantages of using low Sn content tensile strained GeSn layers in respect to gain and lasing temperature. We show that low Sn content GeSn alloys have a strong potential to enable efficient room temperature lasers on electronicphotonic integrated circuits.",Denis Rainko; Zoran Ikonic; Anas Elbaz; Nils von den Driesch; Daniela Stange; Etienne Herth; Philippe Boucaud; Moustafa El Kurdi; Detlev Grutzmacher; Dan Buca,Electronic structure; Photonic devices; Semiconductor lasers; Semiconductors,"Peter Grunberg Institute (PGI 9) and JARAFundamentals of Future Information Technologies, Forschungszentrum Juelich, Juelich, Germany; Pollard Institute, School of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University of Leeds, Leeds, UK; Center for Nanoscience and Nanotechnologies, C2N UMR 9001 CNRSUniversite ParisSud, Universite ParisSaclay, Orsay, France; Peter Grunberg Institute (PGI 9) and JARAFundamentals of Future Information Technologies, Forschungszentrum Juelich, Juelich, Germany; Peter Grunberg Institute (PGI 9) and JARAFundamentals of Future Information Technologies, Forschungszentrum Juelich, Juelich, Germany; Center for Nanoscience and Nanotechnologies, C2N UMR 9001 CNRSUniversite ParisSud, Universite ParisSaclay, Orsay, France; Center for Nanoscience and Nanotechnologies, C2N UMR 9001 CNRSUniversite ParisSud, Universite ParisSaclay, Orsay, France; Center for Nanoscience and Nanotechnologies, C2N UMR 9001 CNRSUniversite ParisSud, Universite ParisSaclay, Orsay, France; Peter Grunberg Institute (PGI 9) and JARAFundamentals of Future Information Technologies, Forschungszentrum Juelich, Juelich, Germany; Peter Grunberg Institute (PGI 9) and JARAFundamentals of Future Information Technologies, Forschungszentrum Juelich, Juelich, Germany"

Previous studies demonstrate barrierprotective and antiinflammatory effects of bioactive lipid prostacyclin and its stable analog iloprost (ILO). We generated a phospholipase resistant synthetic phospholipid with iloprost attached at the sn2 position (ILOPC) and investigated its biological effects. In comparison to free ILO, ILOPC caused sustained endothelial cell (EC) barrier enhancement, linked to more prolonged activation of Rap1 and Rac1 GTPases and their cytoskeletal and cell junction effectors: cortactin, PAK1, p120catenin and VEcadherin. ILO and ILOPC equally efficiently suppressed acute, Rho GTPasedependent EC hyperpermeability caused by thrombin. However, ILOPC exhibited more sustained barrierprotective and antiinflammatory effects in the model of chronic EC dysfunction caused by bacterial wall lipopolysacharide (LPS). ILOPC was also more potent inhibitor of NFB signaling and lung vascular leak in the murine model of LPSinduced ALI. Treatment with ILOPC showed more efficient ALI recovery over 3 days after LPS challenge than free ILO. In conclusion, this study describes a novel synthetic phospholipid with barrierenhancing and antiinflammatory properties superior to existing prostacyclin analogs, which may be used as a prototype for future development of more efficient treatment for ALI and other vascular leak syndromes.",Olga Oskolkova; Nicolene Sarich; Yufeng Tian; Grzegorz Gawlak; Fanyong Meng; Valery N.

RNA within single cells can be analyzed using unbiased sequencing protocols or through more targeted approaches using in situ hybridization (ISH). The proximity ligation assay for RNA (PLAYR) approach is a sensitive and highthroughput technique that relies on in situ and proximal ligation to measure at least 27 specific RNAs by flow or mass cytometry. We provide detailed instructions for combining this technique with antibodybased detection of surfaceinternal protein, allowing simultaneous highly multiplexed profiling of RNA and protein expression at singlecell resolution. PLAYR overcomes limitations on multiplexing seen in previous branching DNAbased RNA detection techniques by integration of a transcriptspecific oligonucleotide sequence within a rollingcircle amplification (RCA). This unique transcriptassociated sequence can then be detected by heavy metal (for mass cytometry) or fluorophore (for flow cytometry)conjugated complementary detection oligonucleotides. Included in this protocol is methodology to label oligonucleotides with lanthanide metals for use in mass cytometry. When analyzed by mass cytometry, up to 40 variables (with scope for future expansion) can be measured simultaneously. We used the described protocol to demonstrate intraclonal heterogeneity within primary cells from chronic lymphocytic leukemia patients, but it can be adapted to other primary cells or cell lines in suspension. This robust, reliable and reproducible protocol can be completed in 23 d and can be paused at several stages for convenience. This protocol describes the proximity ligation assay for RNA (PLAYR). PLAYR can be used to simultaneously detect at least 27 RNA transcripts using flow or mass cytometry and can be combined with protein detection via conventional antibody staining.",Andrew D.

2a3eae4d2ef54f01a42451874528cb57,Accounting for black carbon lowers estimates of blue carbon storage services,"The canopies and roots of seagrass, mangrove, and saltmarsh protect a legacy of buried sedimentary organic carbon from resuspension and remineralisation. This legacy's value, in terms of mitigating anthropogenic emissions of CO2, is based on total organic carbon (TOC) inventories to a depth likely to be disturbed. However, failure to subtract allochthonous recalcitrant carbon overvalues the storage service. Simply put, burial of oxidationresistant organics formed outside of the ecosystem provides no additional protection from remineralisation. Here, we assess whether black carbon (BC), an allochthonous and recalcitrant form of organic carbon, is contributing to a significant overestimation of blue carbon stocks. To test this supposition, BC and TOC contents were measured in different types of seagrass and mangrove sediment cores across tropical and temperate regimes, with different histories of air pollution and fire together with a reanalysis of published data from a subtropical system. The results suggest current carbon stock estimates are positively biased, particularly for loworganiccontent sandy seagrass environs, by 18  3% (95% confidence interval) and 43  21% (95% CI) for the temperate and tropical regions respectively. The higher BC fractions appear to originate from atmospheric deposition and substantially enrich the relatively low TOC fraction within these environs.",Swee Theng Chew; John B.

c4758363abf941f6926cc41a5f81d0af,Molecular Mechanism of Resveratrol's Lipid Membrane Protection,"Resveratrol, a natural compound found in red wine and various vegetables, has drawn increasing interest due to its reported benefit in cardiovascular protection, neurodegenerative disorders, and cancer therapy. The mechanism by which resveratrol exerts such pleiotropic effects remains unclear. It remains as one of the most discussed polyphenol compounds in the debating ""French Paradox"". In this study, using molecular dynamics simulations of dipalmitoyl phosphatidylcholine (DPPC) bilayer with resveratrol, we generated a free energy map of resveratrol's location and orientation of inside the lipid bilayer. We found that resveratrol increases the surface area per lipid and decreases membrane thickness, which is the opposite effect of the wellstudied cholesterol on liquid phase DPPC. Most importantly, based on the simulation observation that resveratrol has a high probability of forming hydrogen bonds with sn1 and sn2 ester groups, we discovered a new mechanism using experimental approach, in which resveratrol protects both sn1 and sn2 ester bonds of DPPC and distearoyl phosphatidylcholine (DSPC) from phospholipase A1 (PLA1) and phospholipase A2 (PLA2) cleavage. Our study elucidates the new molecular mechanism of potential health benefits of resveratrol and possibly other similar polyphenols and provides a new paradigm for drug design based on resveratrol and its analogs.",Qinqin Fei; David Kent; Wesley M.

7fbda222d6404b71bd9cb8013ddd40c1,Unveiling coherently driven hyperpolarization dynamics in signal amplification by reversible exchange,"Signal amplification by reversible exchange (SABRE) is an efficient method to hyperpolarize spin12 nuclei and affords signals that are orders of magnitude larger than those obtained by thermal spin polarization. Direct polarization transfer to heteronuclei such as 13C or 15N has been optimized at static microTesla fields or using coherence transfer at high field, and relies on steady state exchange with the polarization transfer catalyst dictated by chemical kinetics. Here we demonstrate that pulsing the excitation field induces complex coherent polarization transfer dynamics, but in fact pulsing with a roughly 1% duty cycle on resonance produces more magnetization than constantly being on resonance. We develop a Monte Carlo simulation approach to unravel the coherent polarization dynamics, show that existing SABRE approaches are quite inefficient in use of parahydrogen order, and present improved sequences for efficient hyperpolarization. There is increasing effort to improve the signal sensitivity and explore the hyperpolarization dynamics. Here the authors demonstrate the parahydrogen spin transfer dynamics in compounds containing 15N using SABRE hyperpolarization technique with different strengths of the magnetic field.",Jacob R.

We investigated the photoluminescence property of carbon dots (CDs) in the presence of Fe3O4capped Au (Fe3O4Au). Firstly, we designed two dedicated probes for unique long sequence region of human Tlymphotropic virus type 1 genome. One of the probes was covalently bound to the CDs. In the absence of target, CDsprobe was adsorbed on the surface of Fe3O4Au through two possible mechanisms, leading to quenching the fluorescence emission of CDs. The fluorescence emission of CDs was recovered in the presence of target since doublestranded DNA cannot adsorb on the Fe3O4Au. Also, Fe3O4Au can adsorb the unhybridized oligonucleotides and improves the accuracy of detection. The specificity of the proposed biosensor was confirmed by BLAST search and assessed by exposing the biosensor to other virus targets.

Patients featuring MET amplification, a genetic lesion driving transformation, may benefit from antiMET treatment. We explored if METtargeted therapy interferes with Interferon modulation of PDL1PDL2 in METamplified tumours. PDL1PDL2 expression and signalling pathways downstream of MET or Interferon were analysed in METamplified tumour cell lines and in patientderived tumour organoids, in basal condition, upon Interferon stimulation, and after antiMET therapy. PDL1 and PDL2 were upregulated in METamplified tumour cells upon Interferon treatment. This induction was impaired by JNJ605, a selective inhibitor of MET kinase activity, and MvDN30, an antibody inducing MET proteolytic cleavage. We found that activation of JAKs STAT1, signal transducers downstream of the Interferon receptor, was neutralised by MET inhibitors. Moreover, JAK2 and MET associated in the same signalling complex depending on MET phosphorylation. Results were confirmed in METamplified organoids derived from human colorectal tumours, where JNJ605 treatment revoked Interferon induced PDL1 expression. These data show that in METamplified cancers, treatment with MET inhibitors counteracts the induction of PD1 ligands by Interferon. Thus, therapeutic use of antiMET drugs may provide additional clinical benefit over and above the intended inhibition of the target oncogene.",Valentina Martin; Cristina Chiriaco; Chiara Modica; Anna Acquadro; Marco Cortese; Francesco Galimi; Timothy Perera; Loretta Gammaitoni; Massimo Aglietta; Paolo M.

1ffb61e3c0114979bc574e35fe9012db,Slippage of degenerate primers can cause variation in amplicon length,"It is well understood that homopolymer regions should be avoided for primer binding to prevent offtarget amplification. However, in metabarcoding, it is often difficult to avoid primer degeneracy in order to maximize taxa detection. We here investigate primer binding specificity using different primer sets from several invertebrate metabarcoding studies. Our results indicate that primers frequently bound 12 bp upstream in taxa where a homopolymer region was present in the amplification direction. Primer binding 1 bp downstream was observed less frequently. This primer slippage leads to taxonspecific length variation in amplicons and subsequent length variation in recovered sequences. Some widely used primer sets were severely affected by this bias, while others were not. While this variation will only have small impacts on the designation of Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs) by clustering algorithms that ignore terminal gaps, primer sets employed in metabarcoding projects should be evaluated for their sensitivity to slippage. Moreover, steps should be taken to reduce slippage by improving protocols for primer design. For example, the flanking region adjacent to the 3 end of the primer is not considered by current primer development software although GC clamps in this position could mitigate slippage.",Vasco Elbrecht; Paul D.

00bb5b3c266c4ef7a917a1ce7842b236,Clinical Utility of FDG PETCT in Patients with Autoimmune Pancreatitis: a CaseControl Study,"Autoimmune pancreatitis (AIP) shares overlapping clinical features with pancreatic cancer (PC). Importantly, treatment of the two conditions is different. We investigated the clinical usefulness of 18Ffluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomographycomputed tomography (PETCT) in patients with suspected AIP before treatment. From September 2008 to July 2016, 53 patients with suspected AIP at National Taiwan University Hospital had PETCT prior to therapy to exclude malignancy and evaluate the extent of inflammation. Their scans were compared with those from 61 PC patients. PET imaging features were analyzed using logistic regression. Significant differences in pancreatic tumor uptake morphology, maximum standardized uptake value, highorder primary tumor texture feature (i.e. highgray level zone emphasis value), and numbers and location of extrapancreatic foci were found between AIP and PC. Using the prediction model, the area under curve of receiveroperator curve was 0.95 (P  0.0001) with sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive, and negative predictive values of 90.6%, 84.0%, 87.9%, and 87.5% respectively, in differentiating AIP from PC. FDG PETCT offers high sensitivity, albeit slightly lower specificity in differentiating AIP from PC. Nonetheless, additional systemic inflammatory foci detected by the whole body PETCT help confirm diagnosis of AIP in these patients before initiating steroid therapy, especially when biopsy is inconclusive.",MeiFang Cheng; Yue Leon Guo; RuohFang Yen; YiChieh Chen; ChiLun Ko; YuWen Tien; WeiChih Liao; ChiaJu Liu; YenWen Wu; HsiuPo Wang,Autoimmunity; Cancer imaging,"Department of Nuclear Medicine, National Taiwan University College of Medicine and Hospital, Taipei City, Taiwan; Institute of Occupational Medicine and Industrial Hygiene, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan; Institute of Occupational Medicine and Industrial Hygiene, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan; Environmental and Occupational Medicine, National Taiwan University College of Medicine and Hospital, Taipei City, Taiwan; Department of Nuclear Medicine, National Taiwan University College of Medicine and Hospital, Taipei City, Taiwan; Department of Nuclear Medicine, National Taiwan University College of Medicine and Hospital, Taipei City, Taiwan; Department of Nuclear Medicine, National Taiwan University College of Medicine and Hospital, Taipei City, Taiwan; Department of Surgery, National Taiwan University College of Medicine and Hospital, Taipei City, Taiwan; Department of Internal Medicine, National Taiwan University College of Medicine and Hospital, Taipei City, Taiwan; Department of Nuclear Medicine, National Taiwan University Hospital, YunLin Branch, YunLin County, Taiwan; Department of Nuclear Medicine, National Taiwan University College of Medicine and Hospital, Taipei City, Taiwan; Department of Nuclear Medicine and Cardiovascular Medical Center (Cardiology), Far Eastern Memorial Hospital, New Taipei City, Taiwan; National YangMing University School of Medicine, Taipei, Taiwan; Department of Internal Medicine, National Taiwan University College of Medicine and Hospital, Taipei City, Taiwan"

Compared to conventional PtC electrodes under the same conditions, the proposed nanocatalyst shows closer onset potential and current density. Typically, the observed onset potentials and current densities for the synthesized and PtC electrodes are 825 and 910 mV (vs. NHE) and 3.65 and 4.31 mA.cm2 (at 5 mV.s1), respectively. However, the most important advantage of the introduced metallic alloydecorated graphene is its distinct stability in acid medium; the retention in the electrocatalytic performance after 1,000 successive cycles is approximately 98%. This finding is attributed to the high corrosion resistance of the NiFe alloy. The kinetic study indicates that the number of the transferred electrons is 3.46 and 3.89 for the introduced and PtC (20 wt%) electrodes, respectively which concludes a high activity for the proposed nanocomposite. The suggested decorated graphene can be synthesized using a multithermal method. Typically, nickel acetate, iron acetate, graphene oxide and urea are subjected to MW heating. Then, sintering with melamine in an Argon atmosphere at 750 C is required to produce the final electrocatalyst. Overall, the introduced NiFe Ndoped Gr nanocomposite shows remarkable electrochemical activity in the acid medium with longterm stability.",Nasser A. M. Barakat; Ahmed G.

We evaluated the usefulness of combined markers of PDL1 and MSI or CD8 TILs as a prognostic biomarker in gastric cancer. A total of 283 patients with gastric cancer were reviewed retrospectively. PDL1 expression on 5% tumor cells was defined as PDL1positive. PDL1positive rate was 15.5% (44283). PDL1 positivity was significantly correlated with invasive and advanced cancer and also significantly correlated with MSI, whereas no significance was observed with CD8 TILs. KaplanMeier analysis showed that PDL1 positivity significantly correlated with a poor prognosis (p  0.0025). Multivariate analysis revealed that PDL1 positivity was an independent poor prognostic factor (hazard ratio HR]: 1.97, p  0.0106) along with diffuse histological type and lymph node metastases. Combinations of PDL1 and MSI (HR: 2.18) or CD8 TILs (HR: 2.57) were stronger predictive factors for prognosis than PDL1 alone. In conclusion, combined markers of PDL1 and MSI or CD8 TILs may be more useful prognostic biomarkers in gastric cancer, and better clarify the immune status of gastric cancer patients.",Toshiaki Morihiro; Shinji Kuroda; Nobuhiko Kanaya; Yoshihiko Kakiuchi; Tetsushi Kubota; Katsuyuki Aoyama; Takehiro Tanaka; Satoru Kikuchi; Takeshi Nagasaka; Masahiko Nishizaki; Shunsuke Kagawa; Hiroshi Tazawa; Toshiyoshi Fujiwara,Gastric cancer; Tumour immunology,"Department of Gastroenterological Surgery, Okayama University Graduate School of Medicine, Dentistry and Pharmaceutical Sciences, Okayama, Japan; Department of Gastroenterological Surgery, Okayama University Graduate School of Medicine, Dentistry and Pharmaceutical Sciences, Okayama, Japan; Center for Innovative Clinical Medicine, Okayama University Hospital, Okayama, Japan; Department of Gastroenterological Surgery, Okayama University Graduate School of Medicine, Dentistry and Pharmaceutical Sciences, Okayama, Japan; Department of Gastroenterological Surgery, Okayama University Graduate School of Medicine, Dentistry and Pharmaceutical Sciences, Okayama, Japan; Department of Gastroenterological Surgery, Okayama University Graduate School of Medicine, Dentistry and Pharmaceutical Sciences, Okayama, Japan; Department of Gastroenterological Surgery, Okayama University Graduate School of Medicine, Dentistry and Pharmaceutical Sciences, Okayama, Japan; Department of Pathology, Okayama University, Okayama, Japan; Department of Gastroenterological Surgery, Okayama University Graduate School of Medicine, Dentistry and Pharmaceutical Sciences, Okayama, Japan; Minimally Invasive Therapy Center, Okayama University Hospital, Okayama, Japan; Department of Clinical Oncology, Kawasaki Medical School, Kurashiki, Japan; Department of Gastroenterological Surgery, Okayama University Graduate School of Medicine, Dentistry and Pharmaceutical Sciences, Okayama, Japan; Department of Gastroenterological Surgery, Okayama University Graduate School of Medicine, Dentistry and Pharmaceutical Sciences, Okayama, Japan; Minimally Invasive Therapy Center, Okayama University Hospital, Okayama, Japan; Department of Gastroenterological Surgery, Okayama University Graduate School of Medicine, Dentistry and Pharmaceutical Sciences, Okayama, Japan; Center for Innovative Clinical Medicine, Okayama University Hospital, Okayama, Japan; Department of Gastroenterological Surgery, Okayama University Graduate School of Medicine, Dentistry and Pharmaceutical Sciences, Okayama, Japan"
6a4a363a26504cd585487c4823f274ed,Inorganic carbon and nitrogen assimilation in cellular compartments of a benthic kleptoplastic foraminifer,"Haynesina germanica, an ubiquitous benthic foraminifer in intertidal mudflats, has the remarkable ability to isolate, sequester, and use chloroplasts from microalgae. The photosynthetic functionality of these kleptoplasts has been demonstrated by measuring photosystem II quantum efficiency and O2 production rates, but the precise role of the kleptoplasts in foraminiferal metabolism is poorly understood. Thus, the mechanism and dynamics of C and N assimilation and translocation from the kleptoplasts to the foraminiferal host requires study. The objective of this study was to investigate, using correlated TEM and NanoSIMS imaging, the assimilation of inorganic C and N (here ammonium, NH4) in individuals of a kleptoplastic benthic foraminiferal species. H. germanica specimens were incubated for 20 h in artificial seawater enriched with H13CO3 and 15NH4 during a lightdark cycle. All specimens (n  12) incorporated 13C into their endoplasm stored primarily in the form of lipid droplets. A control incubation in darkness resulted in no 13Cuptake, strongly suggesting that photosynthesis is the process dominating inorganic C assimilation. Ammonium assimilation was observed both with and without light, with diffuse 15Nenrichment throughout the cytoplasm and distinct 15Nhotspots in fibrillar vesicles, electronopaque bodies, tubulin paracrystals, bacterial associates, and, rarely and at moderate levels, in kleptoplasts. The latter observation might indicate that the kleptoplasts are involved in N assimilation. However, the higher N assimilation observed in the foraminiferal endoplasm incubated without light suggests that another cytoplasmic pathway is dominant, at least in darkness. This study clearly shows the advantage provided by the kleptoplasts as an additional source of carbon and provides observations of ammonium uptake by the foraminiferal cell.",Charlotte LeKieffre; Thierry Jauffrais; Emmanuelle Geslin; Bruno Jesus; Joan M.

Here, we report that compound genetic interactions between DNA sequence variants contribute to the complex heritability of DCM. By using genetic data from a large family with a history of DCM, we discovered that heterozygous sequence variants in the TROPOMYOSIN 1 (TPM1) and VINCULIN (VCL) genes cosegregate in individuals affected by DCM. In vitro studies of patientderived and isogenic humanpluripotentstemcellderived cardiomyocytes that were genomeedited via CRISPR to create an allelic series of TPM1 and VCL variants revealed that cardiomyocytes with both TPM1 and VCL variants display reduced contractility and sarcomeres that are less organized. Analyses of mice genetically engineered to harbour these human TPM1 and VCL variants show that stress on the heart may also influence the variable penetrance and expressivity of DCMassociated genetic variants in vivo. We conclude that compound genetic variants can interact combinatorially to induce DCM, particularly when influenced by other diseaseprovoking stressors. Genomeedited human pluripotent stem cells and genomeedited mouse models reveal that combinatorial genetic interactions contribute to the complex genetic heritability of human cardiomyopathy.",Dekker C.

To compare the incidence of adverse drug events (ADEs) between persons with and without spinal cord injury (SCI), while controlling for all potential and available risk factors. A commercially available claims dataset consisting of ~170 million patient cases in the United States between 2012 and 2013. Participants (aged 1864 years) included 2779 persons with polypharmacy and traumatic or nontraumatic SCI and 2779 propensity scorematched persons with polypharmacy without SCI. The cohorts were matched using demographic variables including number of concomitant prescriptions, comorbidities, hospital admissions, age, gender, and geographic region. Inpatient and outpatient claims records containing 395 distinct IDC9 codes indicative of ADEs were extracted. Incidence and frequency of ADEs were compared between groups using logistic and Poisson regression, respectively. Persons with SCI were significantly more likely to experience an ADE than matched controls (Odds Ratio  1.45, p  0.0001). Among persons with ADEs (n  1552), individuals with SCI experienced fewer ADEs over time than matched controls (Incidence Rate Ratio  0.91, p  0.0001). While persons with SCI and polypharmacy are at a greater risk for experiencing an ADE, their medical care after an ADE may be better managed than that of a matched control population. There may be a need for practice guidelines that facilitate proactive identification of persons with SCI at the highest risk of ADE. Steps may then be taken to mitigate risk, in contrast to current practice trends that appear to take a reactive approach after an ADE has occurred.",Brittany N. Hand; James S. Krause; Kit N.

Our aim was to develop a foodbased diet score based on international literature and examine its discriminative capacity and sociodemographic determinants. Between 2006 and 2013, dietary intake of 129,369 participants of the Lifelines Cohort (42% male, 45  13 years (range 1893)) was assessed with a 110item food frequency questionnaire. Based on the 2015 Dutch Dietary Guidelines and underlying literature, nine food groups with positive (vegetables, fruit, whole grain products, legumesnuts, fish, oilssoft margarines, unsweetened dairy, coffee and tea) and three food groups with negative health effects (redprocessed meat, butterhard margarines and sugarsweetened beverages) were identified. Per food group, the intake in grams per 1000 kcal was categorized into quintiles, awarded 0 to 4 points (negative groups scored inversely) and summed. Food groups with neutral, unknown or inconclusive evidence are described but not included. The Lifelines Diet Score (LLDS) discriminated well between high and low consumers of included food groups. This is illustrated by e.g. a 2fold higher vegetable intake in the highest, compared to the lowest LLDS quintile. Differences were 5.5fold for fruit, 3.5fold for fish, 3fold for dairy and 8fold for sugarsweetened beverages. The LLDS was higher in females and positively associated with age and educational level. The LLDS is based on the latest international evidence for dietdisease relations at the food group level and has high capacity to discriminate people with widely different intakes.

2901d242a0e14ccc8fedef60f2ed6a26,Does cesarean delivery impact infant weight gain and adiposity over the first year of life?,"Potentially driven by the lack of mothertoinfant transmission of microbiota at birth, cesarean delivery has been associated with higher risk of offspring obesity. Yet, no studies have examined when deliverymode differences in adiposity begin to emerge. In this study, we examine differences in infant weight and adiposity trajectories from birth to 12 months by delivery mode. From 2013 to 2015, we recruited pregnant women into the Nurture Study and followed up their 666 infants. We ascertained maternal delivery method and infant birth weight from medical records. We measured weight, length, and skinfold thicknesses (subscapular, triceps, abdominal) when infants were 3, 6, 9, and 12 months of age. The main outcome, infant weightforlength z score, was derived based on the WHO Child Growth Standards. We used linear regression models to assess the difference at each time point and used linear mixed models to examine the growth rate for infant weight and adiposity trajectories. We controlled for maternal age, race, marital status, education level, household income, smoking status, maternal prepregnancy body mass index, and infant birth weight. Of the 563 infants in our final sample, 179 (31.8%) were cesarean delivered. From birth to 12 months, the rate of increase in weightforlength z score was 0.02month (p  0.03) greater for cesareandelivered than vaginallydelivered infants. As a result of more rapid growth, cesareandelivered infants had higher weightforlength z score (0.26, 95% CI: 0.05, 0.47) and sum of subscapular and triceps (SS  TR) skinfold thickness (0.95 mm, 95% CI: 0.30, 1.60)an indicator for overall adiposityat 12 months, compared to vaginallydelivered infants. Compared to vaginal delivery, cesarean delivery was associated with greater offspring rate of weight gain over the first year and differences in adiposity that appear as early as 3 months of age.

Furthermore, ZNF746 enhanced the stability of cMyc via their direct binding through nuclear colocalization by immunoprecipitation and immunofluorescence, while ZNF746 and cMyc exist mainly in nucleoplasm. Conversely, ZNF746 depletion attenuated phosphorylation of cMyc (S62) and glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3) (S9) and also activated pcMyc (T58), which was reversed by GSK3 inhibitors such as SB216763 and Enza. Also, cMyc degradation by ZNF746 depletion was blocked by knockdown of FboxWD repeatcontaining protein 7 (FBW7) ubiquitin ligase or proteosomal inhibitor MG132. Additionally, the growth of ZNF746 depleted HCT116 cancer cells was retarded with decreased expression of ZNF746 and cMyc. Overall, these findings suggest that ZNF746 promotes CRC progression via cMyc stability mediated by GSK3 and FBW7.",Ji Hoon Jung; DeokBeom Jung; Hyunseok Kim; Hyemin Lee; ShiEun Kang; Sanjay K.

The aim of this study was to assess circulating periostin levels at different times after largeartery atherosclerotic (LAA) stroke and their association with stroke. Serum periostin levels were measured using enzymelinked immunosorbent assay on day 1 in 162 patients with LAA stroke and in 108 age and sexmatched controls, on day 6 after stroke in 134 patients, and during the 4th week after stroke in 46 of the 162 patients. Stroke severity was determined using the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS), and the stroke volume was measured. Outcome at 3 months was measured using the modified Rankin Scale (mRS). Our results indicated that periostin levels increased significantly on day 6 after stroke, and this increasing trend persisted for at least 4 weeks after the event. In addition, the increase in periostin levels was positively correlated with the NIHSS scores and stroke volume, but not with the mRS scores after adjusting for the NIHSS scores. In conclusion, these findings suggest that the increase in serum periostin levels observed after stroke may be associated with the stroke severity in patients with LAA stroke.",Xinwei He; Yuyan Bao; Yuguang Shen; En Wang; Weijun Hong; Shaofa Ke; Xiaoping Jin,Prognostic markers; Stroke,"Department of Neurology, Taizhou Hospital, Wenzhou Medical University, Zhejiang, China; Department of Neurology, Taizhou Hospital, Wenzhou Medical University, Zhejiang, China; Department of Neurology, Taizhou Hospital, Wenzhou Medical University, Zhejiang, China; Department of Neurology, Taizhou Hospital, Wenzhou Medical University, Zhejiang, China; Department of Neurology, Taizhou Hospital, Wenzhou Medical University, Zhejiang, China; Department of Neurology, Taizhou Hospital, Wenzhou Medical University, Zhejiang, China; Department of Neurology, Taizhou Hospital, Wenzhou Medical University, Zhejiang, China"

This study explored the impacts of DBP on the metabolic pathways of microbes in black soils in the short term (20 days). The results showed that the microbial communities were changed in black soils with DBP. In nitrogen cycling, the abundances of the genes were elevated by DBP. DBP contamination facilitated 3phosphoadenosine5phosphosulfate (PAPS) formation, and the gene flux of sulfate metabolism was increased. The total abundances of ABC transporters and the gene abundances of the monosaccharidetransporting ATPases MalK and MsmK were increased by DBP. The total abundance of twocomponent system (TCS) genes and the gene abundances of malate dehydrogenase, histidine kinase and citrylCoA lyase were increased after DBP contamination. The total abundance of phosphotransferase system (PTS) genes and the gene abundances of phosphotransferase, Crr and BglF were raised by DBP. The increased gene abundances of ABC transporters, TCS and PTS could be the reasons for the acceleration of nitrogen, carbon and sulfate metabolism. The degradinggenes of DBP were increased markedly in soil exposed to DBP. In summary, DBP contamination altered the microbial community and enhanced the gene abundances of the carbon, nitrogen and sulfur metabolism in black soils in the short term.",Weihui Xu; Yimin You; Zhigang Wang; Wenjing Chen; Jin Zeng; Xiaosong Zhao; Yunpeng Su,Environmental impact; Environmental microbiology,"School of Life Science and Agriculture and Forestry, Qiqihar University, Qiqihar, China; State Key Laboratory of Lake Science and Environment, Nanjing Institute of Geography and Limnology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Nanjing, China; Key Laboratory of Urban Agriculture in South China, Ministry of Agriculture, Guangzhou, China; School of Life Science and Agriculture and Forestry, Qiqihar University, Qiqihar, China; School of Life Science and Agriculture and Forestry, Qiqihar University, Qiqihar, China; Institute for Environmental Genomics, Department of Microbiology and Plant Biology, University of Oklahoma, Norman, USA; State Key Laboratory of Lake Science and Environment, Nanjing Institute of Geography and Limnology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Nanjing, China; Key Laboratory of Urban Agriculture in South China, Ministry of Agriculture, Guangzhou, China; School of Life Science and Agriculture and Forestry, Qiqihar University, Qiqihar, China; State Key Laboratory of Lake Science and Environment, Nanjing Institute of Geography and Limnology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Nanjing, China; Key Laboratory of Urban Agriculture in South China, Ministry of Agriculture, Guangzhou, China; School of Life Science and Agriculture and Forestry, Qiqihar University, Qiqihar, China; School of Life Science and Agriculture and Forestry, Qiqihar University, Qiqihar, China"

d76fcb624ce540159a7cdc24a2765e21,Accumbens Mechanisms for Cued Sucrose Seeking,"Many studies support a perspective that addictive drugs usurp brain circuits used by natural rewards, especially for the dopaminedependent reinforcing qualities of both drugs and natural rewards. Reinstated drug seeking in animal models of relapse relies on glutamate spillover from cortical terminals synapsing in the nucleus accumbens core (NAcore) to stimulate metabotropic glutamate receptor5 (mGluR5) on neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) interneurons. Contrasting the release of dopamine that is shared by sucrose and drugs of abuse, reinstated sucrose seeking does not induce glutamate spillover. We hypothesized that pharmacologically promoting glutamate spillover in the NAcore would mimic cocaineinduced adaptations and potentiate cued reinstatement of sucrose seeking. Inducing glutamate spillover by blocking astroglial glutamate transporters (GLT1) had no effect on reinstated sucrose seeking. However, glutamate release probability is negatively regulated by presynaptic mGluR23, and sucrose reinstatement was potentiated following mGluR23 blockade. Potentiated sucrose reinstatement by mGluR23 blockade was reversed by antagonizing mGluR5, but reinstated sucrose seeking in the absence of mGluR23 blockade was not affected by blocking mGluR5. In cocainetrained rodents mGluR5 stimulation reinstates drug seeking by activating nNOS, but activating mGluR5 did not promote reinstated sucrose seeking, nor was potentiated reinstatement after mGluR23 blockade reduced by blocking nNOS. However, chemogenetic activation of nNOS interneurons in the NAcore reinstated sucrose seeking. These data indicate that dysregulated presynaptic mGluR23 signaling is a possible site of shared signaling in drug seeking and potentiated reinstated sucrose seeking, but that downregulated glutamate transport and subsequent activation of nNOS by synaptic glutamate spillover is not shared.",AnaClara Bobadilla; Constanza GarciaKeller; Jasper A Heinsbroek; Michael D Scofield; Victoria Chareunsouk; Cara Monforton; Peter W Kalivas,Motivation; Reward,"Department of Neurosciences, Medical University of South Carolina, Charleston, USA; Department of Neurosciences, Medical University of South Carolina, Charleston, USA; Department of Neurosciences, Medical University of South Carolina, Charleston, USA; Department of Neurosciences, Medical University of South Carolina, Charleston, USA; Department of Neurosciences, Medical University of South Carolina, Charleston, USA; Department of Neurosciences, Medical University of South Carolina, Charleston, USA; Department of Neurosciences, Medical University of South Carolina, Charleston, USA"

Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and adipocyte fatty acid binding protein (AFABP) play key roles in obesity and mediate inflammatory activity through similar signaling pathways. However, little is known about their interplay in lipidinduced inflammatory responses. Here, we showed that prolonged treatment of palmitic acid (PA) increased ER stress and expression of AFABP, which was accompanied by reduced autophagic flux in macrophages. Overexpression of AFABP impaired PAinduced autophagy associating with enhanced ER stress and proinflammatory cytokine production, while genetic ablation or pharmacological inhibition of AFABP reversed the conditions. PAinduced expression of autophagyrelated protein (Atg)7 was attenuated in AFABP overexpressed macrophages, but was elevated in AFABPdeficient macrophages. Mechanistically, AFABP potentiated the effects of PA by inhibition of Janus Kinase (JAK)2 activity, thus diminished PAinduced Atg7 expression contributing to impaired autophagy and further augmentation of ER stress. These findings suggest that AFABP acts as autophagy inhibitor to instigate toxic lipidsinduced ER stress through inhibition of JAK2dependent autophagy, which in turn triggers inflammatory responses in macrophages. AFABPJAK2 axis may represent an important pathological pathway contributing to obesityrelated inflammatory diseases.",Ruby L. C. Hoo; Lingling Shu; Kenneth K. Y.

Oxygen isotopes, in particular, are affected by the carbon and water cycles. Being a useful tracer that directly probes governing processes in CO2 biogeochemical cycles, 17O (ln(1  17O)  0.516  ln(1  18O)) provides an alternative constraint on the strengths of the associated cycles involving CO2. Here, we analyze 17O data from four places (Taipei, Taiwan; South China Sea; La Jolla, United States; Jerusalem, Israel) in the northern hemisphere (with a total of 455 measurements) and find a rather narrow range (0.326  0.005). A conservative estimate places a lower limit of 345  70 PgC year1 on the cycling flux between the terrestrial biosphere and atmosphere and infers a residence time of CO2 of 1.9  0.3 years (upper limit) in the atmosphere. A Monte Carlo simulation that takes various plant uptake scenarios into account yields a terrestrial gross primary productivity of 120  30 PgC year1 and soil invasion of 110  30 PgC year1, providing a quantitative assessment utilizing the oxygen isotope anomaly for quantifying CO2 cycling.",MaoChang Liang; Sasadhar Mahata; Amzad H.

Overcoming the limitations of previous approaches, Selfiedigital PCR allows for the quantification of nuclear and mitochondrial gene transcription in a strandspecific manner that is comparable among tissues and cell types that differ in gene copy number or metabolic state. Using Selfiedigital PCR, we found that, with the exception of the liver, different organs exhibit marked variations in mitochondrial DNA copy number but similar transcription of mitochondrial DNA heavy and light chains, thus suggesting a preferential role of mitochondrial DNA abundance over its transcription in organ function. Moreover, the strandspecific analysis of mitochondrial transcription afforded by Selfiedigital PCR showed that transcription of the heavy strand was significantly higher than that of the light strand in all the tissues studied.",Petar Podlesniy; Ramon Trullas,Mitochondria; Transcription,"Neurobiology Unit.

For lowenergy photons, new designs have generated new types of noise that degrade the formedimage signaltonoise ratio to values lower than 1. Fixedpattern noise (FPN), which is produced by the nonuniform focalplanearray optoelectronics response, is an illposed problem in infrared and hyperspectral imaging science. Here, we experimentally show that the FPN behaves as an object at a depth of infinity when a light field is captured by an imaging system. The proposed method is based on the capture of the light field of a scene and digital refocusing to any nearby objects in the scene. Unlike standard techniques for FPN reduction, our method does not require knowledge of the physical parameters of the optoelectronic transducer, the motion scene, or the presence of offline blackbody sources. The ability of the proposed method to reduce FPN is measured by evaluating the structural similarity (SSIM) index employing a blackbodybased FPN reduction technique as a reference.

This changes when they are exposed to ultrashort and highly intense laser pulses. Different interaction mechanisms lead to the appearance of various transient nonlinear optical phenomena. Using these, the optical properties of dielectrics can be controlled from the transparent to the metallike state. Here we expand this range by a yet unexplored mechanism in excited dielectrics: amplification. In a twocolour pumpprobe experiment, we show that a 400 nm femtosecond laser pulse is coherently amplified inside an excited sapphire sample on a scale of a few micrometres. Simulations strongly support the proposed twophoton stimulated emission process, which is temporally and spatially controllable. Consequently, we expect applications in all fields that demand strongly localized amplification. Ultrashort highintensity laser pulses change the properties of dielectrics in different ways.

The nascent field of network neuroscience applies tools from mathematics to neuroimaging data in the hope of shedding light on cognitive function. A critical question arising from these empirical studies is how to modulate a human brain network to treat cognitive deficits or enhance mental abilities. While historically a number of tools have been employed to modulate mental states (such as cognitive behavioural therapy and brain stimulation), theoretical frameworks to guide these interventionsand to optimize them for clinical useare fundamentally lacking. One promising and as yet underexplored approach lies in a subdiscipline of engineering known as network control theory. Here, we posit that network control fundamentally relates to mind control, and that this relationship highlights important areas for future empirical research and opportunities to translate knowledge into practical domains. We clarify the conceptual intersection between neuroanatomy, cognition, and control engineering in the context of network neuroscience. Finally, we discuss the challenges, ethics, and promises of mind control.

                        Plutella xylostella has become the major lepidopteran pest of Brassica owing to its strong ability of resistance development to a wide range of insecticides. Destruxin A, a mycotoxin of entomopathogenic fungus, Metarhizium anisopliae, has broadspectrum insecticidal effects. However, the interaction mechanism of destruxin A with the immune system of P. xylostella at genomic level is still not well understood. Here, we identified 129 immunityrelated genes, including pattern recognition receptors, signal modulators, few members of main immune pathways (Toll, Imd, and JAKSTAT), and immune effectors in P. xylostella in response to destruxin A at three different time courses (2 h, 4 h, and 6 h). It is worthy to mention that the immunityrelated differentially expressed genes (DEGs) analysis exhibited 30, 78, and 72 upregulated and 17, 13, and 6 downregulated genes in P. xylostella after destruxin A injection at 2 h, 4 h, and 6 h, respectively, compared to control. Interestingly, our results revealed that the expression of antimicrobial peptides that play a vital role in insect immune system was upregulated after the injection of destruxin A. Our findings provide a detailed information on immunityrelated DEGs and reveal the potential of P. xylostella to limit the infection of fungal peptide destruxin A by increasing the activity of antimicrobial peptides.",Muhammad Shakeel; Xiaoxia Xu; Jin Xu; Xun Zhu; Shuzhong Li; Xianqiang Zhou; Jialin Yu; Xiaojing Xu; Qiongbo Hu; Xiaoqiang Yu; Fengliang Jin,Environmental sciences; Microbiology,"College of Agriculture, South China Agricultural University, Laboratory of BioPesticide Creation and Application of Guangdong Province, Guangzhou, P.R.

c8129ff7b30345999d6a541138ec5bd5,Temperature based Restricted Boltzmann Machines,"Restricted Boltzmann machines (RBMs), which apply graphical models to learning probability distribution over a set of inputs, have attracted much attention recently since being proposed as building blocks of multilayer learning systems called deep belief networks (DBNs). Note that temperature is a key factor of the Boltzmann distribution that RBMs originate from. However, none of existing schemes have considered the impact of temperature in the graphical model of DBNs. In this work, we propose temperature based restricted Boltzmann machines (TRBMs) which reveals that temperature is an essential parameter controlling the selectivity of the firing neurons in the hidden layers. We theoretically prove that the effect of temperature can be adjusted by setting the parameter of the sharpness of the logistic function in the proposed TRBMs. The performance of RBMs can be improved by adjusting the temperature parameter of TRBMs. This work provides a comprehensive insights into the deep belief networks and deep learning architectures from a physical point of view.",Guoqi Li; Lei Deng; Yi Xu; Changyun Wen; Wei Wang; Jing Pei; Luping Shi,Applied physics; Computational science,"Department of Precision Instrument, Center for Brain Inspired Computing Research, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China; Department of Precision Instrument, Center for Brain Inspired Computing Research, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China; School of Computing Enginering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore; School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore; School of Automation Science and Electrical Engineering, Beihang University, Beijing, China; Department of Precision Instrument, Center for Brain Inspired Computing Research, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China; Department of Precision Instrument, Center for Brain Inspired Computing Research, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"

Gene selection is a popular technology for cancer classification that aims to identify a small number of informative genes from thousands of genes that may contribute to the occurrence of cancers to obtain a high predictive accuracy. This technique has been extensively studied in recent years. This study develops a novel feature selection (FS) method for gene subset selection by utilizing the Weight Local Modularity (WLM) in a complex network, called the WLMGS. In the proposed method, the discriminative power of gene subset is evaluated by using the weight local modularity of a weighted sample graph in the gene subset where the intraclass distance is small and the interclass distance is large. A higher local modularity of the gene subset corresponds to a greater discriminative of the gene subset. With the use of forward search strategy, a more informative gene subset as a group can be selected for the classification process. Computational experiments show that the proposed algorithm can select a small subset of the predictive gene as a group while preserving classification accuracy.",Guodong Zhao; Yan Wu,Computer science; Machine learning,"School of Electronics and Information Engineering, Tongji University, Shanghai, China; School of Electronics and Information Engineering, Tongji University, Shanghai, China"

Compound rechallenge after drug holidays can overcome such resistance, yet little is known about the impact of drug holidays on cell biochemistry. We found that PI3K inhibitor (PI3Ki)resistant cells cultured in the absence of PI3Ki developed a proliferative defect, increased oxygen consumption and accumulated reactive oxygen species (ROS), leading to lactate production through hypoxiainducible factor1. This metabolic imbalance was reversed by mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) inhibitors. Interestingly, neither AKT nor cMYC was involved in mediating the metabolic phenotype, despite the latter contributing to resistant cells' proliferation. These data suggest that an AKTindependent PI3KmTORC1 axis operates in these cells. The excessive ROS hampered cell division, and the metabolic phenotype made resistant cells more sensitive to hydrogen peroxide and nutrient starvation. Thus, the proliferative defect of PI3Kiresistant cells during drug holidays is caused by defective metabolic adaptation to chronic PI3KmTOR pathway inhibition. This metabolic imbalance may open the therapeutic window for challenge with metabolic drugs during drug holidays.",M Dermit; P Casado; V Rajeeve; E H Wilkes; D E Foxler; H Campbell; S Critchlow; T V Sharp; J G Gribben; R Unwin; P R Cutillas,Cancer metabolism,"Cell Signalling  Proteomics, Centre for HaematoOncology, Barts Cancer Institute, Queen Mary University of London, London, UK; Cell Signalling  Proteomics, Centre for HaematoOncology, Barts Cancer Institute, Queen Mary University of London, London, UK; Cell Signalling  Proteomics, Centre for HaematoOncology, Barts Cancer Institute, Queen Mary University of London, London, UK; Cell Signalling  Proteomics, Centre for HaematoOncology, Barts Cancer Institute, Queen Mary University of London, London, UK; Centre for Molecular Oncology, Barts Cancer Institute, Queen Mary University of London, London, UK; AstraZeneca, Oncology iMED, Cheshire, UK; AstraZeneca, Oncology iMED, Cheshire, UK; Centre for Molecular Oncology, Barts Cancer Institute, Queen Mary University of London, London, UK; Cancer Immunology Group, Centre for HaematoOncology, Barts Cancer Institute, Queen Mary University of London, London, UK; UCL Centre for Nephrology, Royal Free Campus and Hospital, University College London, London, UK; Cell Signalling  Proteomics, Centre for HaematoOncology, Barts Cancer Institute, Queen Mary University of London, London, UK"
9e1c4563d647454f85daa68e45a1c973,ASH1L histone methyltransferase regulates the handoff between damage recognition factors in globalgenome nucleotide excision repair,"Globalgenome nucleotide excision repair (GGNER) prevents ultraviolet (UV) lightinduced skin cancer by removing mutagenic cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (CPDs). These lesions are formed abundantly on DNA wrapped around histone octamers in nucleosomes, but a specialized damage sensor known as DDB2 ensures that they are accessed by the XPC initiator of GGNER activity. We report that DDB2 promotes CPD excision by recruiting the histone methyltransferase ASH1L, which methylates lysine 4 of histone H3. In turn, methylated H3 facilitates the docking of the XPC complex to nucleosomal histone octamers. Consequently, DDB2, ASH1L and XPC proteins colocalize transiently on histone H3methylated nucleosomes of UVexposed cells. In the absence of ASH1L, the chromatin binding of XPC is impaired and its ability to recruit downstream GGNER effectors diminished. Also, ASH1L depletion suppresses CPD excision and confers UV hypersensitivity. These findings show that ASH1L configures chromatin for the effective handoff between damage recognition factors during GGNER activity. UVinduced mutagenic cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers on nucleosomal DNA are sensed by the damage recognition factors DDB2 and XPC via an unknown mechanism. Here, the authors show that the histone methyltransferase ASH1L regulates the DDB2 to XPC handoff by methylating Lys4 of histone H3.",Chiara Balbo Pogliano; Marco Gatti; Peter Ruthemann; Zuzana Garajova; Lorenza Penengo; Hanspeter Naegeli,DNA; Histone posttranslational modifications; Methylation; Nucleotide excision repair,"Institute of Pharmacology and Toxicology, University of ZurichVetsuisse, Zurich, Switzerland; Department of Molecular Mechanisms of Disease, University of Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland; Institute of Molecular Cancer Research, University of Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland; Institute of Pharmacology and Toxicology, University of ZurichVetsuisse, Zurich, Switzerland; Institute of Pharmacology and Toxicology, University of ZurichVetsuisse, Zurich, Switzerland; Institute of Molecular Cancer Research, University of Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland; Institute of Pharmacology and Toxicology, University of ZurichVetsuisse, Zurich, Switzerland"

However, such complex interactions among categorical perception and other aspects of sensory processing have not been explained well in a unified manner. Here, we propose a recurrent neural network model to process categorical information of stimuli, which approximately realizes a hierarchical Bayesian estimation on stimuli. The model accounts for a wide variety of neurophysiological and cognitive phenomena in a consistent framework. In particular, the reported complexity of categorical effects, including (i) taskdependent modulation of neural response, (ii) clustering of neural population representation, (iii) temporal evolution of perceptual color memory and (iv) a nonuniform discrimination threshold, are explained as different aspects of a single model. Moreover, we directly examine key model behaviors in the monkey visual cortex by analyzing neural population dynamics during categorization and discrimination of color stimuli. We find that the categorical task causes temporallyevolving biases in the neuronal population representations toward the focal colors, which supports the proposed model. These results suggest that categorical perception can be achieved by recurrent neural dynamics that approximates optimal probabilistic inference in the changing environment.",Chihiro I.

We present modeling work that develops a probabilistic inference model of this historydependent bias, and links our probabilistic model to computations of a recurrent network wherein shortterm facilitation accounts for the observed bias. Network connectivity is reshaped dynamically during each trial, generating predictions from prior trial observations. Applying timescale separation methods, we obtain a lowdimensional description of the trialtotrial bias based on the history of target locations. Furthermore, we demonstrate task protocols for which our model with facilitation performs better than a model with static connectivity: repetitively presented targets are better retained in working memory than targets drawn from uncorrelated sequences.",Zachary P.

Certain and highly likely diagnoses were made in 1838 (47%) individuals, including identifying two new developmental disorders. The majority of diagnoses (70%) were due to our bioinformatics, phenotyping, and targeted testing identifying variants that were undetected or not prioritized on prior ES. GS diagnosed 318 individuals with structural variants not amenable to ES. Additionally, tentative diagnoses were made in 3 (8%), and in 5 individuals (13%) candidate genes were identified. Overall, diagnosespotential leads were identified in 2638 (68%).

During transmission, the parasites in the form of sporozoites, are injected together with mosquito saliva into the skin. However, the contribution of vector saliva to sporozoite activity during the establishment of the initial infection of the liver is poorly understood. Here we identify a vector protein by mass spectrometry, with similarity to the human gamma interferon inducible thiol reductase (GILT), that is associated with saliva sporozoites of infected Anopheles mosquitoes and has a negative impact on the speed and cell traversal activity of Plasmodium. This protein, referred to as mosquito GILT (mosGILT) represents an example of a protein found in mosquito saliva that may negatively influence sporozoite movement in the host and could lead to new approaches to prevent malaria. Mosquito saliva can affect transmission of Plasmodium to mammalian hosts, but active saliva components or mechanisms are poorly understood.

Therefore, pathogens have to cope with stressful conditions at the site of infection. Peroxiredoxins (Prx) are highly reactive and abundant peroxidases that can support virulence and persistence of pathogens in distinct hosts. Here, we revealed that the opportunistic human pathogen A. fumigatus presents three 1Cys Prx (Prx6 subfamily), which is unprecedented. We showed that PrxB and PrxC were in mitochondria, while Prx1 was in cytosol. As observed for other Prxs, recombinant Prx1 and PrxC decomposed H2O2 at elevated velocities (rate constants in the 107 M1s1 range). Deletion mutants for each Prx displayed higher sensitivity to oxidative challenge in comparison with the wildtype strain. Additionally, cytosolic Prx1 was important for A. fumigatus survival upon electron transport dysfunction. Expression of Prxs was dependent on the SakAHOG1 MAP kinase and the Yap1YAP1 transcription factor, a global regulator of the oxidative stress response in fungi. Finally, cytosolic Prx1 played a major role in pathogenicity, since it is required for full virulence, using a neutropenic mouse infection model. Our data indicate that the three 1Cys Prxs act together to maintain the redox balance of A. fumigatus.",Marina Campos Rocha; Krissia Franco de Godoy; Renata BannitzFernandes; Joao H. T.

Loss of function of any of the two components ultimately leads to serious B12 deficiency and urinary protein loss in humans (ImerslundGrasbeck's syndrome, IGS). Here, we present the crystal structure of AMN in complex with the aminoterminal region of cubilin, revealing a sophisticated assembly of three cubilin subunits combining into a single intertwined helix domain that docks to a corresponding threefaced helix domain in AMN. This helixhelix association thereby anchors three ligandbinding cubilin subunits to the transmembrane AMN. Electron microscopy of fulllength cubam reveals a 700800 A long treelike structure with the potential of dimerization into an even larger complex. Furthermore, effects of known human mutations causing IGS are explained by the structural information. Cubilin and the transmembrane protein amnionless (AMN) form the endocytic receptor cubam that is essential for intestinal vitamin B12 uptake.

b5af584cedd745a1a26dc95d2e755229,"Pathways of flower infection and pollenmediated dispersion of Pseudomonas syringae pv. actinidiae , the causal agent of kiwifruit bacterial canker","Flowers can provide a protected and nutrientrich environment to the epiphytic microflora, thus representing a sensible entry point for pathogens such as Pseudomonas syringae pv. actinidiae (Psa). This bacterium can colonize both male and female Actinidia flowers, causing flower browning and fall, and systemic invasion of the host plant, eventually leading to its death. However, the process of flower colonization and penetration into the host tissues has not yet been fully elucidated. In addition, the presence of Psa in the pollen from infected flowers, and the role of pollination in the spread of Psa requires confirmation. The present study employed a Psa strain constitutively expressing the fluorescent GFPuv protein, to visualize in vivo flower colonization. Microscopy observations were performed by means of confocal laser scanning and widefield fluorescent microscopy, and were coupled with the study of Psa population dynamics by quantitative PCR (qPCR). The pathogen was shown to colonize stigmata, move along the stylar furrow, and penetrate the receptacles via the style or nectarhodes. Once the receptacle was invaded, the pathogen migrated along the flower pedicel and became systemic. Psa was also able to colonize the anthers epiphytically and endophytically. Infected male flowers produced contaminated pollen, which could transmit Psa to healthy plants. Finally, pollinators (Apis mellifera and Bombus terrestris) were studied in natural conditions, showing that, although they can be contaminated with Psa, the pathogen's transmission via pollinators is contrasted by its short survival in the hive. Studying the transmission pathways of a bacterium that infects and kills kiwi fruit plants suggests that modified plant protection strategies could minimize the risk of disease. Researchers in Italy and New Zealand, led by Francesco Spinelli at the University of Bologna, investigated Pseudomonas syringae pv. Actinidiae (Psa), which causes kiwi fruit bacterial canker. This has been a major problem worldwide since a pandemic outbreak in 2008. The results show that flower tissues, especially the stigmata which receive transmitted pollen, are crucial sites allowing Psa to grow and penetrate into the plants. Evidence is presented of bacterial transmission via the pollen dispersed from plants that do not themselves show signs of infection. Suggested new control strategies include inspecting and treating pollendonating plants, and using biological agents to compete with Psa growing inside kiwi fruit flowers.",Irene Donati; Antonio Cellini; Giampaolo Buriani; Sofia Mauri; Callum Kay; Gianni Tacconi; Francesco Spinelli,Microbiology; Plant immunity,"Department of Agricultural and Food Sciences  DISTAL, Alma Mater StudiorumUniversity of Bologna, Bologna, Italy; Department of Agricultural and Food Sciences  DISTAL, Alma Mater StudiorumUniversity of Bologna, Bologna, Italy; Department of Agricultural and Food Sciences  DISTAL, Alma Mater StudiorumUniversity of Bologna, Bologna, Italy; Department of Agricultural and Food Sciences  DISTAL, Alma Mater StudiorumUniversity of Bologna, Bologna, Italy; ZESPRI GLOBAL Supply, Mount Maunganui, New Zealand; Consiglio per la Ricerca e la Sperimentazione in AgricolturaGenomics Research Centre, Fiorenzuola d'Arda, Italy; Department of Agricultural and Food Sciences  DISTAL, Alma Mater StudiorumUniversity of Bologna, Bologna, Italy"

Fundamental characteristics of connectome organization can be revealed using the tools of network science and graph theory. Of particular interest is the network's community structure, commonly identified by modularity maximization, where communities are conceptualized as densely intraconnected and sparsely interconnected. Here we adopt a generative modeling approach called weighted stochastic block models (WSBM) that can describe a wider range of community structure topologies by explicitly considering patterned interactions between communities. We apply this method to the study of changes in the human connectome that occur across the life span (between 685 years old). We find that WSBM communities exhibit greater hemispheric symmetry and are spatially less compact than those derived from modularity maximization. We identify several network blocks that exhibit significant linear and nonlinear changes across age, with the most significant changes involving subregions of prefrontal cortex.

Vector control strategies have been hindered by mosquito and pathogen resistances, and population alteration approaches using transgenic mosquitos still have many hurdles to overcome before they can be implemented in the field. Here we report a paratransgenic control strategy in which the microbiota of Anopheles stephensi was engineered to produce an antiplasmodial effector causing the mosquito to become refractory to Plasmodium berghei. The midgut symbiont Asaia was used to conditionally express the antiplasmodial protein scorpine only when a blood meal was present. These blood meal inducible Asaia strains significantly inhibit pathogen infection, and display improved fitness compared to strains that constitutively express the antiplasmodial effector. This strategy may allow the antiplasmodial bacterial strains to survive and be transmitted through mosquito populations, creating an easily implemented and enduring vector control strategy. Vector alteration strategies are emerging as attractive tools for malaria transmission control.

It has been suggested that merging of mainsequence and premainsequence stars could produce such strong fields4,5, and the predicted fraction of merged massive stars is also about ten per cent6,7. The merger hypothesis is further supported by a lack of magnetic stars in close binaries8,9, which is as expected if mergers produce magnetic stars. Here we report threedimensional magnetohydrodynamical simulations of the coalescence of two massive stars and follow the evolution of the merged product. Strong magnetic fields are produced in the simulations, and the merged star rejuvenates such that it appears younger and bluer than other coeval stars. This can explain the properties of the magnetic 'blue straggler' star  Sco in the Upper Scorpius association that has an observationally inferred, apparent age of less than five million years, which is less than half the age of its birth association10. Such massive blue straggler stars seem likely to be progenitors of magnetars, perhaps giving rise to some of the enigmatic fast radio bursts observed11, and their supernovae may be affected by their strong magnetic fields12.

However, visual sensation is an active process, and if there are any brain areas that ought to be particularly in tune with natural scene statistics, it would be sensorymotor areas critical for guiding behavior. Here we found that the rhesus macaque superior colliculus, a structure instrumental for rapid visual exploration with saccades, detects low spatial frequencies, which are the most prevalent in natural scenes, much more rapidly than high spatial frequencies. Importantly, this accelerated detection happens independently of whether a neuron is more or less sensitive to low spatial frequencies to begin with. At the population level, the superior colliculus additionally overrepresents low spatial frequencies in neural response sensitivity, even at nearfoveal eccentricities. Thus, the superior colliculus possesses both temporal and response gain mechanisms for efficient gaze realignment in lowspatialfrequencydominated natural environments. In primates, the superior colliculus (SC) contributes to rapid visual exploration with saccades. Here the authors show that the superior colliculus preferentially represents low spatial frequencies, which are the most prevalent in natural scenes.",ChihYang Chen; Lukas Sonnenberg; Simone Weller; Thede Witschel; Ziad M.

Here we present the analysis of genomic sequence and transcriptomic exploration for A. cerana as well as the comparative genomic analysis of the Asian honeybee and the European honeybee A. mellifera. The genome and RNAseq data yield new insights into the behavioral and physiological resistance to the parasitic mite Varroa the evolution of antimicrobial peptides, and the genetic basis for labor division in A. cerana. Comparison of genes between the two sister species revealed genes specific to A. cerana, 54.5% of which have no homology to any known proteins. The observation that A. cerana displayed significantly more vigilant grooming behaviors to the presence of Varroa than A. mellifera in conjunction with gene expression analysis suggests that parasitedefensive grooming in A. cerana is likely triggered not only by exogenous stimuli through visual and olfactory detection of the parasite, but also by genetically endogenous processes that periodically activates a bout of grooming to remove the ectoparasite. This information provides a valuable platform to facilitate the traits unique to A. cerana as well as those shared with other social bees for health improvement.",Qingyun Diao; Liangxian Sun; Huajun Zheng; Zhijiang Zeng; Shengyue Wang; Shufa Xu; Huoqing Zheng; Yanping Chen; Yuanyuan Shi; Yuezhu Wang; Fei Meng; Qingliang Sang; Lianfei Cao; Fang Liu; Yongqiang Zhu; Wenfeng Li; Zhiguo Li; Congjie Dai; Minjun Yang; Shenglu Chen; Runsheng Chen; Shaowu Zhang; Jay D.

Advanced silicon functionalities based on optical nonlinearities are then required. As the presence of inversion symmetry in the Si crystal structure prevents the exploitation of secondorder optical nonlinearities, the generation of strain gradients in Si by a stressed material can be considered. However, due to the semiconductor nature of silicon with the presence of carriers, no clear evidence of secondorder nonlinearities have been reported yet. Here we report an experimental demonstration of highspeed Pockels effect in silicon waveguides at 1550 nm. Additionally, a theoretical model is developed to describe its frequency behavior.

Patients with FXS suffer lifelong cognitive disabilities, but the function of FMRP in the adult brain and the mechanism underlying agerelated cognitive decline in FXS is not fully understood. Here, we report that a loss of FMRP results in increased protein synthesis of histone acetyltransferase EP300 and ubiquitinationmediated degradation of histone deacetylase HDAC1 in adult hippocampal neural stem cells (NSCs). Consequently, FMRPdeficient NSCs exhibit elevated histone acetylation and agerelated NSC depletion, leading to cognitive impairment in mature adult mice. Reducing histone acetylation rescues both neurogenesis and cognitive deficits in mature adult FMRPdeficient mice. Our work reveals a role for FMRP and histone acetylation in cognition and presents a potential novel therapeutic strategy for treating adult FXS patients. Loss of fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP) leads to fragile X syndrome, associated with cognitive dysfunction. Here the authors show that mice lacking FMRP show reduced hippocampal neurogenesis and cognitive deficits, which can be rescued by reducing histone acetylation.",Yue Li; Michael E. Stockton; Brian E.

Direct comparison of healthy aging populations with schizophrenia and BD patients across the adult lifespan may help inform this theory. In total, 225 individuals (91 healthy controls, 81 schizophrenia, 53 euthymic BD) underwent 3T T1weighted magnetic resonance imaging, diffusion tensor imaging, and cognitive testing. We analyzed associations among age, diagnosis, and cognition with cortical thickness and fractional anisotropy (FA) using general linear models. We then assessed ""brain age"" using a random forest algorithm, which was also assessed in an independent sample (n  147). Participants with schizophrenia had lower cortical thickness and FA compared with the other two groups, most prominently in frontotemporal circuitry. These brain changes were more evident in younger participants than in older ones, yet were associated with cognitive performance independent of diagnosis. Predicted age was 8 years greater than chronological age in individuals with schizophrenia in the first sample and 6 years greater in the second sample. Predicted and chronological age were not different in BD. Differences in brain circuitry are present from illness onset most prominently in schizophrenia and to a lesser extent in BD.

3b9f880e48044b15ba32cf19ac7d5135,Restriction of HIV1 and other retroviruses by TRIM5,"Mammalian cells express a variety of innate immune proteins  known as restriction factors  which defend against invading retroviruses such as HIV1. Two members of the tripartite motif protein family  TRIM5 and TRIMCyp  were identified in 2004 as restriction factors that recognize and inactivate the capsid shell that surrounds and protects the incoming retroviral core. Research on these TRIM5 proteins has uncovered a novel mode of nonself recognition that protects against crossspecies transmission of retroviruses. Our developing understanding of the mechanism of TRIM5 restriction underscores the concept that core uncoating and reverse transcription of the viral genome are coordinated processes rather than discrete steps of the postentry pathway of retrovirus replication. In this Review, we provide an overview of the current state of knowledge of the molecular mechanism of TRIM5mediated restriction, highlight recent advances and discuss implications for the development of capsidtargeted antiviral therapeutics.

Arguably, the success of B cell depletion with rituximab in openlabel studies and in patients with lupus nephritis in the USA and in difficulttotreat patients with SLE in the UK, together with the approval of belimumab (which blocks B cellactivating factor (BAFF)) for use in patients with SLE and the recognition that clinical trial design can be improved, have given some cause for hope. However, changes to therapies in current use and the development of new approaches are urgently needed. The results of the latest studies investigating the use of several new approaches to treating SLE are discussed in this Review, including: fully humanized antiCD20 and antiCD19 monoclonal antibodies; inhibition of tyrosineprotein kinase BTK; CD40 ligand blockade; interfering with the presentation of antigen to autoreactive T cells using a peptide approach; a receptor decoy approach using an analogue of Fc receptor IIB; dual blockade of IL12 and IL23; and inhibition of Janus kinases. A series of successive failures of new therapies for systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) in clinical trials has left clinicians with limited options to treat this disease.

5583ccd55f12479f9635abf21f216564,Chemistry from 3D printed objects,"3D printing technology has started to take hold as an enabling tool for scientific advancement. Born from the marriage of computeraided design and additive manufacturing, 3D printing was originally intended to generate prototypes for inspection before their full industrial production. As this field has matured, its reach into other applications has expanded, accelerated by its ability to generate 3D objects with complex geometries. Chemists and chemical engineers have begun to take advantage of these capabilities in their own research. Certainly, the most prominent examples of this adoption have been the design and use of 3D printed reaction containers and flow devices. The focus of this Review, however, is on 3D printed objects, the chemical reactivities of which are of primary interest. These types of objects have been designed and used in catalytic, mechanical, electronic, analytical and biological applications. Underlying this research are the efforts to add chemical functionality to standard printing materials, which are often inert. This Review details the different ways in which chemical reactivity is endowed on printed objects, the types of chemical functionality that have been explored in the various printing materials and the reactions that are facilitated by the final printed object. Finally, the Review discusses new avenues for the development and further sophistication of generating chemically active, 3D printed objects. 3D printing technology emerged as a tool for the design and fabrication of prototypes. Chemists are now using this technology to produce chemically reactive materials. In this Review, Hartings and Ahmed discuss different approaches to 3D print chemically reactive objects.

7dda6396877b48b4ab5d48f732df4a9f,Synthesis of ultrathin twodimensional nanosheets and van der Waals heterostructures from nonlayered CuI,"Twodimensional (2D) nanosheets have attracted considerable recent interest for their atomically thin geometry and unique thicknessdependent electronic properties. The 2D nanosheets studied to date are generally limited to intrinsically layered materials, in which the covalently bonded atomic layers are held together by weak van der Waals forces and can be readily exfoliated to single or fewatom thick nanosheets. To prepare 2D nanosheets from nonlayered materials can greatly expand the scope of 2D materials, but is much less straightforward. Here, we report the successful synthesis of ultrathin nanosheets from nonlayered CuI on SiO2Si substrate using a facile physical vapor deposition process. The resulting CuI nanosheets display a triangular and hexagonal geometry with the lateral dimension up to 5 m and thickness down to 1 nm. Raman spectroscopy, Xray diffraction, and transmission electron microscopy studies demonstrate the resulting nanosheets retain singlecrystalline CuI phase. Additionally, we further show the CuI nanosheets can be readily grown on other 2D materials (e.g., 2DWSe2, 2DWS2) to form van der Waals heterostructures (vdWHs). Optical microscopy images and Raman intensity mappings confirm the formation of CuIWS2 and CuIWSe2 vertical heterostructures. The electrical transport studies show that CuI nanosheets exhibit a low resistivity of ~0.3  cm and CuIWS2 vertical heterostructures display a pn diode behavior with distinct current rectification. The synthesis of CuI nanosheets and heterostructures open a pathway to ultrathin nanosheets and van der Waals heterostructures from nonlayered materials and could open up exciting opportunities in electronics and optoelectronics. Nonlayered CuI powders give rise to atomically thin CuI sheets by means of physical vapor deposition under atmospheric pressure. A team led by Xiangfeng Duan at University of California Los Angeles demonstrated that physical vapor deposition can be used to synthesize ultrathin CuI nanosheets from its nonlayered, threedimensional CuI counterpart. The fewatomic thick nanoplatelets retain a singlecrystalline CuI phase, and display triangular and hexagonal crystal symmetry with lateral dimension up to 5 m and thickness down to 1 nm. The CuI nanosheets can grow not only on SiO2Si substrates, but also on other twodimensional materials. As a result, they can form vertical van der Waals heterostructures with WSe2 and WS2, which exhibit pn diode behavior with current rectification.",Kangkang Yao; Peng Chen; Zhengwei Zhang; Jia Li; Ruoqi Ai; Huifang Ma; Bei Zhao; Guangzhuang Sun; Ruixia Wu; Xuwan Tang; Bo Li; Jiawen Hu; Xidong Duan; Xiangfeng Duan,Synthesis and processing; Twodimensional materials,"State Key Laboratory for ChemoBiosensing and Chemometrics, College of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Hunan University, Changsha, China; State Key Laboratory for ChemoBiosensing and Chemometrics, College of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Hunan University, Changsha, China; Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, University of California, Los Angeles, USA; State Key Laboratory for ChemoBiosensing and Chemometrics, College of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Hunan University, Changsha, China; State Key Laboratory for ChemoBiosensing and Chemometrics, College of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Hunan University, Changsha, China; State Key Laboratory for ChemoBiosensing and Chemometrics, College of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Hunan University, Changsha, China; State Key Laboratory for ChemoBiosensing and Chemometrics, College of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Hunan University, Changsha, China; State Key Laboratory for ChemoBiosensing and Chemometrics, College of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Hunan University, Changsha, China; State Key Laboratory for ChemoBiosensing and Chemometrics, College of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Hunan University, Changsha, China; State Key Laboratory for ChemoBiosensing and Chemometrics, College of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Hunan University, Changsha, China; State Key Laboratory for ChemoBiosensing and Chemometrics, College of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Hunan University, Changsha, China; Department of Applied Physics, School of Physics and Electronics, Hunan University, Changsha, China; State Key Laboratory for ChemoBiosensing and Chemometrics, College of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Hunan University, Changsha, China; State Key Laboratory for ChemoBiosensing and Chemometrics, College of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Hunan University, Changsha, China; Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, University of California, Los Angeles, USA"
94c49478a1e242bf963e6eb252f8842d,Cell typedependent function of LATS12 in cancer cell growth,"The Hippo pathway controls organ size and tissue homeostasis, and its dysregulation often contributes to tumorigenesis. Extensive studies have shown that the Hippo pathway inhibits cell proliferation, and survival in a cellautonomous manner. We examined the function of the Hippo pathway kinases LATS12 (large tumor suppressor 1 and 2) in cancer cells. As expected, loss of LATS12 promotes cancer cell growth in most cell lines. Surprisingly, however, LATS12 deletion inhibits the growth of murine MC38 colon cancer cells, especially under detachment conditions. This growth inhibitory effect caused by LATS12 deletion is due to uncontrolled activation of Yesassociated protein (YAP) and transcriptional coactivator with PDZbinding motif (TAZ), the key downstream transcriptional coactivators inhibited by LATS12. We identified Wnt inducible signaling pathway protein 2 (Wisp2) and coiledcoil domain containing 80 (Ccdc80) as direct targets of YAPTAZ. Their expression is selectively induced by LATS12 deletion in MC38 cells. Furthermore, deletion of WISP2 and CCDC80 prevents the growth inhibitory effect of LATS12 loss in MC38 cells. Our study demonstrates that the function of LATS12 in cell growth is cell context dependent, suggesting that LATS12 inhibition can be a therapeutic approach for some cancer types.",WeiWei Pan; Toshiro Moroishi; Ja Hyun Koo; KunLiang Guan,Extracellular signalling molecules; Oncogenes,"Department of Pharmacology and Moores Cancer Center, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, USA; School of Medicine, Jiaxing University, Jiaxing, China; Department of Pharmacology and Moores Cancer Center, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, USA; Department of Molecular Enzymology and Center for Metabolic Regulation of Healthy Aging, Faculty of Life Sciences, Kumamoto University, Kumamoto, Japan; Department of Pharmacology and Moores Cancer Center, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, USA; Department of Pharmacology and Moores Cancer Center, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, USA"

Here, we report two coordination nanocapsules with variable cavities: a contracted octahedral V24 capsule and an expanded ballshaped V24 capsule, both of which are constructed from the same number of subcomponents. The assemblies of these two V24 capsules are solventcontrolled, and capable of reversible conversion between contracted and expanded forms via control of the geometries of the metal centers by association and dissociation with axial water molecules. Following such structural interconversions, the magnetic properties are significantly changed. This work not only provides a strategy for the design and preparation of coordination nanocapsules with adaptable cavities, but also a unique example with which to understand the transformation process and their structureproperty relationships. Adapting the cavity of a coordination capsule generally involves the addition or removal of subcomponents. Here, the authors report two vanadiumorganic coordination nanocapsules with the same number of components but variable cavity sizesan expanded ball and contracted octahedronwhose solventcontrolled interconversion is attributed to the versatile coordination geometry of the vanadium centers.",Kongzhao Su; Mingyan Wu; Daqiang Yuan; Maochun Hong,Coordination chemistry; Molecular capsules,"State Key Laboratory of Structure Chemistry, Fujian Institute of Research on the Structure of Matter, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Fuzhou, Fujian, China; State Key Laboratory of Structure Chemistry, Fujian Institute of Research on the Structure of Matter, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Fuzhou, Fujian, China; State Key Laboratory of Structure Chemistry, Fujian Institute of Research on the Structure of Matter, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Fuzhou, Fujian, China; State Key Laboratory of Structure Chemistry, Fujian Institute of Research on the Structure of Matter, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Fuzhou, Fujian, China"

Here, we studied the dynamics of cumulative culture using a largescale data set from online collaborative programming competitions run over 14 years. We show that, within each contest population, performance increases over time through frequent 'tweaks' of the current best entry and rare innovative 'leaps' (successful tweak:leap ratio  16:1), the latter associated with substantially greater variance in performance. Cumulative cultural evolution reduces technological diversity over time, as populations focus on refining highperformance solutions. While individual entries borrow from few sources, iterative copying allows populations to integrate ideas from many sources, demonstrating a new form of collective intelligence. Our results imply that maximising technological progress requires accepting high levels of failure. The cumulative development of culture has proven difficult to study in the laboratory. Here, the authors examine entries to a series of large programming contests to show that successful entries are usually 'tweaks' of existing solutions, but occasional 'leaps' can bring larger benefits.",Elena Miu; Ned Gulley; Kevin N.

Here, using wildtype C57Bl mice, we investigated the circadian and sleeprelated modulation of electrical neuronal activity in midbrain ventraltegmentalarea (VTA) and substantia nigra (SN). We found no significant circadian modulation of activity in SN while VTA displayed a low amplitude but significant circadian modulation with increased firing rates during the active phase. Combining neural activity recordings with electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings revealed a strong vigilance state dependent modulation of neuronal activity with increased activity during wakefulness and rapid eye movement sleep relative to nonrapid eye movement sleep in both SN and VTA. Sixhours of sleep deprivation induced a significant depression of neuronal activity in both areas. Surprisingly, these alterations lasted for up to 48 hours and persisted even after the normalization of cortical EEG waves. Our results show that sleep and sleep disturbances significantly affect neuronal activity in midbrain DA structures. We propose that these changes in neuronal activity underlie the wellknown relationship between sleep alterations and several disorders involving dysfunction of the DA circuitry such as addiction and depression.",Karim Fifel; Johanna H.

This architecture gives rise to unique properties, like low concentration, high porosity gels with a high mechanical responsiveness as a result of strainstiffening. Here, we used a synthetic polymer model system, based on polyisocyanides, that we crosslinked selectively inside the bundles. This approach allows us to lock in the fibrous network present at the crosslinking conditions. At minimum crosslink densities, we are able to freeze in the architecture, as well as the associated mechanical properties. Rheology and Xray scattering experiments show that we able to accurately tailor network mechanics, not by changing the gel composition or architecture, but rather by tuning its (thermal) history. Selective crosslinking is a crucial step in making biomimetic networks with a controlled architecture. Unlike synthetic hydrogels, biological gels are made of fibrous networks which give rise to unique properties, such as high porosity and mechanical responsiveness. Here the authors use polyisocyanidebased gels and selectively crosslink inside the bundles to lock the fibrous network and thus control the architecture and the mechanics.",Daniel C.

These synergistic activities facilitate the beneficial effects of dietary flavonoids on cardiometabolic health parameters. The aims of this study were to investigate whether isoquercetin (a major dietary flavonoid) and inulin (soluble fibre), either alone or in combination could improve features of the metabolic syndrome. Following a 1 week acclimatization, male C57BL6 mice (68 weeks) were randomly assigned to; (i) normal chow diet (n  10), (ii) high fat (HF) diet (n  10), (iii) HF diet  0.05% isoquercetin (n  10), (iv) HF diet  5% inulin, or (v) HF diet  0.05% isoquercetin  5% inulin (n  10). Body weight and food intake were measured weekly. At 12 weeks, glucose and insulin tolerance tests were performed, and blood, faecal samples, liver, skeletal muscle and adipose tissue were collected. At 12 weeks, mice on the HF diet had significantly elevated body weights as well as impaired glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity compared to the normal chow mice. Supplementation with either isoquercetin or inulin had no effect, however mice receiving the combination had attenuated weight gain, improved glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity, reduced hepatic lipid accumulation, adipocyte hypertrophy, circulating leptin and adipose FGF21 levels, compared to mice receiving the HF diet. Additionally, mice on the combination diet had improvements in the composition and functionality of their gut microbiome as well as production of short chain fatty acids. In conclusion, longterm supplementation with the dietary flavonoid isoquercetin and the soluble fibre inulin can attenuate development of the metabolic syndrome in mice fed a high fat diet.

Here, we show that social relationships transform local interactions and collective dynamics. We tracked individuals' threedimensional trajectories within flocks of jackdaws, a species that forms lifelong pairbonds. Reflecting this social system, we find that flocks contain internal substructure, with discrete pairs of individuals tied together by springlike effective forces. Within flocks, paired birds interacted with fewer neighbours than unpaired birds and flapped their wings more slowly, which may result in energy savings. However, flocks with more paired birds had shorter correlation lengths, which is likely to inhibit efficient information transfer through the flock. Similar changes to group properties emerge naturally from a generic selfpropelled particle model. These results reveal a critical tension between individual and grouplevel benefits during collective behaviour in species with differentiated social relationships, and have major evolutionary and cognitive implications. Interactions between members of a group may be influenced by their social relationships. Here, the authors track individuals' trajectories within flocks of jackdaws and show that their social relationships transform local interactions and collective dynamics.",Hangjian Ling; Guillam E.

These forces often cause largescale asymmetric movements of the embryonic tissue2,3. In many embryos, the gastrulating tissue is surrounded by a rigid protective shell4. Although it is wellrecognized that gastrulation movements depend on forces that are generated by tissueintrinsic contractility5,6, it is not known whether interactions between the tissue and the protective shell provide additional forces that affect gastrulation. Here we show that a particular part of the blastoderm tissue of the red flour beetle (Tribolium castaneum) tightly adheres in a temporally coordinated manner to the vitelline envelope that surrounds the embryo. This attachment generates an additional force that counteracts tissueintrinsic contractile forces to create asymmetric tissue movements. This localized attachment depends on an PS2 integrin (inflated), and the knockdown of this integrin leads to a gastrulation phenotype that is consistent with complete loss of attachment. Furthermore, analysis of another integrin (the PS3 integrin, scab) in the fruit fly (Drosophila melanogaster) suggests that gastrulation in this organism also relies on adhesion between the blastoderm and the vitelline envelope. Our findings reveal a conserved mechanism through which the spatiotemporal pattern of tissue adhesion to the vitelline envelope provides controllable, counteracting forces that shape gastrulation movements in insects. In the red flour beetle (Tribolium castaneum) and fruit fly (Drosophila melanogaster), spatiotemporally coordinated integrindependent attachments between the blastoderm and vitelline envelope counteract tissueintrinsic contractile forces to create asymmetric movements of embryonic tissue.",Stefan Munster; Akanksha Jain; Alexander Mietke; Anastasios Pavlopoulos; Stephan W.

bfe4cbe7d8154f1cb479502fd5d4323e,The hepcidinferroportin axis controls the iron content of Salmonella containing vacuoles in macrophages,"Macrophages release iron into the bloodstream via a membranebound iron export protein, ferroportin (FPN). The hepatic ironregulatory hormone hepcidin controls FPN internalization and degradation in response to bacterial infection. Salmonella typhimurium can invade macrophages and proliferate in the Salmonellacontaining vacuole (SCV). Hepcidin is reported to increase the mortality of Salmonellainfected animals by increasing the bacterial load in macrophages. Here we assess the iron levels and find that hepcidin increases iron content in the cytosol but decreases it in the SCV through FPN on the SCV membrane. LossofFPN from the SCV via the action of hepcidin impairs the generation of bactericidal reactive oxygen species (ROS) as the iron content decreases. We conclude that FPN is required to provide sufficient iron to the SCV, where iron serves as a cofactor for the generation of antimicrobial ROS rather than as a nutrient for Salmonella. The effects of iron on vacuoleresident Salmonella in macrophages are unclear. Here the authors show that the bacteria are not subject to nutritional inhibition by iron deprivation, but that iron depletion in the vacuole, via the hepcidinferroportin axis, inhibits the bactericidal effect of oxidative burst.",Daejin Lim; Kwang Soo Kim; JaeHo Jeong; Oriana Marques; HyunJu kim; Miryoung Song; TaeHoon Lee; Jae Il Kim; HuengSik Choi; JungJoon Min; Dirk Bumann; Martina U.

To develop effective treatments, the mechanisms by which amphetamine produces its abuserelated effects need to be fully understood. It is well known that amphetamine exerts its actions by targeting highaffinity transporters for monoamines, in particular the cocainesensitive dopamine transporter. Organic cation transporter 3 (OCT3) has recently been found to play an important role in regulating monoamine signaling. However, whether OCT3 contributes to the actions of amphetamine is unclear. We found that OCT3 is expressed in dopamine neurons. Then, applying a combination of in vivo, ex vivo, and in vitro approaches, we revealed that a substantial component of amphetamine's actions is OCT3dependent and cocaine insensitive.

Central to this is the formation of the interhaemal membrane, a multicellular lamina facilitating exchange of oxygen, nutrients and metabolic waste products between the mother and fetus. In rodents, this cellular barrier contains two transporting layers of syncytiotrophoblast, which are multinucleated cells that form by cellcell fusion. Previously, we reported the expression of the GPIlinked cell surface protein LY6E by the syncytial layer closest to the maternal sinusoids of the mouse placenta (syncytiotrophoblast layer I). LY6E has since been shown to be a putative receptor for the fusogenic protein responsible for fusion of syncytiotrophoblast layer I, Syncytin A. In this report, we demonstrate that LY6E is essential for the normal fusion of syncytiotrophoblast layer I, and for the proper morphogenesis of both fetal and maternal vasculatures within the placenta. Furthermore, specific inactivation of Ly6e in the epiblast, but not in placenta, is compatible with embryonic development, indicating the embryonic lethality reported for Ly6e embryos is most likely placental in origin.",Michael B.

Generation of multi GHz and higher repetitionrate optical pulse trains directly from modelocked oscillators is often challenging. As an alternative, harmonic injection locking can be applied for extracavity repetitionrate multiplication (RRM). Here we have investigated the operation conditions and achievable performances of allfibre, highly tunable harmonic injection lockingbased pulse RRM. We show that, with slight tuning of slave laser length, highly tunable RRM is possible from a multiplication factor of 2 to 100. The resulting maximum SMSR is 41 dB when multiplied by a factor of two. We further characterize the noise properties of the multiplied signal in terms of phase noise and relative intensity noise. The resulting absolute rms timing jitter of the multiplied signal is in the range of 20 fs to 60 fs (10 kHz1MHz) for different multiplication factors. With its high tunability, simple and robust allfibre implementation, and low excess noise, the demonstrated RRM system may find diverse applications in microwave photonics, optical communications, photonic analoguetodigital conversion, and clock distribution networks.",ChanGi Jeon; Shuangyou Zhang; Junho Shin; Jungwon Kim,Frequency combs; Microwave photonics; Ultrafast lasers,"School of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST), Daejeon, Korea; School of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST), Daejeon, Korea; School of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST), Daejeon, Korea; School of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST), Daejeon, Korea"
f6beee6d848f43a4973cb5f17e1e85f5,Weighing the benefits of expanding protected areas versus managing existing ones,"Protected areas are a fundamental mechanism for conserving global biodiversity. Given limited conservation funds and shortfalls in funding for existing protected area management needs, a critical question is: should countries and states spend new funds on purchasing more land or managing existing protected areas to an acceptable standard? We used a nonspatial dynamic landscape model to compare the relative importance of expansion of protected areas versus improved protected area management in diverse contexts. We provide guidance on how to allocate funding across these two actions, and the order in which these actions should be prioritized. We discover that, in contrast with spending patterns, which focus on expansion rather than management, management is often the better first investment. The relative priority of expansion and management is determined by observable factors: the relative costs of the two actions and rates of degradation in protected and unprotected areas. Importantly, regardless of these factors, the final recommended action is always to split the budget across expansion and management such that there is adequate money for management. This highlights that, while our existing protected areas are an important asset, increased investment in management is essential to maximize their potential to protect biodiversity. Protected areas are vital for conserving biodiversity, but limited funds must be allocated between acquiring new areas and managing existing ones. Using a landscape model, this study finds that management is often the better first investment and is always a necessary complement to acquisition.",Vanessa M. Adams; Gwenllian D. Iacona; Hugh P.

Local vent communities are linked by pelagic larval dispersal and form regional metacommunities, nested within a number of biogeographic provinces. Larval supply depends on the connectivity of the dispersal networks, and affects recoverability of communities from disturbances. However, it is unclear how the dispersal networks contribute to recoverability of local communities. Here, we integrated a population dynamics model and estimation of large scale dispersal networks. By simulating disturbances to vent fields, we mapped recoverability of communities in 131 hydrothermal vent fields in the western Pacific Ocean. Our analysis showed substantial variation in recovery time due to variation in regional connectivity between known vent fields, and was not qualitatively affected by potential larval recruitment from unknown vent fields. In certain cases, simultaneous disturbance of a series of vent fields either delayed or wholly prevented recovery. Our approach is applicable to a dispersal network estimated from genetic diversity. Our method not only reveals distribution of recoverability of chemosynthetic communities in hydrothermal vent fields, but is also a practical tool for planning conservation strategies.",Kenta Suzuki; Katsuhiko Yoshida; Hiromi Watanabe; Hiroyuki Yamamoto,Conservation biology; Ecological modelling; Ecology; Population dynamics,"Center for Environmental Biology and Ecosystem Studies, National Institute for Environmental Studies, Tsukuba, Japan; Center for Environmental Biology and Ecosystem Studies, National Institute for Environmental Studies, Tsukuba, Japan; Research and Development (RD) Center for Submarine Resources, Japan Agency for MarineEarth Science and Technology, Yokosuka, Japan; Research and Development (RD) Center for Submarine Resources, Japan Agency for MarineEarth Science and Technology, Yokosuka, Japan"
57fd58e75def46d28f04e621c9163867,Cutaneous neurofibromas in the genomics era: current understanding and open questions,"Cutaneous neurofibromas (cNF) are a nearly ubiquitous symptom of neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), a disorder with a broad phenotypic spectrum caused by germline mutation of the neurofibromatosis type 1 tumour suppressor gene (NF1). Symptoms of NF1 can include learning disabilities, bone abnormalities and predisposition to tumours such as cNFs, plexiform neurofibromas, malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumours and optic nerve tumours. There are no therapies currently approved for cNFs aside from elective surgery, and the molecular aetiology of cNF remains relatively uncharacterised. Furthermore, whereas the biallelic inactivation of NF1 in neoplastic Schwann cells is critical for cNF formation, it is still unclear which additional genetic, transcriptional, epigenetic, microenvironmental or endocrine changes are important. Significant inroads have been made into cNF understanding, including NF1 genotypephenotype correlations in NF1 microdeletion patients, the identification of recurring somatic mutations, studies of cNFinvading mast cells and macrophages, and clinical trials of putative therapeutic targets such as mTOR, MEK and cKIT. Despite these advances, several gaps remain in our knowledge of the associated pathogenesis, which is further hampered by a lack of translationally relevant animal models. Some of these questions may be addressed in part by the adoption of genomic analysis techniques. Understanding the aetiology of cNF at the genomic level may assist in the development of new therapies for cNF, and may also contribute to a greater understanding of NF1RAS signalling in cancers beyond those associated with NF1. Here, we summarise the present understanding of cNF biology, including the pathogenesis, mutational landscape, contribution of the tumour microenvironment and endocrine signalling, and the historical and current state of clinical trials for cNF. We also highlight open access data resources and potential avenues for future research that leverage recently developed genomicsbased methods in cancer research.",Robert J. Allaway; Sara J. C.

0d796876fcdc4e4d937c9bfa390648bc,The SIAH2NRF1 axis spatially regulates tumor microenvironment remodeling for tumor progression,"The interactions between tumor cells with their microenvironments, including hypoxia, acidosis and immune cells, lead to the tumor heterogeneity which promotes tumor progression. Here, we show that SIAH2NRF1 axis remodels tumor microenvironment through regulating tumor mitochondrial function, tumorassociated macrophages (TAMs) polarization and cell death for tumor maintenance and progression. Mechanistically, low mitochondrial gene expression in breast cancers is associated with a poor clinical outcome. The hypoxiaactivated E3 ligase SIAH2 spatially downregulates nuclearencoded mitochondrial gene expression including pyruvate dehydrogenase beta via degrading NRF1 (Nuclear Respiratory Factor 1) through ubiquitination on lysine 230, resulting in enhanced Warburg effect, metabolic reprogramming and protumor immune response. Dampening NRF1 degradation under hypoxia not only impairs the polarization of TAMs, but also promotes tumor cells to become more susceptible to apoptosis in a FADDdependent fashion, resulting in secondary necrosis due to the impairment of efferocytosis. These data represent that inhibition of NRF1 degradation is a potential therapeutic strategy against cancer. Tumor cellmicroenvironment interactions generate heterogeneity and promote progression. Here, Ma et al. show that the E3 ligase SIAH2 degrades NRF1 in response to hypoxia to enhance protumor metabolic and environmental effects, whereas NRF1 stabilization sensitizes tumor cells to apoptosis.",Biao Ma; Hongcheng Cheng; Chenglong Mu; Guangfeng Geng; Tian Zhao; Qian Luo; Kaili Ma; Rui Chang; Qiangqiang Liu; Ruize Gao; Junli Nie; Jiaying Xie; Jinxue Han; Linbo Chen; Gui Ma; Yushan Zhu; Quan Chen,Cancer microenvironment; Cell signalling; Mitochondria; Tumour heterogeneity,"State Key Laboratory of Medicinal Chemical Biology, Tianjin Key Laboratory of Protein Sciences, College of Life Sciences, Nankai University, Tianjin, China; State Key Laboratory of Medicinal Chemical Biology, Tianjin Key Laboratory of Protein Sciences, College of Life Sciences, Nankai University, Tianjin, China; State Key Laboratory of Medicinal Chemical Biology, Tianjin Key Laboratory of Protein Sciences, College of Life Sciences, Nankai University, Tianjin, China; State Key Laboratory of Medicinal Chemical Biology, Tianjin Key Laboratory of Protein Sciences, College of Life Sciences, Nankai University, Tianjin, China; State Key Laboratory of Medicinal Chemical Biology, Tianjin Key Laboratory of Protein Sciences, College of Life Sciences, Nankai University, Tianjin, China; State Key Laboratory of Medicinal Chemical Biology, Tianjin Key Laboratory of Protein Sciences, College of Life Sciences, Nankai University, Tianjin, China; State Key Laboratory of Medicinal Chemical Biology, Tianjin Key Laboratory of Protein Sciences, College of Life Sciences, Nankai University, Tianjin, China; State Key Laboratory of Medicinal Chemical Biology, Tianjin Key Laboratory of Protein Sciences, College of Life Sciences, Nankai University, Tianjin, China; State Key Laboratory of Medicinal Chemical Biology, Tianjin Key Laboratory of Protein Sciences, College of Life Sciences, Nankai University, Tianjin, China; State Key Laboratory of Medicinal Chemical Biology, Tianjin Key Laboratory of Protein Sciences, College of Life Sciences, Nankai University, Tianjin, China; State Key Laboratory of Medicinal Chemical Biology, Tianjin Key Laboratory of Protein Sciences, College of Life Sciences, Nankai University, Tianjin, China; State Key Laboratory of Medicinal Chemical Biology, Tianjin Key Laboratory of Protein Sciences, College of Life Sciences, Nankai University, Tianjin, China; State Key Laboratory of Medicinal Chemical Biology, Tianjin Key Laboratory of Protein Sciences, College of Life Sciences, Nankai University, Tianjin, China; State Key Laboratory of Medicinal Chemical Biology, Tianjin Key Laboratory of Protein Sciences, College of Life Sciences, Nankai University, Tianjin, China; State Key Laboratory of Medicinal Chemical Biology, Tianjin Key Laboratory of Protein Sciences, College of Life Sciences, Nankai University, Tianjin, China; State Key Laboratory of Medicinal Chemical Biology, Tianjin Key Laboratory of Protein Sciences, College of Life Sciences, Nankai University, Tianjin, China; State Key Laboratory of Medicinal Chemical Biology, Tianjin Key Laboratory of Protein Sciences, College of Life Sciences, Nankai University, Tianjin, China; State Key Laboratory of Membrane Biology, Institute of Zoology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China"
ba394d95375242ab9cf71d9f3d4f0520,The LXR623induced long noncoding RNA LINC01125 suppresses the proliferation of breast cancer cells via PTENAKTp53 signaling pathway,"LXR623 (WAY252623), a liver X receptor agonist, reduces atherosclerotic plaque progression and remarkably inhibits the proliferation of glioblastoma cells, owing to its brainpenetrant ability. However, the role of LXR623 against the proliferation of other cancer cells and the underlying mechanism remain unknown. Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) serve as novel and crucial regulators that participate in cancer tumorigenesis and diverse biological processes. Here, we report a previously uncharacterized mechanism underlying lncRNAmediated exocytosis of LXR623 via the phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN)protein kinase B (AKT)p53 axis to suppress the proliferation of cancer cells in vitro. We found that LXR623 significantly inhibited the proliferation and induced apoptosis and cell cycle arrest at S phase in breast cancer cells in a concentration and timedependent manner. Experiments using a xenograft mouse model revealed the inhibitory effects of LXR623 on tumor growth. We used lncRNA microarray to investigate the potential genes regulated by LXR623. As a result, LINC01125 was found to be significantly upregulated in the cells treated with LXR623. Gain and lossoffunction assays were conducted to investigate the antiproliferation role of LINC01125. LINC01125 knockdown resulted in the inhibition of the cytotoxic effect of LXR623; in contrast, LINC01125 overexpression significantly enhanced the effect of LXR623. LXR623 and LINC01125mediated antigrowth regulation is, at least in part, associated with the participation of the PTENAKTmouse double minute 2 homolog (MDM2)p53 pathway. In addition, SF1670, a specific PTEN inhibitor with prolonged intracellular retention, may strongly block the antiproliferation effect induced by LXR623 and LINC01125 overexpression. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay results suggest that p53 binds to the promoter of LINC01125 to strengthen the expression of the PTENAKT pathway. Taken together, our findings suggest that LXR623 possesses significant antitumor activity in breast cancer cells that is partly mediated through the upregulation in LINC01125 expression and enhancement in apoptosis via the PTENAKTMDM2p53 pathway.",Weijun Wan; Yongying Hou; Ke Wang; Yue Cheng; Xia Pu; Xiufeng Ye,Breast cancer; Drug development; Tumour biomarkers,"Department of Pathology, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, China; Department of Pathology, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, China; Department of Pathology, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, China; Department of Pathology, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, China; Department of Pathology, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, China; Department of Pathology, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, China"
eae796f807ac43db911b0311ed995db9,A 60Myr record of continental backarc differentiation through cyclic melting,"Continental crust forms and evolves above subduction zones as a result of heat and mass transfer from the mantle below. The nature and extent of this transfer remain debated. Although it has been recognized that arc magmatism at active continental margins can be cyclical at 50 to 1Myr timescales, such cyclicity has not been recognized in the backarc. Here we investigate the melting of sedimentary rocks in the continental backarc of the western Gondwana margin during the CambrianOrdovician Famatinian orogeny of Northwest Argentina. We determine the UPb ages of zircons that formed during crustal melting and find that they range from 505 to 440 million years ago, concentrated into age groups spaced by 1015 Myr. This suggests multiple and cyclical melting events in the continental backarc, which matches the more than 60 Myr duration of the magmatic activity in the arc and demonstrates that thermal and magmatic cyclicity also extends to the continental hinterland. We conclude that backarc melting reflects a longlasting, pulsating, cyclical heat transfer from mantle to crust that leads to thorough crustal reworking, transforming sedimentary rocks into crystalline continental crust. Thus, while magma transfer from the mantle promotes crustal growth in convergent margins, cyclical melting promotes crustal maturation of the backarc. Melting of sedimentary rocks in the continental backarc is cyclical with peaks of magmatism every 10 to 15 million years, according to zircon ages from Paleozoic western Gondwana margin samples.",Lauren C.

Here, we employed chronic mild social defeat stress and 16S rRNA gene metagenomic sequencing to investigate the role of microbial composition in mediating anxiety and depressivelike behavior. In socially defeated animals, we found significant reductions in the overall diversity and relative abundances of numerous bacterial genera, including Akkermansia spp., that positively correlated with behavioral metrics of both anxiety and depression. Functional analyses predicted a reduced frequency of signaling molecule pathways, including Gproteincoupled receptors, in defeated animals.

Bees have been observed foraging on mushroom mycelium, suggesting that they may be deriving medicinal or nutritional value from fungi. Fungi are known to produce a wide array of chemicals with antimicrobial activity, including compounds active against bacteria, other fungi, or viruses. We tested extracts from the mycelium of multiple polypore fungal species known to have antiviral properties. Extracts from amadou (Fomes) and reishi (Ganoderma) fungi reduced the levels of honey bee deformed wing virus (DWV) and Lake Sinai virus (LSV) in a dosedependent manner. In field trials, colonies fed Ganoderma resinaceum extract exhibited a 79fold reduction in DWV and a 45,000fold reduction in LSV compared to control colonies.

2068dbe5f1554e3496130cce99edace6,Clonal replacement and heterogeneity in breast tumors treated with neoadjuvant HER2targeted therapy,"Genomic changes observed across treatment may result from either clonal evolution or geographically disparate sampling of heterogeneous tumors. Here we use computational modeling based on analysis of fifteen primary breast tumors and find that apparent clonal change between two tumor samples can frequently be explained by pretreatment heterogeneity, such that at least two regions are necessary to detect treatmentinduced clonal shifts. To assess for clonal replacement, we devise a summary statistic based on wholeexome sequencing of a pretreatment biopsy and multiregion sampling of the posttreatment surgical specimen and apply this measure to five breast tumors treated with neoadjuvant HER2targeted therapy. Two tumors underwent clonal replacement with treatment, and mathematical modeling indicates these two tumors had resistant subclones prior to treatment and rates of resistancerelated genomic changes that were substantially larger than previous estimates. Our results provide a needed framework to incorporate primary tumor heterogeneity in investigating the evolution of resistance. When examining the evolution of treatment resistance in breast cancer, perceived genomic changes may be due to clonal evolution or heterogeneous tumors. Here, the authors show that apparent clonal change can in fact be due to pretreatment heterogeneity, and samples from at least two regions are necessary to detect treatmentinduced clonal shifts",Jennifer L.

269bd20588f147c3be2ed74f00deca28,Zika virus E protein alters the properties of human fetal neural stem cells by modulating microRNA circuitry,"Zika virus (ZV) infects neural stem cells (NSCs) and causes quiescence in NSCs, reducing the pool of brain cells, leading to microcephaly. Despite conscientious efforts, the molecular mechanisms for ZVmediated effects on NSCs lack clarity. This study aimed to explore the underlying mechanisms for ZVmediated induction of quiescence in the primary cultures of human fetal neural stem cells (fNSCs). We demonstrate that expression of ZV envelope (E) protein displays maximum quiescence in human fNSCs by accumulating cells in the G0G1 phase of the cell cycle as compared to other nonstructural proteins, viz. NS2A, NS4A and NS4B. E protein induces immature differentiation by induction of proneuronal genes in proliferating fNSCs, induces apoptosis in differentiating fNSCs 3 days post differentiation, and disrupts migration of cells from differentiating neurospheres. In utero electroporation of mouse brain with E protein shows drastic downregulation of proliferating cells in ventricular and subventricular zone regions. Global microRNA sequencing suggests that E protein modulates miRNA circuitry. Among differentially expressed miRNAs, we found 14 upregulated and 11 downregulated miRNAs. Mir2043p and mir1273g3p directly regulate NOTCH2 and PAX3 expression, respectively, by binding to their 3UTR. Bioinformatic analysis using GO analysis for the targets of differentially expressed miRNAs revealed enrichment of cell cycle and developmental processes. Furthermore, WNT, CCKR, PDGF, EGF, p53, and NOTCH signaling pathways were among the top enriched pathways. Thus, our study provides evidence for the involvement of ZV E protein and novel insights into the molecular mechanism through identification of miRNA circuitry.

As a clonally propagated crop, potato (Solanum tuberosum L.) suffers from severe inbreeding depression; however, the genetic basis of inbreeding depression in potato is largely unknown. To gain insight into inbreeding depression in potato, we evaluated the mutation burden in 151 diploid potatoes and obtained 344,831 predicted deleterious substitutions. The deleterious mutations in potato are enriched in the pericentromeric regions and are line specific. Using three F2 populations, we identified 15 genomic regions with severe segregation distortions due to selection at the gametic and zygotic stages. Most of the deleterious recessive alleles affecting survival and growth vigor were located in regions with high recombination rates. One of these deleterious alleles is derived from a rare mutation that disrupts a gene required for embryo development. This study provides the basis for genome design of potato inbred lines. Genomic analysis of 151 diploid potatoes and three potato populations produced by selfcrossing identifies 344,831 deleterious substitutions and 15 genomic regions with severe segregation distortions, providing the basis for genome design of potato inbred lines.",Chunzhi Zhang; Pei Wang; Die Tang; Zhongmin Yang; Fei Lu; Jianjian Qi; Nilesh R.

Currently, clinical LAsparaginase formulations are derived from bacterial sources such as Escherichia coli and Erwinia chrysanthemi. These formulations when administered to ALL patients lead to several immunological and hypersensitive reactions. Hence, additional purification steps are required to remove toxicity induced by the amalgamation of other enzymes like glutaminase and urease. Production of LAsparaginase that is free of glutaminase and urease is a major area of research. In this paper, we report the screening and isolation of fungal species collected from the soil and mosses in the Schirmacher Hills, Dronning Maud Land, Antarctica, that produce LAsparaginase free of glutaminase and urease. A total of 55 isolates were obtained from 33 environmental samples that were tested by conventional plate techniques using Phenol red and Bromothymol blue as indicators. Among the isolated fungi, 30 isolates showed LAsparaginase free of glutaminase and urease. The LAsparaginase producing strain Trichosporon asahii IBBLA1, which showed the highest zone index, was then optimized with a Taguchi design. Optimum enzyme activity of 20.57 U mL1 was obtained at a temperature of 30 C and pH of 7.0 after 60 hours.

Restoration of FBP1 expression in HCC cancer cells suppressed EMT phenotype, tumour migration and tumour growth induced by Snail overexpression in SMMC7721 cells. Gene set enrichment analyses revealed significantly enriched terms, including WNT, Notch, ESC, CSR and PDGF, in the group with high Snail and low FBP1 compared with those with low Snail and high FBP1. Low FBP1 expression was significantly correlated with higher AFP level, satellite nodules, portal vein tumour thrombus, and advanced tumour stage.

The Co3O4RGO nanocomposites displayed good electrochemical behavior as anodic materials for liion batteries when compared to pure Co3O4. The Co3O4RGO nanocomposites with low RGO content resulted in stable electrochemical performance with 100% coulombic efficiency at a high current density of 500 mAg for 50 cycles. The enhanced capacity of the Co3O4RGO nanocomposites is due to the incorporation of RGO, which resulted in a four times larger surface area than that of Co3O4. This increased surface area could facilitate the absorption of more lithium ions, resulting in excellent electrochemical performance.

Predicting the evolution of these quantities over multiple years to decades is a difficult task. Here, we estimate yearonyear volatility and unpredictability over multidecade time frames for many quantities in the US energy system using historical projections. We determine the distribution over time of the most extreme projection errors (unpredictability) from 1985 to 2014, and the largest yearoveryear changes (volatility) in the quantities themselves from 1949 to 2014. Our results show that both volatility and unpredictability have increased in the past decade, compared to the three and two decades before it. These findings may be useful for energy decisionmakers to consider as they invest in and regulate longlived energy infrastructure in a deeply uncertain world.

Previous studies have accumulated evidence supporting NMDARencoding genes' role in etiology of SCZ and ASD. We performed a screening study for exonic regions of GRIN1, GRIN2A, GRIN2C, GRIN2D, GRIN3A, and GRIN3B, which encode NMDAR subunits, in 562 participates (370 SCZ and 192 ASD). Forty rare variants were identified including 38 missense, 1 frameshift mutation in GRIN2C and 1 splice site mutation in GRIN2D. We conducted in silico analysis for all variants and detected seven missense variants with deleterious prediction. De novo analysis was conducted if pedigree samples were available. The splice site mutation in GRIN2D is predicted to result in intron retention by minigene assay.

0d90f4bfffc44eeabee65a1e38042e8d,CRISPRCas9mediated one step biallelic change of genomic DNA in iPSCs and human RPE cells in vitro with dual antibiotic selection,"CRISPRCas9 causes doublestranded DNA breaks that can undergo DNA repair either via nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ) or, in the presence of a template, homologydirected repair (HDR). HDR is typically used to insert a specific genetic modification into the genome but has low efficiency compared to NHEJ, which is lowered even further when trying to create a homozygous change. In this study we devised a novel approach for homozygous single base editing based on utilising simultaneously two donor DNA templates cloned in plasmids with different antibiotic resistant genes. The donor templates were cotransfected alongside the CRISPRCas9 machinery into cells and a double antibiotic selection was optimised and allowed the isolation of viable desired clones. We applied the method for obtaining isogenic cells homozygous for variant B cystatin C, a recessive risk factor for agerelated macular degeneration and Alzheimer's disease, in both induced Pluripotent Stem Cells (iPSCs) and a human RPE cell line. Biallelic gene edited clones were validated by sequencing, demonstrating that the double antibiotic templates approach worked efficiently for both iPSCs and human differentiated cells. We propose that this one step gene editing approach can be used to improve the specificity and frequency of introducing homozygous modifications in mammalian cells.",Wasu Supharattanasitthi; Emil Carlsson; Umar Sharif; Luminita Paraoan,Genetic models; Homologous recombination,"Department of Eye and Vision Science, Institute of Ageing and Chronic Disease, University of Liverpool, Liverpool, United Kingdom; Department of Physiology, Faculty of Pharmacy, Mahidol University, Bangkok, Thailand; Department of Eye and Vision Science, Institute of Ageing and Chronic Disease, University of Liverpool, Liverpool, United Kingdom; Department of Eye and Vision Science, Institute of Ageing and Chronic Disease, University of Liverpool, Liverpool, United Kingdom; Department of Eye and Vision Science, Institute of Ageing and Chronic Disease, University of Liverpool, Liverpool, United Kingdom"
9268f4a77fb04c929ab8cb09372fec2f,"PBK, targeted by EVI1, promotes metastasis and confers cisplatin resistance through inducing autophagy in highgrade serous ovarian carcinoma","Highgrade serous ovarian carcinoma (HGSOC) is the most lethal type of gynecologic malignancy. Chemoresistance is the main reason for the poor prognosis of HGSOC. PDZbinding kinase (PBK) promotes the malignant progression of various carcinomas. However, the roles and clinical significance of PBK in HGSOC remain unclear. Here, we reported that PBK was overexpressed in HGSOC tissues and cell lines. High PBK expression was associated with a poor prognosis, metastasis, and cisplatin resistance of HGSOC. Overexpression of PBK promoted autophagy and enhanced cisplatin resistance via the ERKmTOR signaling pathway. Further study showed that inhibition of autophagy by chloroquine or bafilomycin A1 reversed PBKinduced cisplatin resistance. Overexpression of PBK decreased ovarian cancer responsiveness to cisplatin treatment through inducing autophagy in vivo. We also demonstrated that the PBK inhibitor OTS514 augmented the growth inhibition effect of cisplatin in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, ecotropic viral integration site1 (EVI1) could regulate PBK expression through directly targeting the PBK promoter region. In conclusion, high PBK expression was correlated with a poor prognosis, metastasis, and cisplatin resistance through promoting autophagy in HGSOC.

With it comes the promise of big data technology enabling more resourceefficient urban systems and improved governance. Increasingly, however, this technocentric view is being challenged, at least rhetorically, by seeking to place people at the heart of smart city development. Yet, especially in the case of the UK, such development typically takes place within a governance context which marginalises established planning and decision processes, thus arguably weakening public accountability. Moreover, the norms of engagement change in that citizens are assigned more of an entrepreneurial role as coproducers of datadriven information. It becomes necessary, therefore, to reconsider, as well as reinvigorate the place of the public in the future city. This article seeks to do so by making the case, on one hand, for strengthening institutional frameworks and, on the other, advancing a more active role for citizens to become involved in actualising and scrutinising future cities.",Simon Joss,Geography; Politics and international relations,"Department of Politics and International Relations, University of Westminster, Westminster, England"

Growing evidence suggests that dysregulation of autophagy, a cellular mechanism essential for selfdigestion of damaged proteins and organelles, is involved in neurological degenerative diseases including AD. Previously, we reported that autophagosomes are increased in the brains of AD mouse model. However, the plasma levels of autophagic markers have not yet been investigated in patients with AD. In this study, we investigated the expression of autophagyrelated genes 5 and 12 (ATG5 and ATG12, respectively) in cells in vitro upon amyloidbeta (A) treatment and in the plasma of AD patients. ATG5ATG12 complex levels were increased in primary rat cortical neurons and human umbilical vein endothelial cells after A treatment. Furthermore, we compared plasma from 69 patients with dementia, 82 patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and 127 cognitively normal control participants. Plasma levels of ATG5 were significantly elevated in patients with dementia (149.3  7.5 ngmL) or MCI (152.9  6.9 ngmL) compared with the control subjects (129.0  4.1 ngmL) (p  0.034, p  0.016, respectively).

Patients with these highrisk cytogenetic abnormalities, as well as those who are elderly and transplant ineligible, have not experienced the same degree of improved survival outcomes that other patients have seen with recent advances in the treatment of multiple myeloma. To date, no treatment regimen has demonstrated sustained and consistent survival benefits in elderly, transplantineligible patients with highrisk cytogenetic abnormalities and newly diagnosed multiple myeloma. Thus, there is an unmet need to identify effective treatment options for these patients and achieve outcomes parity with standardrisk patients. In this review, we assessed clinical trials of both doublet and triplet regimens for newly diagnosed multiple myeloma that included elderly, transplantineligible patients with highrisk cytogenetic abnormalities and that provided outcomes data stratified by cytogenetic risk status. We concluded that regimens containing an IMiD agent as the foundation of therapy, combined with agents that have synergistic mechanisms of actionincluding novel therapiesmay in future investigations help overcome the poor prognosis of highrisk cytogenetic abnormalities in this vulnerable patient population.",Herve AvetLoiseau; Thierry Facon,Cancer therapy; Cytogenetics; Myeloma,"Unite de Genomique du Myelome, CHU Rangueil, Toulouse, France; Service des Maladies du Sang, Hopital Claude Huriez, Lille, France"

An important part of this process is the phagosomal transport from the cell periphery to the perinuclear region. Biochemical factors are known to influence the fate of phagosomes. Here, we show that the size of phagosomes also has a strong influence on their transport. We found that large phagosomes are transported persistently to the nucleus, whereas small phagosomes show strong bidirectional transport. We show that dynein motors play a larger role in the transport of large phagosomes, whereas actin filamentbased motility plays a larger role in the transport of small phagosomes. Furthermore, we investigated the spatial distribution of dyneins and microtubules around phagosomes and hypothesize that dynein and microtubule density differences between the nucleusfacing side of phagosomes and the opposite side could explain part of the observed transport characteristics.

Although they had uniform amylose (AM) content, the five jackfruit starches displayed different physicochemical properties, including their pasting, thermal, crystal and texture properties. Furthermore, differences in the molecular structure (i.e., average weightaverage molar mass (Mw) of amylose and amylopectin (AP) as well as the same AP fine structure) were also found in the five jackfruit starches. The results indicated that jackfruit starch with a larger Mw of amylose and proportions of DP 2536, DP  37 and chain length had a lower peak viscosity, breakdown, final viscosity, setback and adhesiveness, but a higher pasting and gelatinization temperature, gelatinization temperature range, gelatinization enthalpy and relative crystallinity. Xiangyinsuo 1 hao (X1) starch, which originated from Xinglong in Hainan province, China, had special physicochemical properties, which were ascribed to its lower amylopectin Mw, smaller particle size, and perfect amylopectin structure.

We now show that when reconstituted into large unilamellar vesicles, purified BR trimers exhibit lightindependent lipid scramblase activity, thereby facilitating transbilayer exchange of phospholipids between the leaflets of the vesicle membrane at a rate 10,000 per trimer per second. This activity is comparable to that of recently described scramblases including bovine rhodopsin and fungal TMEM16 proteins. Specificity tests reveal that BR scrambles fluorescent analogues of common phospholipids but does not transport a glycosylated diphosphate isoprenoid lipid. In silico analyses suggest that membraneexposed polar residues in transmembrane helices 1 and 2 of BR may provide the molecular basis for lipid translocation by coordinating the polar headgroups of transiting phospholipids. Consistent with this possibility, extensive coarsegrained molecular dynamics simulations of a BR trimer in an explicit phospholipid membrane revealed water penetration along transmembrane helix 1 with the cooperation of a polar residue (Y147 in transmembrane helix 5) in the adjacent protomer. These results suggest that the lipid translocation pathway may lie at or near the interface of the protomers of a BR trimer.",Alice Verchere; WeiLin Ou; Birgit Ploier; Takefumi Morizumi; Michael A.

Arion vulgaris (syn. lusitanicus) is a major agricultural pest slug that successfully invaded many European countries in recent decades, but its impact on closely related native species remains unclear. Here, we hypothesized that the regional decline of native A. rufus is connected with the spread of invasive A. vulgaris, and tested whether this can be linked to hybridization between the two species by analyzing 625 Arion sp. along altitudinal transects in three regions in Switzerland. In each region, we observed clear evidence of different degrees of genetic admixture, suggesting recurrent hybridization beyond the first generation. We found spatial differences in admixture patterns that might reflect distinct invasion histories among the regions. Our analyses provide a landscape level perspective for the genetic interactions between invasive and native animals during the invasion. We predict that without specific management action, A. vulgaris will further expand its range, which might lead to local extinction of A. rufus and other native slugs in the near future.

Herein, by using paired normal and prostate cancerassociated stromal fibroblasts (CAFs) derived from a coculture cell model and clinical patient samples, we demonstrated that although CAFs promoted prostate cancer growth, matrix metalloproteinase3 (MMP3) was lower in CAFs but elevated in prostate cancer cells relative to their normal counterparts. Furthermore, hydrogen peroxide was characterized as the central modulator for altered MMP3 expression in prostate cancer cells and CAFs, but through different regulatory mechanisms. Treatment of CAFs but not prostate cancer cells with hydrogen peroxide directly inhibited mmp3 promoter activity with concomitant nuclear translocation of nuclear factorB (NFB), indicating that NFB is the downstream pathway for the transcriptional repression of MMP3 in CAFs. Hydrogen peroxide reduced thrombospondin 2 (an MMP3 suppressor) expression in prostate cancer cells by upregulating microRNA128.

This study investigated the in vitro and in vivo anticancer properties of CoQ0 on human ovarian carcinoma (SKOV3) cells and xenografted nude mice, and revealed the underlying molecular mechanism. CoQ0 induced G2M arrest through downregulation of cyclin B1A and CDK1K2 expressions. CoQ0induced autophagy as a survival mechanism was evidenced by increased accumulation of LC3II, GFPLC3 puncta, AVOs formation and Beclin1Bcl2 dysregulation. Increased TUNELpositive cells and AnnexinVPI stained cells indicated CoQ0induced late apoptosis. Both mitochondrial (caspase3, PARP and BaxBcl2 dysregulation) and ER stress (caspase12 and Hsp70) signals are involved in execution of apoptosis. Interestingly, CoQ0induced apoptosisautophagy is associated with suppression of HER2neu and PI3KAKT signalling cascades. CoQ0 triggered intracellular ROS production, whereas antioxidant Nacetylcysteine prevented CoQ0induced apoptosis, but not autophagy. Inhibition of apoptosis by ZVADFMK suppressed CoQ0induced autophagy (diminished LC3IIAVOs), indicates CoQ0induced apoptosis led to evoke autophagy.

We used a model heterostructure consisting of an elliptical ultrathin amorphous Co20Fe60B20 on top of a polycrystalline Pb(Zr,Ti)O3 (PZT) thin film. We constructed a diagram showing the speed of perpendicular magnetization reversal as a function of the amplitude of the applied voltage pulse and the stiffness damping coefficient of PZT film. In addition, we investigated the influence of thermal fluctuations on the switching speed. The analyses suggest that the switching time remains well below 10 ns and that the energy dissipation per switching is on the order of femtojoule. The present computational analyses can be generally used to predict the speed of piezostrainenabled magnetization switching and magnetic domainwall motion, which critically determines the response time of corresponding piezostrainenabled spintronic and magnonic devices. Mechanically controlling the magnetic properties of a material can be achieved in nanoseconds. The ability to alter the magnetic properties of a material without using a magnetic field could enable lowpower electronic devices. This can be done by combining a magnetic material with a piezoelectric material  one that expands or contracts when subjected to an electric field  since the mechanical force modifies the properties of the magnetic material. JiaMian Hu from Pennsylvania State University and coworkers have shown that such changes can occur much faster than expected. They computationally analysed a combination of magnetic cobalt iron boron and piezoelectric lead zirconate titanate and demonstrated that such changes can occur in less than 10 nanoseconds. Their analysis will be useful for determining the response times of spintronic and magnonic devices that employ piezoelectric materials. Piezostrainenabled magnetization switching in magneticpiezoelectric heterostructures consists of multiple coupled kinetic processes that have rarely been considered together, thus an accurate computational analysis on the switching speed has remained outstanding. Here a computational approach is developed to accurately analyze the speed of such piezostrainenabled magnetization switching by linking local elastodynamics in the piezoelectric to local magnetization dynamics in the magnet. For example, the approach is utilized to analyze the speed of a recently proposed scheme of piezostrainenabled 180 perpendicular magnetization switching, where the overall switching time is shown to be below 10 ns in a model CoFeBPb(Zr,Ti)O3 heterostructure.

However, to what extent the variations in CAG repeat length in the other eight polyglutamine diseaseassociated genes (PDAGs) are associated with depression is still unknown. We determined the CAG repeat sizes of ATXN1, ATXN2, ATXN3, CACNA1A, ATXN7, TBP, ATN1 and AR in two wellcharacterized Dutch cohortsthe Netherlands Study of Depression and Anxiety and the Netherlands Study of Depression in Older Personsincluding 2165 depressed and 1058 nondepressed individualsaged 1893 years. The association between PDAG CAG repeat size and the risk for depression was assessed via binary logistic regression. We found that the odds ratio (OR) for lifetime depression was significantly higher for individuals with 10, compared with subjects with 10, CAG repeats in both ATXN7 alleles (OR1.90, confidence interval (CI) 1.262.85). For TBP we found a similar association: A CAG repeat length exceeding the median in both alleles was associated with an increased risk for lifetime depression (OR1.33, CI 1.001.76). In conclusion, we observed that carriers of either ATXN7 or TBP alleles with relatively large CAG repeat sizes in both alleles had a substantially increased risk of lifetime depression. Our findings provide critical evidence for the notion that repeat polymorphisms can act as complex genetic modifiers of depression.",S L Gardiner; M J van Belzen; M W Boogaard; W M C van RoonMom; M P Rozing; A M van Hemert; J H Smit; A T F Beekman; G van Grootheest; R A Schoevers; R C Oude Voshaar; H C Comijs; B W J H Penninx; R C van der Mast; R A C Roos; N A Aziz,Clinical genetics; Depression; Molecular neuroscience,"Department of Neurology, Leiden University Medical Centre, Leiden, The Netherlands; Department of Human Genetics, Leiden University Medical Centre, Leiden, The Netherlands; Department of Clinical Genetics, Leiden University Medical Centre, Leiden, The Netherlands; Department of Neurology, Leiden University Medical Centre, Leiden, The Netherlands; Department of Clinical Genetics, Leiden University Medical Centre, Leiden, The Netherlands; Department of Human Genetics, Leiden University Medical Centre, Leiden, The Netherlands; Centre for Healthy AgeingDepartment of Public Health, Section of Social Medicine, University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark; Department of Psychiatry, Leiden University Medical Centre, Leiden, The Netherlands; Department of Psychiatry, Amsterdam Public Health Research Institute and Neuroscience Campus Amsterdam, VU University Medical CentreGGZ inGeest, Amsterdam, The Netherlands; Department of Psychiatry, Amsterdam Public Health Research Institute and Neuroscience Campus Amsterdam, VU University Medical CentreGGZ inGeest, Amsterdam, The Netherlands; Department of Psychiatry, Amsterdam Public Health Research Institute and Neuroscience Campus Amsterdam, VU University Medical CentreGGZ inGeest, Amsterdam, The Netherlands; Department of Psychiatry, University of Groningen, University Medical Centre Groningen, Research School Cognitive Behavioural Neuroscience, Groningen, The Netherlands; Department of Psychiatry, University of Groningen, University Medical Centre Groningen, Research School Cognitive Behavioural Neuroscience, Groningen, The Netherlands; Department of Psychiatry, Amsterdam Public Health Research Institute and Neuroscience Campus Amsterdam, VU University Medical CentreGGZ inGeest, Amsterdam, The Netherlands; Department of Psychiatry, Amsterdam Public Health Research Institute and Neuroscience Campus Amsterdam, VU University Medical CentreGGZ inGeest, Amsterdam, The Netherlands; Department of Psychiatry, Leiden University Medical Centre, Leiden, The Netherlands; Department of Psychiatry, Collaborative Antwerp Psychiatric Research Institute (CAPRI), University of Antwerp, Antwerp, Belgium; Department of Neurology, Leiden University Medical Centre, Leiden, The Netherlands; Department of Neurology, Leiden University Medical Centre, Leiden, The Netherlands"

The 7 subunit, which is one of components of the  ring, is known to selfassemble into a doubleringed homotetradecamer composed of two layers of the 7 heptameric ring. The 7 tetradecamer is known to disassemble upon the addition of 6 subunit, producing a 1:7 heterooctameric 67 complex. However, the detailed disassembly mechanism remains unclear. Here, we applied highspeed atomic force microscopy (HSAFM) to dissect the disassembly process of the 7 double ring caused by interaction with the 6. HSAFM movies clearly demonstrated two different modes of interaction in which the 6 monomer initially cracks at the interface between the stacked two 7 single rings and the subsequent intercalation of the 6 monomer in the open pore of the 7 single ring blocks the reassociation of the single rings into the double ring. This result provides a mechanistic insight about the disassembly process of nonnative homooligomers formed by proteasome components which is crucial for the initial process for assembly of 20S proteasome.",Toshiya Kozai; Taichiro Sekiguchi; Tadashi Satoh; Hirokazu Yagi; Koichi Kato; Takayuki Uchihashi,Singlemolecule biophysics; Supramolecular assembly,"College of Science and Engineering, Kanazawa University, Kakuma, Kanazawa, Ishikawa, Japan; Faculty and Graduate School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Nagoya City University, 31 Tanabedori, Mizuhoku, Nagoya, Japan; Faculty and Graduate School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Nagoya City University, 31 Tanabedori, Mizuhoku, Nagoya, Japan; Faculty and Graduate School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Nagoya City University, 31 Tanabedori, Mizuhoku, Nagoya, Japan; Faculty and Graduate School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Nagoya City University, 31 Tanabedori, Mizuhoku, Nagoya, Japan; Okazaki Institute for Integrative Bioscience and Institute for Molecular Science, National Institutes of Natural Sciences, 51 Higashiyama, Myodaiji, Okazaki, Japan; Department of Physics, Nagoya University, Furocho, Chikusaku, Nagoya, Japan; CREST, JST (Japan Science and Technology), Kawaguchi, Saitama, Japan"

Erythroid and kidney AE1 play a major role in HCO3 and Cl exchange. Stomatins downregulate the activity of many channels and transporters. Biochemical studies suggested an interaction of erythroid AE1 with stomatin. Moreover, we previously reported normal AE1 expression level in stomatindeficient RBCs. Here, the ability of stomatin to modulate AE1dependent ClHCO3 exchange was evaluated using stoppedflow methods. In HEK293 cells expressing recombinant AE1 and stomatin, the permeabilities associated with AE1 activity were 30% higher in cells overexpressing stomatin, compared to cells with only endogenous stomatin expression. Ghosts from stomatindeficient RBCs and controls were resealed in the presence of pH or chloridesensitive fluorescent probes and submitted to inward HCO3 and outward Cl gradients. From alkalinization rate constants, we deduced a 47% decreased permeability to HCO3 for stomatindeficient patients. Similarly, kinetics of Cl efflux, followed by the probe dequenching, revealed a significant 42% decrease in patients. In situ Proximity Ligation Assays confirmed an interaction of AE1 with stomatin, in both HEK recombinant cells and RBCs.

However, the cumulative radiation induced in CT scan has raised extensive concerns in recently years. How to maintain reconstruction image quality is a major challenge for lowdose CT (LDCT) imaging. Generally, LDCT imaging can be greatly improved by incorporating prior knowledge in some specific forms. A joint estimation framework termed discriminative priorprior image constrained compressed sensing (DPPICCS) reconstruction is proposed in this paper. This DPPICCS algorithm utilizes discriminative prior knowledge via two feature dictionary constraints which built on atoms from the samples of tissue attenuation feature patches and noiseartifacts residual feature patches, respectively. Also, the prior image construction relies on a discriminative feature representation (DFR) processing by two feature dictionary. Its comparison to other competing methods through experiments on lowdose projections acquired from torso phantom simulation study and clinical abdomen study demonstrated that the DPPICCS method achieved promising improvement in terms of the effectivelysuppressed noise and the wellretained structures.",Yang Chen; Jin Liu; Lizhe Xie; Yining Hu; Huazhong Shu; Limin Luo; Libo Zhang; Zhiguo Gui; Gouenou Coatrieux,Biomedical engineering; Computational science; Computer science,"Laboratory of Image Science and Technology, School of Computer Science and Engineering, Southeast University, Nanjing, China; Key Laboratory of Computer Network and Information Integration (Southeast University), Ministry of Education, Nanjing, China; International Joint Research Laboratory of Information Display and Visualization, Southeast University, Ministry of Education, Nanjing, China; Laboratory of Image Science and Technology, School of Computer Science and Engineering, Southeast University, Nanjing, China; Key Laboratory of Computer Network and Information Integration (Southeast University), Ministry of Education, Nanjing, China; International Joint Research Laboratory of Information Display and Visualization, Southeast University, Ministry of Education, Nanjing, China; Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Oral Diseases, Nanjing Medical University, No. 140, Hanzhong road, Nanjing, China; Laboratory of Image Science and Technology, School of Computer Science and Engineering, Southeast University, Nanjing, China; Key Laboratory of Computer Network and Information Integration (Southeast University), Ministry of Education, Nanjing, China; International Joint Research Laboratory of Information Display and Visualization, Southeast University, Ministry of Education, Nanjing, China; Laboratory of Image Science and Technology, School of Computer Science and Engineering, Southeast University, Nanjing, China; Key Laboratory of Computer Network and Information Integration (Southeast University), Ministry of Education, Nanjing, China; International Joint Research Laboratory of Information Display and Visualization, Southeast University, Ministry of Education, Nanjing, China; Laboratory of Image Science and Technology, School of Computer Science and Engineering, Southeast University, Nanjing, China; Key Laboratory of Computer Network and Information Integration (Southeast University), Ministry of Education, Nanjing, China; International Joint Research Laboratory of Information Display and Visualization, Southeast University, Ministry of Education, Nanjing, China; The General Hospital of Shenyang Military, Shenyang, China; The National Key Laboratory for Electronic Measurement Technology, North University of China, Taiyuan, China; The Institut MinesTelecom, Telecom Bretagne; INSERM U1101 LaTIM, Brest, France"

In the present study, the whole transcriptome microarray data were generated from peripheral blood mononuclear cells from Chinese children with acute infectious mononucleosis (AIM) and chronic active EBV infection (CAEBV) that were also compared with a publicly available microarray dataset from a study of American college students with AIM. Our study characterized for the first time a broad spectrum of molecular signatures in AIM and CAEBV. The key findings from the transcriptome profiling were validated with qPCR and flow cytometry assays. The most important finding in our study is the discovery of predominant  TCR expression and  T cell expansion in AIM. This finding, in combination with the striking upregulation of CD3, CD8 and CD94, suggests that CD8 T cells and CD94 NK cells may play a major role in AIM. Moreover, the unique upregulation of CD64AB and its significant correlation with the monocyte marker CD14 was observed in CAEBV and that implies an important role of monocytes in CAEBV.

It is involved in numerous processes including brain function and neuropathology, that require more than its strict proteolytic role. It consists of a sevenbladed propeller juxtaposed to a catalytic hydrolase domain. The conformational dynamics of PREP involved in domain motions and the gating mechanism that allows substrate accessibility remain elusive. Here we used Hydrogen Deuterium eXchange Mass Spectrometry (HDXMS) to derive the first nearresidue resolution analysis of global PREP dynamics in the presence or absence of inhibitor bound in the active site. Clear roles are revealed for parts that would be critical for the activation mechanism. In the free state, the interdomain interface is loose, providing access to the catalytic site. Inhibitor binding ""locks"" the two domains together exploiting prominent interactions between the loop of the first propeller blade and its proximal helix from the hydrolase domain. Loop A, thought to drive gating, is partially stabilized but remains flexible and dynamic. These findings provide a conformational guide for further dissection of the gating mechanism of PREP, that would impact drug development. Moreover, they offer a structural framework against which to study proteolysisindependent interactions with disordered proteins like synuclein involved in neurodegenerative disease.",Alexandra Tsirigotaki; Roos Van Elzen; Pieter Van Der Veken; AnneMarie Lambeir; Anastassios Economou,Mass spectrometry; Proteases; Protein quality control; Structural biology,"KU Leuven, Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Rega Institute, Laboratory of Molecular Bacteriology, Herestraat 49, Leuven, Belgium; Laboratory of Medical Biochemistry, Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Antwerp.

2af0ab30ecba4177a393cb57026cc1a3,Hydrogen and nitrogen codoping of anatase TiO 2 for efficiency enhancement in organic solar cells,"TiO2 has high chemical stability, strong catalytic activity and is an electron transport material in organic solar cells. However, the presence of trap states near the band edges of TiO2 arising from defects at grain boundaries significantly affects the efficiency of organic solar cells. To become an efficient electron transport material for organic photovoltaics and related devices, such as perovskite solar cells and photocatalytic devices, it is important to tailor its band edges via doping. Nitrogen ptype doping has attracted considerable attention in enhancing the photocatalytic efficiency of TiO2 under visible light irradiation while hydrogen ntype doping increases its electron conductivity. DFT calculations in TiO2 provide evidence that nitrogen and hydrogen can be incorporated in interstitial sites and possibly form NiHi, NiHO and NTiHi defects. The experimental results indicate that NiHi defects are most likely formed and these defects do not introduce deep level states. Furthermore, we show that the efficiency of P3HT:IC60BAbased organic photovoltaic devices is enhanced when using hydrogendoping and nitrogenhydrogen codoping of TiO2, both boosting the material ntype conductivity, with maximum power conversion efficiency reaching values of 6.51% and 6.58%, respectively, which are much higher than those of the cells with the asdeposited (4.87%) and nitrogendoped TiO2 (4.46%).",Maria Vasilopoulou; Nikolaos Kelaidis; Ermioni Polydorou; Anastasia Soultati; Dimitris Davazoglou; Panagiotis Argitis; Giorgos Papadimitropoulos; Dimitris Tsikritzis; Stella Kennou; Florian Auras; Dimitra G.

Cellbased HRT (cHRT) is an alternative approach that may allow certain physiological outcomes to be achieved with lower circulating hormone levels than pharmacological means due to participation of cells in the hypothalamuspituitaryovary feedback control loop. Here we describe the in vivo performance of 3D bioengineered ovarian constructs that recapitulate native cellcell interactions between ovarian granulosa and theca cells as an approach to cHRT. The constructs are fabricated using either Ca or Sr to crosslink alginate. Following implantation in ovariectomized (ovx) rats, the Srcrosslinked constructs achieve stable secretion of hormones during 90 days of study. Further, we show these constructs with isogeneic cells to be effective in ameliorating adverse effects of hormone deficiency, including bone health, uterine health, and body composition in this rat model. Cellbased hormone replacement therapy (cHRT) may be an alternative therapy to pharmacological (p)HRT. Here, the authors show that implanted 3D bioengineered ovarian constructs of granulosa and theca cells in ovariectomized rats recapitulate native cell interactions and improve efficacy compared to similar doses of pHRT.",Sivanandane Sittadjody; Justin M.

Recent advances in cell microcontact printing and microfluidics have facilitated the invitro study of homotypic and heterotypic cellcell interaction. Nonetheless, these techniques are still complicated to perform and as a result, are seldom used by biologists. We report here development of a temporarily sealed microfluidic stamping device which utilizes a novel valve design for patterning two adherent cell lines with welldefined interlacing configurations to study cellcell interactions. We demonstrate poststamping cell viability of 95%, the stamping of multiple adherent cell types, and the ability to control the seeded cell density. We also show viability, proliferation and migration of cultured cells, enabling analysis of coculture boundary conditions on cell fate. We also developed an invitro model of endothelial and cardiac stem cell interactions, which are thought to regulate coronary repair after myocardial injury. The stamp is fabricated using microfabrication techniques, is operated with a lab pipettor and uses very low reagent volumes of 20 l with cell injection efficiency of 70%.

An antiHPV16 neutralizing monoclonal antibody (NmAb) 26D1 was isolated from a memory B cell of a human vaccinee. The prebinding of heparan sulfate to VLPs inhibited the binding of both NmAbs to the antigen, indicating that the epitopes are critical for viral cell attachmententry. Hybrid VLP binding with surface loop swapping between types indicated the essential roles of the DE and FG loops for both 26D1 (DEa in particular) and H16.V5 binding. Specifically, Tyr135 and Val141 on the DEa loop were shown to be critical residues for 26D1 binding via sitedirected mutagenesis. Partially overlap between the epitopes between 26D1 and H16.V5 was shown using pairwise epitope mapping and their binding difference is demonstrated to be predominantly in DE loop region. In addition, 26D1 epitope is immunodominant epitope recognized by both antibodies elicited by the authentic virus from infected individuals and polyclonal antibodies from vaccinees.

Numerous tests of the Bell inequality have been reported as the groundbreaking discovery of the Bell theorem. Up to now, however, most discussions of the Bell scenario have focused on a single pair of entangled particles distributed to only two separated observers. Recently, it has been shown surprisingly that multiple observers can share the nonlocality from an entangled pair using the method of weak measurement without postselection Phys. Rev. Lett. 114, 250401 (2015)]. Here we report an observation of double CHSHBell inequality violations for a single pair of entangled photons with strength continuoustunable optimal weak measurement in a photonic system. Our results shed new light on the interplay between nonlocality and quantum measurements and our design of weak measurement protocol may also be significant for important applications such as unbounded randomness certification and quantum steering. A study shows that the nonlocality of quantum entangled particles can be shared among three observers. Since John Bell's 1964 theorem, which provides experimentally testable inequalities, Bell tests have been used to probe quantum theory. In a typical Bell test scenario, one pair of quantum entangled particles is distributed to two separate observers, usually referred to as Alice and Bob.

fc55559be657444db7b9701dd860151f,Glianeuron interactions underlie state transitions to generalized seizures,"Brain activity and connectivity alter drastically during epileptic seizures. The brain networks shift from a balanced resting state to a hyperactive and hypersynchronous state. It is, however, less clear which mechanisms underlie the state transitions. By studying neural and glial activity in zebrafish models of epileptic seizures, we observe striking differences between these networks. During the preictal period, neurons display a small increase in synchronous activity only locally, while the gapjunctioncoupled glial network was highly active and strongly synchronized across large distances. The transition from a preictal state to a generalized seizure leads to an abrupt increase in neural activity and connectivity, which is accompanied by a strong alteration in glianeuron interactions and a massive increase in extracellular glutamate. Optogenetic activation of glia excites nearby neurons through the action of glutamate and gap junctions, emphasizing a potential role for gliaglia and glianeuron connections in the generation of epileptic seizures. During epileptic seizures, neural activity across the brain switches into a hyperactive and hypersynchronized state. Here, the authors report on the role of gliaglia and glianeuron interactions in mediating the changes that result in the ictal state in a zebrafish model of epilepsy.",Carmen Diaz Verdugo; Sverre MyrenSvelstad; Ecem Aydin; Evelien Van Hoeymissen; Celine Deneubourg; Silke Vanderhaeghe; Julie Vancraeynest; Robbrecht Pelgrims; Mehmet Ilyas Cosacak; Akira Muto; Caghan Kizil; Koichi Kawakami; Nathalie JurischYaksi; Emre Yaksi,Diseases of the nervous system; Gliogenesis; Neural circuits,"Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences, Kavli Institute for Systems Neuroscience and Centre for Neural Computation, Norwegian University of Science and Technology, Trondheim, Norway; NeuroElectronics Research Flanders, Leuven, Belgium; KU Leuven, Leuven, Belgium; Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences, Kavli Institute for Systems Neuroscience and Centre for Neural Computation, Norwegian University of Science and Technology, Trondheim, Norway; Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences, Department of Neuromedicine and Movement Science, Norwegian University of Science and Technology, Trondheim, Norway; Department of Neurology and Clinical Neurophysiology, St. Olav's University Hospital, Trondheim, Norway; Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences, Kavli Institute for Systems Neuroscience and Centre for Neural Computation, Norwegian University of Science and Technology, Trondheim, Norway; Department of Biomedical Engineering, Izmir Katip Celebi University, Izmir, Turkey; Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences, Kavli Institute for Systems Neuroscience and Centre for Neural Computation, Norwegian University of Science and Technology, Trondheim, Norway; KU Leuven, Leuven, Belgium; Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences, Kavli Institute for Systems Neuroscience and Centre for Neural Computation, Norwegian University of Science and Technology, Trondheim, Norway; KU Leuven, Leuven, Belgium; Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences, Kavli Institute for Systems Neuroscience and Centre for Neural Computation, Norwegian University of Science and Technology, Trondheim, Norway; KU Leuven, Leuven, Belgium; Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences, Kavli Institute for Systems Neuroscience and Centre for Neural Computation, Norwegian University of Science and Technology, Trondheim, Norway; KU Leuven, Leuven, Belgium; Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences, Kavli Institute for Systems Neuroscience and Centre for Neural Computation, Norwegian University of Science and Technology, Trondheim, Norway; German Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases (DZNE) Dresden, Helmholtz Association  Technische Universitat Dresden, Center for Molecular and Cellular Bioengineering (CMCB), Center for Regenerative Therapies Dresden (CRTD), Dresden, Germany; Laboratory of Molecular and Developmental Biology, National Institute of Genetics, and Department of Genetics, SOKENDAI (The Graduate University for Advanced Studies), Mishima, Shizuoka, Japan; German Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases (DZNE) Dresden, Helmholtz Association  Technische Universitat Dresden, Center for Molecular and Cellular Bioengineering (CMCB), Center for Regenerative Therapies Dresden (CRTD), Dresden, Germany; Laboratory of Molecular and Developmental Biology, National Institute of Genetics, and Department of Genetics, SOKENDAI (The Graduate University for Advanced Studies), Mishima, Shizuoka, Japan; Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences, Kavli Institute for Systems Neuroscience and Centre for Neural Computation, Norwegian University of Science and Technology, Trondheim, Norway; Department of Neurology and Clinical Neurophysiology, St. Olav's University Hospital, Trondheim, Norway; Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences, Department of Clinical and Molecular Medicine, Norwegian University of Science and Technology, Trondheim, Norway; Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences, Kavli Institute for Systems Neuroscience and Centre for Neural Computation, Norwegian University of Science and Technology, Trondheim, Norway; NeuroElectronics Research Flanders, Leuven, Belgium; KU Leuven, Leuven, Belgium; Department of Neurology and Clinical Neurophysiology, St. Olav's University Hospital, Trondheim, Norway"
94c02712a24845a1a6a0af19b204b8c9,Genuswide sequencing supports a twolocus model for sexdetermination in Phoenix,"The date palm tree is a commercially important member of the genus Phoenix whose 14 species are dioecious with separate male and female individuals. To identify sex determining genes we sequenced the genomes of 15 female and 13 male Phoenix trees representing all 14 species. We identified malespecific sequences and extended them using phased singlemolecule sequencing or BAC clones. We observed that only four genes contained sequences conserved in all analyzed Phoenix males. Most of these sequences showed similarity to a single genomic locus in the closely related monoecious oil palm. CYP703 and GPAT3, two single copy genes present in males and critical for male flower development in other monocots, were absent in females. A LOGlike gene appears translocated into the Ylinked region and is suggested to play a role in suppressing female flowers. Our data are consistent with a twomutation model for the evolution of dioecy in Phoenix. The origin and evolution of separate sexes in plants are longstanding questions. Here, the authors use genuswide sequencing to identify sex determining candidate genes in the genus Phoenix and demonstrate the consistence with the previously proposed twomutation model.",Maria F.

195c857c4e8b478ba8d36b4f0005356a,Targeting PLK1 overcomes TDM1 resistance via CDK1dependent phosphorylation and inactivation of Bcl2xL in HER2positive breast cancer,"Trastuzumabrefractory, HER2 (human epidermal growth factor receptor 2)positive breast cancer is commonly treated with trastuzumab emtansine (TDM1), an antibodydrug conjugate of trastuzumab and the microtubuletargeting agent, DM1. However, drug response reduces greatly over time due to acquisition of resistance whose molecular mechanisms are mostly unknown. Here, we uncovered a novel mechanism of resistance against TDM1 by combining whole transcriptome sequencing (RNASeq), proteomics and a targeted small interfering RNA (siRNA) sensitization screen for molecular level analysis of acquired and de novo TDM1resistant models of HER2overexpressing breast cancer. We identified Pololike kinase 1 (PLK1), a mitotic kinase, as a resistance mediator whose genomic as well as pharmacological inhibition restored drug sensitivity. Both acquired and de novo resistant models exhibited synergistic growth inhibition upon combination of TDM1 with a selective PLK1 inhibitor, volasertib, at a wide concentration range of the two drugs. Mechanistically, TDM1 sensitization upon PLK1 inhibition with volasertib was initiated by a spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC)dependent mitotic arrest, leading to caspase activation, followed by DNA damage through CDK1dependent phosphorylation and inactivation of Bcl2xL. Furthermore, we showed that Ser70 phosphorylation of Bcl2 directly regulates apoptosis by disrupting the binding to and sequestration of the proapoptotic protein Bim. Importantly, TDM1 resistance signature or PLK1 expression correlated with cell cycle progression and DNA repair, and predicted a lower sensitivity to taxanetrastuzumab combination in HER2positive breast cancer patients. Finally, volasertib in combination with TDM1 greatly synergized in models of TDM1 resistance in terms of growth inhibition both in three dimensional (3D) cell culture and in vivo. Altogether, our results provide promising preclinical evidence for potential testing of TDM1volasertib combination in TDM1 refractory HER2positive breast cancer patients for whom there is currently no treatment available.",Ozge Saatci; Simone Borgoni; Ozge Akbulut; Selvi Durmus; Umar Raza; Erol Eyupoglu; Can Alkan; Aytekin Akyol; Ozgur Kutuk; Stefan Wiemann; Ozgur Sahin,Breast cancer; Cancer therapeutic resistance,"Department of Molecular Biology and Genetics, Faculty of Science, Bilkent University, Ankara, Turkey; Division of Molecular Genome Analysis, German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), INF580, Heidelberg, Germany; Department of Molecular Biology and Genetics, Faculty of Science, Bilkent University, Ankara, Turkey; Department of Molecular Biology and Genetics, Faculty of Science, Bilkent University, Ankara, Turkey; Department of Molecular Biology and Genetics, Faculty of Science, Bilkent University, Ankara, Turkey; Department of Molecular Biology and Genetics, Faculty of Science, Bilkent University, Ankara, Turkey; Department of Computer Engineering, Bilkent University, Ankara, Turkey; Department of Pathology, Hacettepe University School of Medicine, Ankara, Turkey; Department of Medical Genetics, Baskent University, Adana, Turkey; Division of Molecular Genome Analysis, German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), INF580, Heidelberg, Germany; Department of Molecular Biology and Genetics, Faculty of Science, Bilkent University, Ankara, Turkey; National Nanotechnology Research Center (UNAM), Bilkent University, Ankara, Turkey"

Here, we report a quadruple perovskite oxide CaCu3Ru4O12 as a superior catalyst for acidic water oxidation. This complex oxide exhibits an ultrasmall overpotential of 171 mV at 10 mA cm2geo, which is much lower than that of the stateoftheart RuO2. Moreover, compared to RuO2, CaCu3Ru4O12 shows a significant increase in mass activity by more than two orders of magnitude and much better stability. Density functional theory calculations reveal that the quadruple perovskite catalyst has a lower Ru 4dband center relative to RuO2, which effectively optimizes the binding energy of oxygen intermediates and thereby enhances the catalytic activity. Electrocatalytic water splitting provides a renewable path to store energy in chemical bonds, but highly efficient oxygenevolving catalysts in acid media remain limited.

Here we introduce a powerful new method, ASMC, that can estimate coalescence times using only SNP array data, and is orders of magnitude faster than previous approaches. We applied ASMC to detect recent positive selection in 113,851 phased British samples from the UK Biobank, and detected 12 genomewide significant signals, including 6 novel loci. We also applied ASMC to sequencing data from 498 Dutch individuals to detect background selection at deeper time scales. We detected strong heritability enrichment in regions of high background selection in an analysis of 20 independent diseases and complex traits using stratified linkage disequilibrium score regression, conditioned on a broad set of functional annotations (including other background selection annotations). These results underscore the widespread effects of background selection on the genetic architecture of complex traits.

cf263cec7a9f49ebb8b40a6317cb2125,Epigenetic variance in dopamine D2 receptor: a marker of IQ malleability?,"Genetic and environmental factors both contribute to cognitive test performance. A substantial increase in average intelligence test results in the second half of the previous century within one generation is unlikely to be explained by genetic changes. One possible explanation for the strong malleability of cognitive performance measure is that environmental factors modify gene expression via epigenetic mechanisms. Epigenetic factors may help to understand the recent observations of an association between dopaminedependent encoding of reward prediction errors and cognitive capacity, which was modulated by adverse life events. The possible manifestation of malleable biomarkers contributing to variance in cognitive test performance, and thus possibly contributing to the ""missing heritability"" between estimates from twin studies and variance explained by genetic markers, is still unclear. Here we show in 1475 healthy adolescents from the IMaging and GENetics (IMAGEN) sample that general IQ (gIQ) is associated with (1) polygenic scores for intelligence, (2) epigenetic modification of DRD2 gene, (3) gray matter density in striatum, and (4) functional striatal activation elicited by temporarily surprising rewardpredicting cues. Comparing the relative importance for the prediction of gIQ in an overlapping subsample, our results demonstrate neurobiological correlates of the malleability of gIQ and point to equal importance of genetic variance, epigenetic modification of DRD2 receptor gene, as well as functional striatal activation, known to influence dopamine neurotransmission. Peripheral epigenetic markers are in need of confirmation in the central nervous system and should be tested in longitudinal settings specifically assessing individual and environmental factors that modify epigenetic structure.",Jakob A.

Here we report a safe mUncoupler, OPC163493, which has unique pharmacokinetic characteristics. OPC163493 shows a good bioavailability upon oral administration and primarily distributed to specific organs: the liver and kidneys, avoiding systemic toxicities. It exhibits insulinindependent antidiabetic effects in multiple animal models of type I and type II diabetes and antisteatotic effects in fatty liver models. These beneficial effects can be explained by the improvement of glucose metabolism and enhancement of energy expenditure by OPC163493 in the liver. Moreover, OPC163493 treatment lowered blood pressure, extended survival, and improved renal function in the rat model of strokehypertension, possibly by enhancing NO bioavailability in blood vessels and reducing mitochondrial ROS production. OPC163493 is a liverlocalizedtargeted mUncoupler that ameliorates various complications of diabetes. Mitochondrial uncoupling is a treatment strategy for metabolic diseases that reduces the efficiency of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation and ATP generation. Here the authors characterize the pharmacokinetic and therapeutic properties of the liverlocalized mitochondrial uncoupler OPC163493, which leads to amelioration of diabetes and hypertension in several rodent disease models.",Naohide Kanemoto; Takashi Okamoto; Koji Tanabe; Takahiro Shimada; Hitomi Minoshima; Yuya Hidoh; Masashi Aoyama; Takashi Ban; Yusuke Kobayashi; Hikaru Ando; Yuki Inoue; Motohiro Itotani; Seiji Sato,Diabetes; Hypertension; Mitochondria; Pharmaceutics,"Department of Lead Discovery Research, New Drug Research Division, Otsuka Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., Tokushima, Japan; Department of Lead Discovery Research, New Drug Research Division, Otsuka Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., Tokushima, Japan; Department of CNS Research, New Drug Research Division, Otsuka Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., Tokushima, Japan; Department of Drug Metabolism and Pharmacokinetics, Nonclinical Research Center, Tokushima Research Institute, Otsuka Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., Tokushima, Japan; Pharmaceutical Planning Group, Otsuka Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan; Department of Drug Metabolism and Pharmacokinetics, Nonclinical Research Center, Tokushima Research Institute, Otsuka Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., Tokushima, Japan; Biology and Translational Research Unit, Department of Medical Innovations, New Drug Research Division, Otsuka Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., Tokushima, Japan; Department of Renal and Cardiovascular Research, New Drug Research Division, Otsuka Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., Tokushima, Japan; Department of Lead Discovery Research, New Drug Research Division, Otsuka Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., Tokushima, Japan; Department of Lead Discovery Research, New Drug Research Division, Otsuka Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., Tokushima, Japan; Department of Drug Safety Research, Nonclinical Research Center, Tokushima Research Institute, Otsuka Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., Tokushima, Japan; Quality Assurance Section (Tokushima Wajiki Factory), Quality Assurance Department, Headquarters for Product Safety and Quality Assurance, Otsuka Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., Tokushima, Japan; Medicinal Chemistry Research Laboratories, New Drug Research Division, Otsuka Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., Tokushima, Japan"

We demonstrate that both quantities reveal pronounced resonances, whose positions can be controlled by tuning of an asymmetry of the couplings of the QD and a pair of MFs. Similar behavior is revealed for the thermopower, WiedemannFranz law and dimensionless thermoelectric figure of merit. The considered geometry can thus be used as a tuner of heat and charge transport assisted by MFs.",L. S. Ricco; F. A. Dessotti; I. A. Shelykh; M. S. Figueira; A. C.

68af8bc3f8dd4b48a056da6b533f3b5f,Assessment of intrinsic and extrinsic signaling pathway in excitotoxic retinal ganglion cell death,"Excitotoxicity leads to the activation of a cytotoxic cascade that causes neuronal death. In the retina, retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) die after an excitotoxic insult. Multiple pathways have been proposed to contribute to RGC death after an excitotoxic insult, including TNF signaling, JNK activation, and ER stress. To test the importance of these pathways in RGC death after excitotoxic injury, the excitotoxin NmethylDaspartate (NMDA) was intravitreally injected into mice deficient in components of these pathways. Absence of Tnf or its canonical downstream mediator, Bid, did not confer short or longterm protection to RGCs. Despite known activation in RGCs and a prominent role in mediating RGC death after other insults, attenuating JNK signaling did not prevent RGC death after excitotoxic insult. Additionally, deficiency of the ER stress protein DDIT3 (CHOP), which has been shown to be involved in RGC death, did not lessen NMDA induced RGC death. Furthermore, absence of both Jun (JNK's canonical target) and Ddit3, which together provide robust, longterm protection to RGC somas after axonal insult, did not lessen RGC death. Collectively, these results indicate that the drivers of excitotoxic injury remain to be identified andor multiple cell death pathways are activated in response to injury.",Berkeley K.

Here, we report a fast, largescale, and threedimensional superresolution fluorescence microscope based on singlewavelength Bessel lightsheet to selectively illuminate spontaneous blinking fluorophores tagged to the proteins of interest in space. Critical parameters such as labeling density, excitation power, and exposure time were systematically optimized resulting in a maximum imaging speed of 2.7  104 m3 s1. Fourier ring correlation analysis revealed a reconstructed image with a lateral resolution of ~75 nm through the accumulation of 250 image volumes on immobilized samples within 15 min. Hence, the designed system could open new insights into the discovery of complex biological structures and live 3D localization imaging. Lu, Tang, Liu et al. present a 3D superresolution fluorescence microscope that uses selective plane illumination and a spontaneously blinking dye for localizationbased imaging. They show that their microscope can be used to study complex biological structures.",ChiehHan Lu; WeiChun Tang; YenTing Liu; ShuWei Chang; Frances Camille M.

ec56e10f279042fea7e124bb3454afab,Metaanalysis of epigenomewide association studies in neonates reveals widespread differential DNA methylation associated with birthweight,"Birthweight is associated with health outcomes across the life course, DNA methylation may be an underlying mechanism. In this metaanalysis of epigenomewide association studies of 8,825 neonates from 24 birth cohorts in the Pregnancy And Childhood Epigenetics Consortium, we find that DNA methylation in neonatal blood is associated with birthweight at 914 sites, with a difference in birthweight ranging from 183 to 178 grams per 10% increase in methylation (PBonferroni  1.06 x 107). In additional analyses in 7,278 participants, 1.3% of birthweightassociated differential methylation is also observed in childhood and adolescence, but not adulthood. Birthweightrelated CpGs overlap with some Bonferronisignificant CpGs that were previously reported to be related to maternal smoking (55914, p  6.12 x 1074) and BMI in pregnancy (3914, p  1.13x103), but not with those related to folate levels in pregnancy. Whether the associations that we observe are causal or explained by confounding or fetal growth influencing DNA methylation (i.e. reverse causality) requires further research. Birthweight has been found to associate with laterlife health outcomes. Here the authors perform a metaanalysis of epigenomewide association studies of 8,825 neonates from 24 birth cohorts in the Pregnancy And Childhood Epigenetics Consortium, identifying differentially methylated CpGs in neonatal blood that associate with birthweight.",Leanne K.

An association between PA and longterm mortality in ICU patients has not been demonstrated before. The purpose of the present study was to determine whether PA on ICU admission independently predicts 90day mortality. This prospective observational study was performed in a mixed university ICU. BIA was performed in 196 patients within 24 h of ICU admission. To test the independent association between PA and 90day mortality, logistic regression analysis was performed using the APACHE IV predicted mortality as confounder. The optimal cutoff value of PA for mortality prediction was determined by ROC curve analysis. Using this cutoff value, patients were categorized into low or normal PA group and the association with 90day mortality was tested again. The PA of survivors was higher than of the nonsurvivors (5.0  1.3 vs. 4.1  1.2, p  0.001). The area under the ROC curve of PA for 90day mortality was 0.70 (CI 0.590.80). PA was associated with 90day mortality (OR  0.56, CI: 0.380.77, p  0.001) on univariate logistic regression analysis and also after adjusting for BMI, gender, age, and APACHE IV on multivariable logistic regression (OR  0.65, CI: 0.440.96, p  0.031). A PA  4.8 was an independent predictor of 90day mortality (adjusted OR  3.65, CI: 1.349.93, p  0.011). Phase angle at ICU admission is an independent predictor of 90day mortality. This biological marker can aid in longterm mortality risk assessment of critically ill patients.",Sandra N. Stapel; Wilhelmus G. P. M. Looijaard; Ingeborg M. Dekker; Armand R. J. Girbes; Peter J. M.

It may lead to even more efficient energy generation if obtained in a polarized state, that is with the spin of the reactants aligned. Here, we report firstprinciples predictions of the polarized DT fusion using nuclear forces from effective field theory. By employing the ab initio nocore shell model with continuum reaction method to solve the quantum mechanical fivenucleon problem, we accurately determine the enhanced fusion rate and angular distribution of the emitted neutron and 4He. Our calculations demonstrate in detail the small contribution of anisotropies, placing on a firmer footing the understanding of the rate of DT fusion in a polarized plasma. In the future, analogous calculations could be used to obtain accurate values for other, more uncertain thermonuclear reaction data critical to nuclear science applications.

We sought to identify a signature of rare inherited variants that distinguishes between these two extreme phenotypes. We sequenced germline whole exomes from 139 aggressive (metastatic, age of diagnosis  60) and 141 nonaggressive (low clinical grade, age of diagnosis 60) PrCa cases. We conducted rare variant association analyses at gene and gene set levels using SKAT and Bayesian risk index techniques. GO term enrichment analysis was performed for genes with the highest differential burden of rare disruptive variants. Protein truncating variants (PTVs) in specific DNA repair genes were significantly overrepresented among patients with the aggressive phenotype, with BRCA2, ATM and NBN the most frequently mutated genes. Differential burden of rare variants was identified between metastatic and nonaggressive cases for several genes implicated in angiogenesis, conferring both deleterious and protective effects. Inherited PTVs in several DNA repair genes distinguish aggressive from nonaggressive PrCa cases. Furthermore, inherited variants in genes with roles in angiogenesis may be potential predictors for risk of metastases. If validated in a larger dataset, these findings have potential for future clinical application.",Martina Mijuskovic; Edward J. Saunders; Daniel A.

Here we show that EMILIN2 promotes angiogenesis by directly binding epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), which enhances interleukin8 (IL8) production. In turn, IL8 stimulates the proliferation and migration of vascular endothelial cells. Emilin2 null mice were generated and exhibited delayed retinal vascular development, which was rescued by the administration of the IL8 murine ortholog MIP2. Next, we assessed tumor growth and tumorassociated angiogenesis in these mice. Tumor cell growth in Emilin2 null mice was impaired as well as the expression of MIP2. The vascular density of the tumors developed in Emilin2 null mice was prejudiced and vessels perfusion, as well as response to chemotherapy, decreased. Accordingly, human tumors expressing high levels of EMILIN2 were more responsive to chemotherapy. These results point at EMILIN2 as a key microenvironmental cue affecting vessel formation and unveil the possibility to develop new prognostic tools to predict chemotherapy efficacy.",Alice Paulitti; Eva Andreuzzi; Dario Bizzotto; Rosanna Pellicani; Giulia Tarticchio; Stefano Marastoni; Chiara Pastrello; Igor Jurisica; Giovanni Ligresti; Francesco Bucciotti; Roberto Doliana; Roberta Colladel; Paola Braghetta; Evelina Poletto; Alessia Di Silvestre; Giorgio Bressan; Alfonso Colombatti; Paolo Bonaldo; Maurizio Mongiat,Cancer microenvironment; Tumour angiogenesis,"Department of Translational Research, Division of Molecular Oncology, CRO, Aviano, Italy; Department of Translational Research, Division of Molecular Oncology, CRO, Aviano, Italy; Department of Molecular Medicine, University of Padova, Padova, Italy; Department of Translational Research, Division of Molecular Oncology, CRO, Aviano, Italy; Department of Translational Research, Division of Molecular Oncology, CRO, Aviano, Italy; Department of Computer Science, Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, Toronto, Canada; Department of Computer Science, Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, Toronto, Canada; Department of Computer Science, Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, Toronto, Canada; Department of Medical Biophysics, University of Toronto, Toronto, Canada; Department of Tissue Repair and Meccano Biology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, USA; Department of Translational Research, Division of Molecular Oncology, CRO, Aviano, Italy; Department of Translational Research, Division of Molecular Oncology, CRO, Aviano, Italy; Department of Translational Research, Division of Molecular Oncology, CRO, Aviano, Italy; Department of Molecular Medicine, University of Padova, Padova, Italy; Department of Translational Research, Division of Molecular Oncology, CRO, Aviano, Italy; Department of Translational Research, Division of Molecular Oncology, CRO, Aviano, Italy; Department of Molecular Medicine, University of Padova, Padova, Italy; Department of Translational Research, Division of Molecular Oncology, CRO, Aviano, Italy; Department of Molecular Medicine, University of Padova, Padova, Italy; Department of Translational Research, Division of Molecular Oncology, CRO, Aviano, Italy"

Here we report the study of electron transfer through amideamide hydrogen bonded interfaces in mixedvalence complexes with covalently bonded Mo2 units as the electron donor and acceptor. The rate constants for electron transfer through the dual hydrogen bonds across a distance of 12.5 A are on the order of  1010 s1, as determined by optical analysis based on MarcusHush theory and simulation of (NH) vibrational band broadening, with the electron transfer efficiencies comparable to that of  conjugated bridges. This work demonstrates that electron transfer across a hydrogen bond may proceed via the known protoncoupled pathway, as well as an overlooked protonuncoupled pathway that does not involve proton transfer. A mechanistic switch between the two pathways can be achieved by manipulation of the strengths of electronic coupling and hydrogen bonding. The knowledge of the nonproton coupled pathway has shed light on charge and energy transport in biological systems. Thermal electron transfer across hydrogen bond remains largely unexplored.

Therapeutic approaches to limit progression are limited. Developing tools for the early identification of those individuals most likely to progress will allow enriching clinical trials in high risk early CKD patients. The CKD273 classifier is a panel of 273 urinary peptides that enables early detection of CKD and prognosis of progression. We have generated urine capillary electrophoresismass spectrometrybased peptidomics CKD273 subclassifiers specific for CKD stages to allow the early identification of patients at high risk of CKD progression. In the validation cohort, the CKD273 subclassifiers outperformed albuminuria and CKD273 classifier for predicting rapid loss of eGFR in individuals with baseline eGFR  60 mlmin1.73 m2. In individuals with eGFR  60 mlmin1.73 m2 and albuminuria 30 mgday, the CKD273 subclassifiers predicted rapid eGFR loss with AUC ranging from 0.797 (0.7430.844) to 0.736 (0.6890.780). The association between CKD273 subclassifiers and rapid progression remained significant after adjustment for age, sex, albuminuria, DM, baseline eGFR, and systolic blood pressure. Urinary peptidomics CKD273 subclassifiers outperformed albuminuria and CKD273 classifier for predicting the risk of rapid CKD progression in individuals with eGFR  60 mlmin1.73 m2.

ad2f5d65e1d14b75816e8120627f135d,LLGL2 rescues nutrient stress by promoting leucine uptake in ER  breast cancer,"Drosophila Lgl and its mammalian homologues, LLGL1 and LLGL2, are scaffolding proteins that regulate the establishment of apicalbasal polarity in epithelial cells1,2. Whereas Lgl functions as a tumour suppressor in Drosophila1, the roles of mammalian LLGL1 and LLGL2 in cancer are unclear. The majority (about 75%) of breast cancers express oestrogen receptors (ERs)3, and patients with these tumours receive endocrine treatment4. However, the development of resistance to endocrine therapy and metastatic progression are leading causes of death for patients with ER disease4. Here we report that, unlike LLGL1, LLGL2 is overexpressed in ER breast cancer and promotes cell proliferation under nutrient stress. LLGL2 regulates cell surface levels of a leucine transporter, SLC7A5, by forming a trimeric complex with SLC7A5 and a regulator of membrane fusion, YKT6, to promote leucine uptake and cell proliferation. The oestrogen receptor targets LLGL2 expression. Resistance to endocrine treatment in breast cancer cells was associated with SLC7A5 and LLGL2dependent adaption to nutrient stress. SLC7A5 was necessary and sufficient to confer resistance to tamoxifen treatment, identifying SLC7A5 as a potential therapeutic target for overcoming resistance to endocrine treatments in breast cancer. Thus, LLGL2 functions as a promoter of tumour growth and not as a tumour suppressor in ER breast cancer. Beyond breast cancer, adaptation to nutrient stress is critically important5, and our findings identify an unexpected role for LLGL2 in this process. The polarity protein LLGL2 supports tumour growth in breast cancer by promoting leucine uptake and adaptation to nutrient stress.",Yasuhiro Saito; Lewyn Li; Etienne Coyaud; Augustin Luna; Chris Sander; Brian Raught; John M.

5d9d23552e35407e8a71e47bf230c181,SLC26A3 (DRA) prevents TNFalphainduced barrier dysfunction and dextran sulfate sodiuminduced acute colitis,"SLC26A3 encodes a ClHCO3 ion transporter that is also known as downregulated in adenoma (DRA) and is involved in HCO3mucus formation. The role of DRA in the epithelial barrier has not been previously established. In this study, we investigated the in vivo and in vitro mechanisms of DRA in the colon epithelial barrier. Immunofluorescence (IF) and coimmunoprecipitation (coIP) studies reveal that DRA binds directly to tight junction (TJ) proteins and affects the expression of TJ proteins in polarized Caco2BBe cells. Similarly, DRA colocalizes with ZO1 in the intestinal epithelium. Knockdown or overexpression of DRA leads to alterations in TJ proteins and epithelial permeability. In addition, TNF treatment downregulates DRA by activating NFB and subsequently affecting intestinal epithelial barrier integrity. Furthermore, overexpression of DRA partly reverses the TNFinduced damage by stabilizing TJ proteins. Neutralization of TNF in dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)induced colitis mice demonstrates improved the outcomes, and the therapeutic effect of the TNF neutralizing mAb is mediated in part by the preservation of DRA expression. These data suggest that DRA may be one of the therapeutic targets of TNF. Moreover, DRA delivered by adenovirus vector significantly prevents the exacerbation of colitis and improves epithelial barrier function by promoting the recovery of TJ proteins in DSStreated mice. In conclusion, DRA plays a role in protecting the epithelial barrier and may be a therapeutic target in gut homeostasis.",Xiangming Ding; Dongxiao Li; Mengke Li; Han Wang; Qin He; Yunwu Wang; Hongbing Yu; Dean Tian; Qin Yu,Colitis; Mechanisms of disease; Proteinprotein interaction networks; Ulcerative colitis,"Department of Gastroenterology, Tongji Hospital, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Hubei Sheng, China; Department of Gastroenterology, Tongji Hospital, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Hubei Sheng, China; Department of Gastroenterology, Tongji Hospital, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Hubei Sheng, China; Department of Gastroenterology, Zhoushan Hospital, Zhoushan, China; Department of Gastroenterology, Tongji Hospital, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Hubei Sheng, China; Department of Gastroenterology, Tongji Hospital, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Hubei Sheng, China; Department of Gastroenterology, Tongji Hospital, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Hubei Sheng, China; Department of Pediatrics, BC Children's Hospital and the University of British Columbia, Vancouver, Canada; Department of Gastroenterology, Tongji Hospital, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Hubei Sheng, China; Department of Gastroenterology, Tongji Hospital, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Hubei Sheng, China"
59a215d1668a4376b8aa1506a8ac2154,Reactive oxygen species stress increases accumulation of tyrosylDNA phsosphodiesterase 1 within mitochondria,"TyrosylDNA phosphodiesterase 1 (Tdp1) is a nuclear and mitochondrial protein that in nuclei and in vitro repairs blocked 3 DNA termini such as 3 phosphotyrosine conjugates resulting from stalling of topoisomerase IDNA intermediates. Its mutation also causes spinocerebellar ataxia with axonal neuropathy type 1 (SCAN1). Because Tdp1 colocalizes with mitochondria following oxidative stress, we hypothesized that Tdp1 repairs mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) and that mtDNA damage mediates entry of Tdp1 into the mitochondria. To test this, we used S. cerevisiae mutants, cultured mouse and human cells, and a Tdp1 knockout mouse. H2O2 and rotenoneinduced cellular and intramitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) activated oxidantresponsive kinases P38 and ERK1, and the translocation of Tdp1 from the nucleus to the mitochondria via the TIMTOM complex. This translocation occurred independently of mtDNA. Within the mitochondria, Tdp1 interacted with Ligase III and reduced mtDNA mutations. Tdp1deficient tissues had impaired mitochondrial respiration and decreased viability. These observations suggest that Tdp1 maintains mtDNA integrity and support the hypothesis that mitochondrial dysfunction contributes to the pathology of SCAN1.",Hok Khim Fam; Kunho Choi; Lauren Fougner; Chinten James Lim; Cornelius F.

Rodent model showed association of C4 with synaptic pruning suggesting its pathophysiological significance (Sekar, A. et al. (2016)). We, therefore, predicted that C4A GCN would be positively correlated with neuropil contraction in the human brain among schizophrenia patients showing more prominent correlations in ventral regions among young adults and dorsal regions among adolescents since neuromaturation progresses dorsoventrally. Wholebrain, multivoxel, in vivo phosphorus magnetic resonance spectroscopy (31P MRS) assessed neuropil changes by estimating levels of membrane phospholipid (MPL) precursors and catabolites. Increased MPL catabolites andor decreased MPL precursors indexed neuropil contraction. Digital droplet PCRbased assay was used to estimate C4A and C4B GCN. We evaluated two independent cohorts (young adultonset earlycourse schizophrenia (YASZ  15) and adolescentonset schizophrenia (AOSZ  12) patients), and controls matched for each group, n  22 and 15, respectively. Separate forward stepwise linear regression models with Akaike information Criterion were built for MPL catabolites and precursors. YASZ cohort: Consistent with the rodent model (Sekar, A. et al. 2016)), C4A GCN positively correlated with neuropil contraction (increased pruningdecreased formation) in the inferior frontal cortex and inferior parietal lobule. AOSZ cohort: C4A GCN positively correlated with neuropil contraction in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and thalamus. Exploratory analysis of C4B GCN showed positive correlation with neuropil contraction in the cerebellum and superior temporal gyrus among YASZ while AOSZ showed neuropil contraction in the prefrontal and subcortical structures. Thus, C4A and C4B GCN are associated with neuropil contraction in regions often associated with schizophrenia, and may be neuromaturationally dependent.",Konasale M. Prasad; Kodavali V.

We optimized a novel expansion protocol to stimulate donorspecific Tregs using soluble 4trimer CD40 ligand (CD40L)activated donor B cells that expressed mature antigenpresenting cell markers. This avoided the use of CD40Lexpressing stimulator cells that might otherwise result in potential cellular contamination. Purified allogeneic ""recipient"" CD4CD25 Tregs were stimulated on days 0 and 7 with expanded ""donor"" B cells in the presence of IL2, TGF and sirolimus (SRL). Tregs were further amplified by polyclonal stimulation with antiCD3CD28 beads on day 14 without SRL, and harvested on day 21, with extrapolated fold expansion into the thousands. The expanded AgTregs maintained expression of classical Treg markers including demethylation of the Tregspecific demethylated region (CNS2) and also displayed constricted TcR repertoire. We observed AgTregs more potently inhibited MLR than polyclonally expanded Tregs and generated new Tregs in autologous responder cells (a measure of infectious tolerance).

The current gold standard for treatment is topical steroids, but low ocular bioavailability and compliance issues with the intensive dosing regimen limit the efficacy of this treatment. Liposomes as a drug delivery system may help to overcome these problems. We studied the efficacy of a PEGliposomal formulation of liposomal steroids, administered as a single subconjunctival dose, in the treatment of experimental uveitis in rabbit eyes. Rabbits that received subconjunctival liposomal triamcinolone acetonide phosphate (LTAP) or liposomal prednisolone phosphate (LPP) had significantly lower mean inflammatory scores than untreated controls on Day 4 after induction of uveitis (LPP vs controls, p  0.049) and 8 (LPP vs controls, p  0.007; LTAP vs controls, p  0.019), and lower scores than rabbits given topical PredForte1% 4 times a day on Day 8 (p  0.03). After antigen rechallenge, the subconjunctival liposomal steroid groups continued to have greater suppression of inflammation than untreated controls on Day 11 (p  0.02).

The objective was to identify mRNA targets of dysregulated miRNAs in OSCC using integrated analysis and understand molecular abnormality in surgical margins. We used biopsies along the spatial axis from normal tissue defined by narrow band imaging (NBI) through conventional white light (WL) margins to tumour from 18 patients undergoing surgical resection for OSCC. Overall 119 miRNA and 4794 mRNA were differentially expressed along the adjacent normal tissue to tumour axis. Analysis of miRNA profiles demonstrated the NBI margins were molecularly distinct from both the tumour and WL margin. Integrated analysis identified 193 miRNAmRNA interactions correlated to the spatial axis of NBIWLT. We used crossvalidation analysis to derive a spatial interactome signature of OSCC comprising 100 putative miRNAmRNA interactions between 40 miRNA and 96 mRNA. Bioinformatic analysis suggests that miRNA dysregulation in OSCC may contribute to activation of the oncostatin M, BDNF and TGF pathways. Our data demonstrates that surgical margins defined by NBI leave less potentially malignant residual tissue.

Autophagy has been found involved in the lipid metabolism regulation through a bidirectional mechanism of inducing lipolysis as well as promoting lipid droplet formation. However, whether and how autophagy influences lipid accumulation in kidney fibrosis remain unclear. In the current study, we show that UUOinduced lipid accumulation in tubular cells was significantly reduced when the pharmacological inhibitor 3MA or CQ was administrated both in vivo and in vitro. Of interest, colocalization of LDs and autophagosomes, as well as colocalization of LDs and lysosomes were undetected in UUOinduced fibrotic kidneys, although lysosome function remained robust, indicating the lipid accumulation is lipophagylysosome pathway independent. TGF1induced lipid droplets formation in HK2 cells were decreased when the Beclin1 expression was silenced, implying that autophagyupregulated lipid droplets formation is Beclin1 dependent. Finally, CQ treatment of UUOinduced fibrotic kidneys reduced the expression of SMA and tubular cell apoptosis and rescued the expression of Ecadherin, which was associated with the ameliorated lipid deposition. Therefore, our work documented that autophagy promotes lipid droplet formation in TECs in a Beclin1dependent manner, which causes renal lipotoxicity and contributes to the progression of kidney fibrosis.",Qi Yan; Yuan Song; Lu Zhang; Zhaowei Chen; Cheng Yang; Shan Liu; Xiaohan Yuan; Hongyu Gao; Guohua Ding; Huiming Wang,"Life Sciences, general; Biochemistry, general; Cell Biology; Stem Cells; Apoptosis; Cell Cycle Analysis","Department of Nephrology, Renmin hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, China; Department of Geriatrics, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China; Department of Nephrology, Renmin hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, China; Department of Nephrology, Renmin hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, China; Department of Nephrology, Renmin hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, China; Department of Nephrology, Renmin hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, China; Department of Nephrology, University Hospital of Hubei University for Nationalities, Enshi, China; Department of Nephrology, Renmin hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, China; Department of Geriatrics, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China; Department of Nephrology, Renmin hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, China; Department of Nephrology, Renmin hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, China"

Elucidating the pathogenesis of glaucoma and developing effective treatment should be the priority. Inflammation and oxidative stress play essential roles in glaucoma pathogeneisis. Kaempferol is a natural flavonol and has antiinflammatory and antioxidative activities. In this study, we explored the potential effects of kaempferol on acute glaucoma. We established the retinal ischemiareperfusion (IR) mice model and administrated kaempferol to IR mice. We monitored the retina thickness change, retinal ganglion cell (RGC) death, caspase8 and caspase3 activation, NLRP1NLRP3 inflammasomes activation, proinflammatory cytokines production, and activations of NFB and MAPKs signaling pathways. Kaempferol prevented retina thickness change and RGC death in IR mice. The activations of caspase8, caspase3, and NLRP1NLRP3 inflammasome activation were inhibited by kaempferol. Kaempferol prevented proinflammatory cytokines productions in IR mice. The activation of NFB and JNK signaling pathways was also inhibited by Kaempferol in IR mice.

Here, we reexamined the origin of C2ST and its associations with Genghis Khan and Mongol populations. We analyzed 34 Ychromosome sequences of haplogroup C2ST and its most closely related lineage. We redefined this paternal lineage as C2b1a3a1F3796 and generated a highly revised phylogenetic tree of the haplogroup, including 36 sublineages and 265 nonprivate Ychromosome variants. We performed a comprehensive analysis and age estimation of this lineage in eastern Eurasia, including 18,210 individuals from 292 populations. We discovered that the origin of populations with high frequencies of C2ST can be traced to either an ancient Niru'un Mongol clan or ordinary Mongol tribes. Importantly, the age of the most recent common ancestor of C2ST (2576 years, 95% CI  19753178) and its sublineages, and their expansion patterns, are consistent with the diffusion of all Mongolicspeaking populations, rather than Genghis Khan himself or his close male relatives.

The modulated scattering technique is used in a wide range of frequencies up to millimeter waves for various applications, such as field mapping of circuits or antennas, radiofrequency identification devices and imaging applications. However, its implementation in the terahertz domain remains challenging. Here, we describe the design and experimental demonstration of the modulated scattering technique at terahertz frequencies. We characterize a modulated scatterer consisting in a bowtie antenna loaded with a vanadium dioxide switch, actuated using a continuous current. The modulated scatterer behavior is demonstrated using a time domain terahertz spectroscopy setup and shows significant signal strength well above 0.5 THz, which makes this device a promising candidate for the development of fast and energyefficient THz communication devices and imaging systems.

c2e8a18f51ab43c08ebec740a0bc7bae,Targeting PTPRZ inhibits stem celllike properties and tumorigenicity in glioblastoma cells,"The R5 subfamily of receptortype protein tyrosine phosphatases (RPTPs) comprises PTPRZ and PTPRG. A recent study on primary human glioblastomas suggested a close association between PTPRZ1 (human PTPRZ) expression and cancer stemness. However, the functional roles of PTPRZ activity in glioma stem cells have remained unclear. In the present study, we found that sphereforming cells from the rat C6 and human U251 glioblastoma cell lines showed high expression levels of PTPRZB, the short receptor isoform of PTPRZ. Stable PTPRZ knockdown altered the expression levels of stem cell transcription factors such as SOX2, OLIG2, and POU3F2 and decreased the sphereforming abilities of these cells. Suppressive effects on the cancer stemlike properties of the cells were also observed following the knockdown of PTPRG. Here, we identified NAZ2329, a cellpermeable small molecule that allosterically inhibits both PTPRZ and PTPRG. NAZ2329 reduced the expression of SOX2 in C6 and U251 cells and abrogated the sphereforming abilities of these cells. Tumor growth in the C6 xenograft mouse model was significantly slower with the cotreatment of NAZ2329 with temozolomide, an alkylating agent, than with the individual treatments. These results indicate that pharmacological inhibition of R5 RPTPs is a promising strategy for the treatment of malignant gliomas.",Akihiro Fujikawa; Hajime Sugawara; Taisaku Tanaka; Masahito Matsumoto; Kazuya Kuboyama; Ryoko Suzuki; Naomi Tanga; Atsuto Ogata; Makoto Masumura; Masaharu Noda,CNS cancer; Target validation,"Division of Molecular Neurobiology, National Institute for Basic Biology (NIBB), Okazaki, Japan; Asubio Pharma Co., Ltd., 643 MinatojimaMinamimachi, Hyogo, Japan; Asubio Pharma Co., Ltd., 643 MinatojimaMinamimachi, Hyogo, Japan; Division of Molecular Neurobiology, National Institute for Basic Biology (NIBB), Okazaki, Japan; Division of Molecular Neurobiology, National Institute for Basic Biology (NIBB), Okazaki, Japan; Division of Molecular Neurobiology, National Institute for Basic Biology (NIBB), Okazaki, Japan; Division of Molecular Neurobiology, National Institute for Basic Biology (NIBB), Okazaki, Japan; School of Life Science, The Graduate University for Advanced Studies (SOKENDAI), Okazaki, Japan; Asubio Pharma Co., Ltd., 643 MinatojimaMinamimachi, Hyogo, Japan; Asubio Pharma Co., Ltd., 643 MinatojimaMinamimachi, Hyogo, Japan; Division of Molecular Neurobiology, National Institute for Basic Biology (NIBB), Okazaki, Japan; School of Life Science, The Graduate University for Advanced Studies (SOKENDAI), Okazaki, Japan"
a5736d00b336412b9e98808ca5457be1,Systems genetics identifies a role for Cacna2d1 regulation in elevated intraocular pressure and glaucoma susceptibility,"Glaucoma is a multifactorial blinding disease in which genetic factors play an important role. Elevated intraocular pressure is a highly heritable risk factor for primary open angle glaucoma and currently the only target for glaucoma therapy. Our study helps to better understand underlying genetic and molecular mechanisms that regulate intraocular pressure, and identifies a new candidate gene, Cacna2d1, that modulates intraocular pressure and a promising therapeutic, pregabalin, which binds to CACNA2D1 protein and lowers intraocular pressure significantly. Because our study utilizes a genetically diverse population of mice with known sequence variants, we are able to determine that the intraocular pressurelowering effect of pregabalin is dependent on the Cacna2d1 haplotype. Using human genomewide association study (GWAS) data, evidence for association of a CACNA2D1 singlenucleotide polymorphism and primary open angle glaucoma is found. Importantly, these results demonstrate that our systems genetics approach represents an efficient method to identify genetic variation that can guide the selection of therapeutic targets. Elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) is a heritable risk factor for primary open angle glaucoma. Using forward mouse genetics, cell biology, pharmacology and human genetic data, the authors identify CACNA2D1 as an IOP risk gene that can be therapeutically targeted by the drug pregabalin in animal models.",Sumana R.

A prototype BICIS sample with pixel size of 1.2 m square containing 400 nm pitch IPAs shows 80% sensitivity enhancement at   850 nm compared to the reference sample with flat surface. This is due to diffraction with the IPA and total reflection at the pixel boundary.

22c6fdf5900840e3ab91f5c5acb37acb,A method for estimating intracellular ion concentration using optical nanosensors and ratiometric imaging,"Optical nanoparticle (NP)based sensors have been widely implemented as tools for detection of targeted ions and biomolecules. The NP sensing platform offer a modular design that can incorporate different sensing components for greater target specificity and the ability to tune the dynamic range, as well as encapsulation of multiple dyes to generate a ratiometric signal with varying spectra. Despite these advantages, demonstrating quantitative ion imaging for intracellular measurement still possess a major challenge. Here, we describe fundamentals that enable intracellular validation of this approach using ionselective nanosensors for investigating calcium (Ca2) as a model ion. While conventional indicators can improve individual aspects of indicator performance such as Kd, wavelength, and ratiometric measurements, the use of NP sensors can achieve combined benefits of addressing these issues simultaneously. The nanosensor incorporates highly calciumselective ionophores and two fluorescence indicators that act as signal transducers to facilitate quantitative ratiometric imaging. For intracellular Ca2 application, the sensors are finetuned to physiological sensing range, and livecell imaging and quantification are demonstrated in HeLa cells loaded with nanosensors and their responsiveness to carbacholevoked store release (~400 nM).

To date, no natural TCP degraders able to mineralize TCP aerobically have been isolated. In this work, we engineered a biosafety Pseudomonas putida strain KT2440 for aerobic mineralization of TCP by implantation of a synthetic biodegradation pathway into the chromosome and further improved TCP mineralization using combinatorial engineering strategies. Initially, a synthetic pathway composed of haloalkane dehalogenase, haloalcohol dehalogenase and epoxide hydrolase was functionally assembled for the conversion of TCP into glycerol in P. putida KT2440. Then, the growth lagphase of using glycerol as a growth precursor was eliminated by deleting the glpR gene, significantly enhancing the flux of carbon through the pathway. Subsequently, we improved the oxygen sequestering capacity of this strain through the heterologous expression of Vitreoscilla hemoglobin, which makes this strain able to mineralize TCP under oxygenlimited conditions. Lastly, we further improved intracellular energy charge (ATPADP ratio) and reducing power (NADPHNADP ratio) by deleting flagellarelated genes in the genome of P. putida KT2440. The resulting strain (named KTUTGVF) could efficiently utilize TCP as the sole source of carbon for growth.

Cardiac involvement is frequent and leads to lifethreatening cardiomyopathy. Besides the tissue alteration caused by fibrils, clinical and experimental evidence indicates that cardiac damage is also caused by proteotoxicity of prefibrillar amyloidogenic species. As in other amyloidoses, the damage mechanisms at cellular level are complex and largely undefined. We have characterized the molecular changes in primary human cardiac fibroblasts (hCFs) exposed in vitro to soluble amyloidogenic cardiotoxic LCs from AL cardiomyopathy patients. To evaluate proteome alterations caused by a representative cardiotropic LC, we combined gelbased with labelfree shotgun analysis and performed bioinformatics and data validation studies. To assess the generalizability of our results we explored the effects of multiple LCs on hCF viability and on levels of a subset of cellular proteins. Our results indicate that exposure of hCFs to cardiotropic LCs translates into proteome remodeling, associated with apoptosis activation and oxidative stress. The proteome alterations affect proteins involved in cytoskeletal organization, protein synthesis and quality control, mitochondrial activity and metabolism, signal transduction and molecular trafficking.

Analyses of Arabidopsis plants with transgenes encoding a microalgal polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) synthase revealed that small RNA (sRNA)mediated silencing, combined with the use of repetitive regulatory elements, led to aggressive transposonlike silencing of canolabiased PUFA synthase transgenes. Diversifying regulatory sequences and using native microalgal coding sequences (CDSs) with higher GC content improved transgene expression and resulted in a remarkable transgenerational stability via reduced accumulation of sRNAs and DNA methylation. Further experiments in maize with transgenes individually expressing three crystal (Cry) proteins from Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) tested the impact of CDS recoding using different codon bias tables. Transgenes with higher GC content exhibited increased transcript and protein accumulation. These results demonstrate that the sequence composition of transgene CDSs can directly impact silencing, providing design strategies for increasing transgene expression levels and reducing risks of heritable loss of transgene expression. The molecular basis underlying transgene susceptibility to silencing remains elusive. Now, using multiple examples, a study shows that higher GC content of coding sequences can reduce susceptibility of transgenes to heritable silencing.",Lyudmila V.

df8430d8f4f145c994c40e58a8429b69,An Intrinsic Role of Beta Oscillations in Memory for Time Estimation,"The neural mechanisms underlying time perception are of vital importance to a comprehensive understanding of behavior and cognition. Recent work has suggested a supramodal role for beta oscillations in measuring temporal intervals. However, the precise function of beta oscillations and whether their manipulation alters timing has yet to be determined. To accomplish this, we first reanalyzed two, separate EEG datasets and demonstrate that beta oscillations are associated with the retention and comparison of a memory standard for duration. We next conducted a study of 20 human participants using transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS), over frontocentral cortex, at alpha and beta frequencies, during a visual temporal bisection task, finding that beta stimulation exclusively shifts the perception of time such that stimuli are reported as longer in duration. Finally, we decomposed trialwise choice data with a drift diffusion model of timing, revealing that the shift in timing is caused by a change in the starting point of accumulation, rather than the drift rate or threshold. Our results provide evidence for the intrinsic involvement of beta oscillations in the perception of time, and point to a specific role for beta oscillations in the encoding and retention of memory for temporal intervals.",Martin Wiener; Alomi Parikh; Arielle Krakow; H.

EVs contain membrane and intraluminal proteins, affecting their structure and thereby likely their functioning. Here, we use atomic force microscopy for mechanical characterization of erythrocyte, or red blood cell (RBC), EVs from healthy individuals and from patients with hereditary spherocytosis (HS) due to ankyrin deficiency. While these EVs are packed with proteins, their response to indentation resembles that of fluid liposomes lacking proteins. The bending modulus of RBC EVs of healthy donors is ~15 kbT, similar to the RBC membrane. Surprisingly, whereas RBCs become more rigid in HS, patient EVs have a significantly (~40%) lower bending modulus than donor EVs. These results shed light on the mechanism and effects of EV budding and might explain the reported increase in vesiculation of RBCs in HS patients. Red blood cell disorders are often accompanied by increased release of extracellular vesicles (EVs), but their structural and mechanical properties are not fully understood. Here, the authors show that red blood cell EVs show liposomelike mechanical features and are softened in blood disorder patients.",Daan Vorselen; Susan M. van Dommelen; Raya Sorkin; Melissa C.

c80cbfba65ae4839ac0cec38cfdaaa51,Loss of KLHL6 promotes diffuse large Bcell lymphoma growth and survival by stabilizing the mRNA decay factor roquin2,"Kelchlike protein 6 (KLHL6) is an uncharacterized gene mutated in diffuse large Bcell lymphoma (DLBCL). Here we report that KLHL6 assembles with cullin3 to form a functional cullinRING ubiquitin ligase. Mutations in KLHL6 inhibit its ligase activity by disrupting the interaction with cullin3. Loss of KLHL6 favours DLBCL growth and survival both in vitro and in xenograft models. We further established that the mRNA decay factor roquin2 is a substrate of KLHL6. Degradation of roquin2 is dependent on Bcell receptor activation, and requires the integrity of the Tyr691 residue in roquin2 that is essential for its interaction with KLHL6. A nondegradable roquin2(Y691F) mutant requires its RNAbinding ability to phenocopy the effect of KLHL6 loss. Stabilization of roquin2 promotes mRNA decay of the tumour suppressor and NFB pathway inhibitor, tumour necrosis factorinducible gene 3. Collectively, our findings uncover the tumour suppressing mechanism of KLHL6. Choi et al. find that KLHL6, which is mutated in diffuse large Bcell lymphoma, is part of a ubiquitin ligase complex that targets the mRNA decay factor roquin2 for degradation and that loss of KLHL6 enhances cell survival through loss of TNFAIP3.",Jaewoo Choi; Kyutae Lee; Kristin Ingvarsdottir; Roberto Bonasio; Anita Saraf; Laurence Florens; Michael P.

The use of nanoparticles in healthcare is on the increase with silver being used in many devices. However, not all metallic nanoparticles can target and kill all diseasecausing bacteria. To overcome this, a combination of several different metallic nanoparticles were used in this study to compare effects of multiple metallic nanoparticles when in combination than when used singly, as single elemental nanoparticles (SENPs), against two common hospital acquired pathogens (Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas. aeruginosa). Flow cytometry LIVEDEAD assay was used to determine rates of cell death within a bacterial population when exposed to the nanoparticles. Results were analysed using linear models to compare effectiveness of three different metallic nanoparticles, tungsten carbide (WC), silver (Ag) and copper (Cu), in combination and separately. Results show that when the nanoparticles are placed in combination (NPCs), antimicrobial effects significantly increase than when compared with SENPs (P  0.01).

23d482ab2460417ea66d64b0e2cafdef,Estrogenrelated receptor gamma functions as a tumor suppressor in gastric cancer,"The principle factors underlying gastric cancer (GC) development and outcomes are not well characterized resulting in a paucity of validated therapeutic targets. To identify potential molecular targets, we analyze gene expression data from GC patients and identify the nuclear receptor ESRRG as a candidate tumor suppressor. ESRRG expression is decreased in GC and is a predictor of a poor clinical outcome. Importantly, ESRRG suppresses GC cell growth and tumorigenesis. Gene expression profiling suggests that ESRRG antagonizes Wnt signaling via the suppression of TCF4LEF1 binding to the CCND1 promoter. Indeed, ESRRG levels are found to be inversely correlated with Wnt signalingassociated genes in GC patients. Strikingly, the ESRRG agonist DY131 suppresses cancer growth and represses the expression of Wnt signaling genes. Our present findings thus demonstrate that ESRRG functions as a negative regulator of the Wnt signaling pathway in GC and is a potential therapeutic target for this cancer. Very little is known regarding the molecular mechanisms involved in gastric cancer development. Here the authors show estrogenrelated receptor gamma (ESRRG) is a tumor suppressor in gastric cancer and suggest the mechanism of this tumor suppression function involves the inhibition of Wnt signaling.",MyoungHee Kang; Hyunji Choi; Masanobu Oshima; JaeHo Cheong; Seokho Kim; Jung Hoon Lee; Young Soo Park; HuengSik Choi; MiNa Kweon; ChanGi Pack; JuSeog Lee; Gordon B.

452e0b5c4f784499ab8fd2d83db66d58,USP7 deubiquitinates and stabilizes NOTCH1 in Tcell acute lymphoblastic leukemia,"Tcell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (TALL) is a highly aggressive leukemia that is primarily caused by aberrant activation of the NOTCH1 signaling pathway. Recent studies have revealed that posttranslational modifications, such as ubiquitination, regulate NOTCH1 stability, activity, and localization. However, the specific deubiquitinase that affects NOTCH1 protein stability remains unestablished. Here, we report that ubiquitinspecific protease 7 (USP7) can stabilize NOTCH1. USP7 deubiquitinated NOTCH1 in vivo and in vitro, whereas knockdown of USP7 increased the ubiquitination of NOTCH1. USP7 interacted with NOTCH1 protein in TALL cells, and the MATH and UBL domains of USP7 were responsible for this interaction. Depletion of USP7 significantly suppressed the proliferation of TALL cells in vitro and in vivo, accompanied by downregulation of the NOTCH1 protein level. Similarly, pharmacologic inhibition of USP7 led to apoptosis of TALL cells. More importantly, we found that USP7 was significantly upregulated in human TALL cell lines and patient samples, and a USP7 inhibitor exhibited cell cytotoxicity toward primary TALL cells, indicating the clinical relevance of these findings. Overall, our results demonstrate that USP7 is a novel deubiquitinase that stabilizes NOTCH1. Therefore, USP7 may be a promising therapeutic target in the currently incurable TALL. Inhibiting the protein ubiquitinspecific protease 7 (USP7) may offer a treatment option for patients with Tcell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (TALL), an incurable and aggressive cancer. TALL is primarily caused by aberrant activation of the protein NOTCH1, which regulates gene expression relating to cell survival, proliferation, and metastasis. YingLi Wu, from China's Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, and a team of researchers report that, in their experiments, USP7 prevented the breakdown of NOTCH1 by removing the protein tag that would normally signal it for degradation. In addition, USP7 expression was upregulated in all human TALL cells and samples tested. Inhibition of USP7 suppressed the proliferation of TALL cells in vitro and in vivo. These results reveal the role of USP7 in the pathophysiology of TALL and offer USP7 as a promising potential therapeutic target.",Huizhuang Shan; Xiangyun Li; Xinhua Xiao; Yuting Dai; Jinyan Huang; Junjun Song; Meng Liu; Li Yang; Hu Lei; Yin Tong; Li Zhou; Hanzhang Xu; Yingli Wu,Haematological cancer,"Hongqiao International Institute of Medicine, Shanghai Tongren HospitalFaculty of Basic Medicine, Chemical Biology Division of Shanghai Universities EInstitutes, Key Laboratory of Cell Differentiation and Apoptosis of the Chinese Ministry of Education, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China; Hongqiao International Institute of Medicine, Shanghai Tongren HospitalFaculty of Basic Medicine, Chemical Biology Division of Shanghai Universities EInstitutes, Key Laboratory of Cell Differentiation and Apoptosis of the Chinese Ministry of Education, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China; Department of Hematology, RuiJin Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China; Department of Hematology, RuiJin Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China; Department of Hematology, RuiJin Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China; Shanghai University of Medicine  Health Sciences, Shanghai, China; Hongqiao International Institute of Medicine, Shanghai Tongren HospitalFaculty of Basic Medicine, Chemical Biology Division of Shanghai Universities EInstitutes, Key Laboratory of Cell Differentiation and Apoptosis of the Chinese Ministry of Education, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China; Hongqiao International Institute of Medicine, Shanghai Tongren HospitalFaculty of Basic Medicine, Chemical Biology Division of Shanghai Universities EInstitutes, Key Laboratory of Cell Differentiation and Apoptosis of the Chinese Ministry of Education, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China; Hongqiao International Institute of Medicine, Shanghai Tongren HospitalFaculty of Basic Medicine, Chemical Biology Division of Shanghai Universities EInstitutes, Key Laboratory of Cell Differentiation and Apoptosis of the Chinese Ministry of Education, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China; Department of Hematology, Shanghai First People's Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China; Department of Hematology, RuiJin Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China; Hongqiao International Institute of Medicine, Shanghai Tongren HospitalFaculty of Basic Medicine, Chemical Biology Division of Shanghai Universities EInstitutes, Key Laboratory of Cell Differentiation and Apoptosis of the Chinese Ministry of Education, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China; Hongqiao International Institute of Medicine, Shanghai Tongren HospitalFaculty of Basic Medicine, Chemical Biology Division of Shanghai Universities EInstitutes, Key Laboratory of Cell Differentiation and Apoptosis of the Chinese Ministry of Education, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China"

Peptoids are peptidomimetic oligomers with the capability to inhibit proteinprotein interactions by mimicking protein secondary structure motifs. Here we report the in silico design of a macrocycle primarily composed of peptoid subunits that targets the catenin:TCF interaction. The catenin:TCF interaction plays a critical role in the Wnt signaling pathway which is overactivated in multiple cancers, including prostate cancer. Using the Rosetta suite of protein design algorithms, we evaluate how different macrocycle structures can bind a pocket on catenin that associates with TCF. The in silico designed macrocycles are screened in vitro using luciferase reporters to identify promising compounds. The most active macrocycle inhibits both Wnt and ARsignaling in prostate cancer cell lines, and markedly diminishes their proliferation. In vivo potential is demonstrated through a zebrafish model, in which Wnt signaling is potently inhibited.

Detailed Xray measurements have been performed in order to investigate strain relaxation and inplane strain distribution. The study has been compared with the standard nonpolar GaN grown without any patterning processes and an extra nonpolar GaN sample overgrown on a standard stripepatterned template. The standard nonpolar GaN grown without involving any patterning processes typically exhibits highly anisotropic inplane strain distribution, while the overgrown GaN on our regularly arrayed microrod templates shows a highly isotropic inplane strain distribution. Between them is the overgrown nonpolar GaN on the stripepatterned template.

The hepatitis B virus X (HBx) protein has been reported to be closely associated with hepatocarcinogenesis. Meanwhile, emerging evidence has indicated that long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are involved in the pathogenesis and progression of cancers. Our previous investigation has demonstrated that HBx could promote HCC by regulating the expression levels of various lncRNAs. In this study, we identified an lncRNA, lncRNATCONS_00006195 (termed lncRNA6195), which was downregulated in HBVrelated HCC tissues compared with its expression in adjacent noncancerous hepatic tissues. Clinical data showed that a low level of lncRNA6195 was correlated with a high EdmondsonSteiner grade of the tumor and a poor prognosis in HCC patients. Furthermore, lncRNA6195 acted as a tumor repressor in the development of hepatitis Brelated HCC, inhibiting HCC cell proliferation in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, lncRNA6195 could combine with enolase (ENO1) and repress its enzymatic activity, thus further inhibiting the energy metabolism in HCC cells. Our results suggest that lncRNA6195 represses the growth of HCC by inhibiting the enzymatic activity of ENO1.

b07d015ca59b41918fdbb0725c6a0195,SIRT7 has a critical role in bone formation by regulating lysine acylation of SP7Osterix,"SP7Osterix (OSX) is a master regulatory transcription factor that activates a variety of genes during differentiation of osteoblasts. However, the influence of posttranslational modifications on the regulation of its transactivation activity is largely unknown. Here, we report that sirtuins, which are NAD()dependent deacylases, regulate lysine deacylationmediated transactivation of OSX. Germline Sirt7 knockout mice develop severe osteopenia characterized by decreased bone formation and an increase of osteoclasts. Similarly, osteoblastspecific Sirt7 knockout mice showed attenuated bone formation. Interaction of SIRT7 with OSX leads to the activation of transactivation by OSX without altering its protein expression. Deacylation of lysine (K) 368 in the Cterminal region of OSX by SIRT7 promote its Nterminal transactivation activity. In addition, SIRT7mediated deacylation of K368 also facilitates depropionylation of OSX by SIRT1, thereby increasing OSX transactivation activity. In conclusion, our findings suggest that SIRT7 has a critical role in bone formation by regulating acylation of OSX. SP7Osterix is a transcription factor involved in osteoblast differentiation. Here, the authors show that Sirtuin 7 activates Osterix posttranslationally by regulating its lysine acylation, and that mice lacking Sirtuin 7 in osteoblasts show reduced bone formation.",Masatoshi Fukuda; Tatsuya Yoshizawa; Md.

Modelocked fiber lasers working in soliton and stretchedpulse regime outperform others in terms of the laser noise characteristics, mechanical stability and easy maintenance. However, conventional optical fibers always show a normal group velocity dispersion around 1 m, leading to the inconvenience for necessary dispersion management. Here we show that optical microfibers having a large anomalous dispersion around 1 m can be integrated into modelocked Ybdoped fiber lasers with ultralow insertion loss down to 0.06 dB, enabling convenient dispersion management of the laser cavity. Besides, optical microfibers could also be adopted to spectrally broaden and to dechirp the ultrashort pulses outside the laser cavity, giving rise to a pulse duration of about 110 fs. We believe that this demonstration may facilitate allfiber format highperformance ultrashort pulse generation at 1 m and may find applications in precision measurements, largescale facility synchronization and evanescentfieldbased optical sensing.",Lizhen Wang; Peizhen Xu; Yuhang Li; Jize Han; Xin Guo; Yudong Cui; Xueming Liu; Limin Tong,Fibre lasers; Ultrafast lasers,"State Key Laboratory of Modern Optical Instrumentation, College of Optical Science and Engineering, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China; State Key Laboratory of Modern Optical Instrumentation, College of Optical Science and Engineering, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China; State Key Laboratory of Precision Measurement Technology and Instruments, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China; Department of Physics, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China; State Key Laboratory of Modern Optical Instrumentation, College of Optical Science and Engineering, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China; State Key Laboratory of Modern Optical Instrumentation, College of Optical Science and Engineering, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China; State Key Laboratory of Modern Optical Instrumentation, College of Optical Science and Engineering, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China; State Key Laboratory of Modern Optical Instrumentation, College of Optical Science and Engineering, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China"
4d0f4ea82e7946d9b3ad65b0ceaca718,Towards precision medicine for pain: diagnostic biomarkers and repurposed drugs,"We endeavored to identify objective blood biomarkers for pain, a subjective sensation with a biological basis, using a stepwise discovery, prioritization, validation, and testing in independent cohorts design. We studied psychiatric patients, a high risk group for comorbid pain disorders and increased perception of pain. For discovery, we used a powerful withinsubject longitudinal design. We were successful in identifying blood gene expression biomarkers that were predictive of pain state, and of future emergency department (ED) visits for pain, more so when personalized by gender and diagnosis. MFAP3, which had no prior evidence in the literature for involvement in pain, had the most robust empirical evidence from our discovery and validation steps, and was a strong predictor for pain in the independent cohorts, particularly in females and males with PTSD. Other biomarkers with best overall convergent functional evidence for involvement in pain were GNG7, CNTN1, LY9, CCDC144B, and GBP1. Some of the individual biomarkers identified are targets of existing drugs. Moreover, the biomarker gene expression signatures were used for bioinformatic drug repurposing analyses, yielding leads for possible new drug candidates such as SC560 (an NSAID), and amoxapine (an antidepressant), as well as natural compounds such as pyridoxine (vitamin B6), cyanocobalamin (vitamin B12), and apigenin (a plant flavonoid).

Under normal conditions, heterogeneous nucleation mechanisms critically prohibit the simultaneous longterm ( 1 week), large volume ( 1 ml), and low temperatures ( 10 C) supercooling of aqueous solutions. Here, we report on the use of surface sealing of water by an oil phase to significantly diminish the primary heterogeneous nucleation at the waterair interface. We achieve deep supercooling (down to 20 C) of large volumes of water (up to 100 ml) for long periods (up to 100 days) simultaneously via this approach. Since oils are mixtures of various hydrocarbons we also report on the use of pure alkanes and primary alcohols of various lengths to achieve the same. Furthermore, we demonstrate the utility of deep supercooling via preliminary studies on extended (100 days) preservation of human red blood cells. Supercooled water is susceptible to spontaneous freezing, and preventing this process is a challenge. Here, the authors use surface sealing with immiscible liquids to eliminate primary ice nucleation at the waterair interface, enabling deep supercooling of large volumes of water and red cell suspensions for long time periods.",Haishui Huang; Martin L.

d5cb29bbda784d6aba5572c5d76dd2d6,Sensitivity of Colorectal Cancer to Arginine Deprivation Therapy is Shaped by Differential Expression of Urea Cycle Enzymes,"Tumors deficient in the urea cycle enzymes argininosuccinate synthase1 (ASS1) and ornithine transcarbamylase (OTC) are unable to synthesize arginine and can be targeted using argininedeprivation therapy. Here, we show that colorectal cancers (CRCs) display negligible expression of OTC and, in subset of cases, ASS1 proteins. CRC cells fail to grow in argininefree medium and dietary arginine deprivation slows growth of cancer cells implanted into immunocompromised mice. Moreover, we report that clinicallyformulated argininedegrading enzymes are effective anticancer drugs in CRC. Pegylated arginine deiminase (ADIPEG20), which degrades arginine to citrulline and ammonia, affects growth of ASS1negative cells, whereas recombinant human arginase1 (rhArg1peg5000), which degrades arginine into urea and ornithine, is effective against a broad spectrum of OTCnegative CRC cell lines. This reflects the inability of CRC cells to recycle citrulline and ornithine into the urea cycle. Finally, we show that arginase antagonizes chemotherapeutic drugs oxaliplatin and 5fluorouracil (5FU), whereas ADIPEG20 synergizes with oxaliplatin in ASS1negative cell lines and appears to interact with 5fluorouracil independently of ASS1 status. Overall, we conclude that CRC is amenable to argininedeprivation therapy, but we warrant caution when combining arginine deprivation with standard chemotherapy.",Constantinos Alexandrou; Saif Sattar AlAqbi; Jennifer A.

Here we demonstrate the production of DNAdetonation nanodiamond (DNADND) conjugates with high dispersion and solubility using an ultrasonic, mixedsilanization chemistry protocol based on the in situ BeadAssisted Sonication Disintegration (BASD) silanization method. We use two silanes to achieve these properties: (1) 3(trihydroxysilyl)propyl methylphosphonate (THPMP); a negatively charged silane that imparts high zeta potential and solubility in solution; and (2) (3aminopropyl)triethoxysilane (APTES); a commonly used functional silane that contributes an amino group for subsequent bioconjugation. We target these amino groups for covalent conjugation to thiolated, singlestranded DNA oligomers using the heterobifunctional crosslinker sulfosuccinimidyl 4(Nmaleimidomethyl)cyclohexane1carboxylate (SulfoSMCC). The resulting DNADND conjugates are the smallest reported to date, as determined by Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS) and Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM).

Here we report proofofconcept for a platform called polyligand profiling (PLP) that surveys these system states and distinguishes breast cancer patients who did or did not derive benefit from trastuzumab. We perform tissueSELEX on breast cancer specimens to enrich singlestranded DNA (ssDNA) libraries that preferentially interact with molecular components associated with the two clinical phenotypes. Testing of independent sample sets verifies the ability of PLP to classify trastuzumabtreated patients according to their clinical outcomes with ROCAUC of 0.78. Standard HER2 testing of the same patients gives a ROCAUC of 0.47. KaplanMeier analysis reveals a median increase in benefit from trastuzumabcontaining treatments of 300 days for PLPpositive compared to PLPnegative patients. If prospectively validated, PLP may increase success rates in precision oncology and clinical trials, thus improving both patient care and drug development.

The mucosaassociated lymphoid tissue (MALT) is significantly disarrayed during HIV infection. Compositional changes in the gut microbiota might contribute to the mucosal barrier disruption, and consequently to microbial translocation. We performed an observational, crosssectional study aimed at evaluating changes in the fecal microbiota of HIVinfected individuals from Colombia. We analyzed the fecal microbiota of 37 individuals via 16S rRNA gene sequencing; 25 HIVinfected patients and 12 control (noninfected) individuals, which were similar in body mass index, age, gender balance and socioeconomic status. To the best of our knowledge, no such studies have been conducted in Latin American countries. Given its compositional nature, microbiota data were normalized and transformed using Aitchison's Centered LogRatio. Overall, a change in the network structure in HIVinfected patients was revealed by using the SPIECEASI MB tool. Genera such as Blautia, Dorea, Yersinia, EscherichiaShigella complex, Staphylococcus, and Bacteroides were highly relevant in HIVinfected individuals. Differential abundance analysis by both sparse Partial Least SquareDiscriminant Analysis and Random Forest identified a greater abundance of LachnospiraceaeOTU69, Blautia, Dorea, Roseburia, and Erysipelotrichaceae in HIVinfected individuals.

We identified the first de novo variant in KCNMA1 (c.2984 A  G (p.(N995S)))encoding the BK channelthat causes epilepsy, but not paroxysmal dyskinesia, in two independent families. The c.2984 A  G (p.(N995S)) variant markedly increased the macroscopic potassium current by increasing both the channel open probability and channel open dwell time. The c.2984 A  G (p.(N995S)) variant did not affect the calcium sensitivity of the channel. We also identified three other variants of unknown significance (c.1554 G  T (p.(K518N)), c.1967A  C (p.(E656A)), and c.3476 A  G (p.(N1159S))) in three separate patients with divergent epileptic phenotypes. However, these variants did not affect the BK potassium current, and are therefore unlikely to be diseasecausing. These results demonstrate that BK channel variants can cause epilepsy without paroxysmal dyskinesia. The underlying molecular mechanism can be increased activation of the BK channel by increased sensitivity to the voltagedependent activation without affecting the sensitivity to the calciumdependent activation. Our data suggest that the BK channel may represent a drug target for the treatment of epilepsy. Our data highlight the importance of functional electrophysiological studies of BK channel variants in distinguishing whether a genomic variant of unknown significance is a diseasecausing variant or a benign variant.",Xia Li; Sibylle Poschmann; Qiuyun Chen; Walid Fazeli; Nelly Jouayed Oundjian; Francesca M.

Many stresses, such as infectioninflammation, reactive oxygen species, nutritional deprivation and hypoxia, activate unfolded protein response signalling, which induces either adaptive changes to resolve the stress or apoptosis to clear the damaged cell. Whether unfoldedproteinresponse signalling plays any role in HSC regulation remains to be established. Here, we report that the adaptive signalling of the unfolded protein response, IRE1XBP1, protects HSCs from endoplasmic reticulum stressinduced apoptosis. IRE1 knockout leads to reduced reconstitution of HSCs. Furthermore, we show that oncogenic NRasG12D activates IRE1XBP1, through MEKGSK3, to promote HSC survival under endoplasmic reticulum stress. Inhibiting IRE1XBP1 abolished NRasG12Dmediated survival under endoplasmic reticulum stress and diminished the competitive advantage of NrasG12D HSCs in transplant recipients. Our studies illuminate how the adaptive endoplasmic reticulum stress response is advantageous in sustaining selfrenewal of HSCs and promoting preleukaemic clonal dominance.

Diverse microRNAs (miRNAs) have been shown to appear in the bloodstream following various cardiovascular events. The aim of this study was to identify prognostic miRNAs associated with LV dysfunction following AMI. Patients were divided into subgroups comprising patients who developed or not LV dysfunction within six months of the infarction. miRNA profiles were determined in plasma and serum samples of the patients on the first day of AMI. Levels of 14 plasma miRNAs and 16 serum miRNAs were significantly different in samples from AMI patients who later developed LV dysfunction compared to those who did not. Two miRNAs were upregulated in both types of material. Validation in an independent group of patients, using droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) confirmed that miR30a5p was significantly elevated on admission in those patients who developed LV dysfunction and HF symptoms six months after AMI. A bioinformatics analysis indicated that miR30a5p may regulate genes involved in cardiovascular pathogenesis.

DNA breaks at specific sites activate local DNA repair and recombination, including recombination with ectopic sequences leading to GT. Largescale transformation with the repair template can be avoided by preinsertion of the repair template in the genome and liberation by sequencespecific nucleases (in planta GT procedure). Here, we tested whether release of the repair template was required for GT. Plants were transformed with constructs encoding a CRISPRCas nuclease with a recognition site in the endogenous PPO gene and a repair template harboring a 5 truncated PPO gene with two amino acid substitutions rendering the enzyme insensitive to the herbicide butafenacil. Selection resulted in socalled true GT events, repaired via homologous recombination at both ends of the gene and transmitted to the next generation. As the template was surrounded by geminiviral LIR sequences, we also tested whether replication of the template could be induced by crossingin an integrated geminivirus REP gene. However, we could not find evidence for repair template replication by REP and we obtained similar numbers of GT events in these plants. Thus, GT is possible without any further processing of the preinserted repair template.",Sylvia de Pater; Bart J. P. M. Klemann; Paul J. J.

Inhibition of RIP1 reduced collagen antibodyinduced arthritis, and prevented skin inflammation caused by mutation of Sharpin, or colitis caused by deletion of Nemo from intestinal epithelial cells. Conversely, inhibition of RIP1 had no effect on tumor growth or survival in pancreatic tumor models driven by mutant Kras, nor did it reduce lung metastases in a B16 melanoma model.

We test a counterintuitive hypothesis about the function of iridescence: that it can act as camouflage through interference with object recognition. Using an established insect visual model (Bombus terrestris), we demonstrate that both diffraction grating and multilayer iridescence impair shape recognition (although not the more subtle form of diffraction grating seen in some flowers), supporting the idea that both strategies can be effective means of camouflage. We conclude that iridescence produces visual signals that can confuse potential predators, and this might explain the high frequency of iridescence in many animal taxa.",Karin Kjernsmo; Joanna R.

New insights into the pathophysiology of schizophrenia are needed to provide the conceptual framework to facilitate development of new treatment strategies. We examined bioenergetic pathways in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) of subjects with schizophrenia and control subjects using western blot analysis, quantitative realtime polymerase chain reaction, and enzymesubstrate assays. Lasercapture microdissectionquantitative polymerase chain reaction was used to examine these pathways at the cellular level. We found decreases in hexokinase (HXK) and phosphofructokinase (PFK) activity in the DLPFC, as well as decreased PFK1 mRNA expression. In pyramidal neurons, we found an increase in monocarboxylate transporter 1 mRNA expression, and decreases in HXK1, PFK1, glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1), and GLUT3 mRNA expression. These results suggest abnormal bioenergetic function, as well as a neuronspecific defect in glucose utilization, in the DLPFC in schizophrenia.",Courtney R. Sullivan; Rachael H.

In the current study, we used a distributed lag nonlinear model (DLNM) to analyze a 10year series of consecutive surveillance data. We found that, after effectively controlling for autocorrelation, the changes in meteorological factors related to temperature, humidity, wind and sunshine were significantly associated with subsequent fluctuations in TB incidence: average temperature was inversely associated with TB incidence at a lag period of 2 months; total precipitation and minimum relative humidity were also inversely associated with TB incidence at lag periods of 3 and 4 months, respectively; average wind velocity and total sunshine hours exhibited an instant rather than lagged influence on TB incidence. Our study results suggest that preceding meteorological factors may have a noticeable effect on future TB incidence; informed prevention and preparedness measures for TB can therefore be constructed on the basis of meteorological variations.",Yuanyuan Xiao; Limei He; Ying Chen; Qinying Wang; Qiong Meng; Wei Chang; Lifen Xiong; Zhen Yu,Epidemiology; Tuberculosis,"Department of Epidemiology and Health Statistics, School of Public Health, Kunming Medical University, Kunming, China; Department of Epidemiology and Health Statistics, School of Public Health, Kunming Medical University, Kunming, China; Department of Epidemiology and Health Statistics, School of Public Health, Kunming Medical University, Kunming, China; Division of Chronic Infectious Disease Prevention and Control, Jinghong Municipal Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Jinghong, China; Department of Epidemiology and Health Statistics, School of Public Health, Kunming Medical University, Kunming, China; Department of Epidemiology and Health Statistics, School of Public Health, Kunming Medical University, Kunming, China; Division of Chronic Infectious Disease Prevention and Control, Xishuangbanna Prefectural Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Jinghong, China; Department of Epidemiology and Health Statistics, School of Public Health, Kunming Medical University, Kunming, China"

After its domestication in Neotropical America, human migration led to the distribution of the sweet potato plant throughout the world. Both leaf and storage root are high in compounds of nutritional value. Yet, the storage roots are of particular value due to their significant content of provitamin A (carotene). The breeding effort for elite sweet potato lines led to the reduction of genetic diversity and the potential to improve other traits. The focus of the present study was to assess the metabolic diversity of 27 sweet potato cultivars including landraces and improved varieties. A metabolite profiling approach was optimised for sweet potato leaf and storage root tissue and 130 metabolites identified with three different analysis platforms. The data highlighted a lack of correlation between storage root phenotype and leaf metabolism. Furthermore, the metabolic diversity of storage roots was based on the secondary metabolism, including phenylpropanoids and carotenoids. Three cultivars of three different flesh colouration (yellow, orange and purple) showed a significant difference of the primary metabolism. This data demonstrates the value of metabolite profiling to breeding programs as a means of identifying differences in phenotypeschemotypes and characterising parental material for future prebreeding resources. Understanding the metabolic variations of different types of sweet potato could help improve their nutritional value. Sweet potato is one of the world's major food crops but recurrent breeding of high yielding lines is reducing their genetic diversity. A study led by Paul D. Fraser, Royal Holloway University of London, UK, examined the chemical differences between 25 types of sweet potato, including orange and purple varieties. They show that there is little correlation between the chemicals found in the leaves and storage root material and that there are significant differences in metabolism between varieties that produce different pigments in their storage roots. Their findings highlight the importance of metabolite profiling for identifying those varieties that produce the highest levels of starch and healthpromoting compounds such as carotenoids.",Margit Drapal; Genoveva Rossel; Bettina Heider; Paul D.

Here, we identified NMDA receptors containing the 2A subunit (GluN2A) on parvalbumin (PV)expressing inhibitory interneurons as a pivotal target of lowdose ketamine. Genetically deleting GluN2A receptors globally or selectively from PV interneurons abolished the rapid enhancement of visual cortical responses and gammaband oscillations by ketamine. Moreover, during the follicular phase of the estrous cycle in female mice, the ketamine response was transiently attenuated along with a concomitant decrease of grin2A mRNA expression within PV interneurons. Thus, GluN2A receptors on PV interneurons mediate the immediate actions of lowdose ketamine treatment, and fluctuations in receptor expression across the estrous cycle may underlie sexdifferences in drug efficacy.",Nathalie Picard; Anne E.

Thus, we investigated the toxic effects of tribenuronmethyl (TBM) and tebuconazole (TEB) on the soil earthworm, Eisenia fetida. The TBM demonstrated low toxicity to E. fetida in the contact filter paper and artificial soil tests, with median lethal concentrations (LC50) of 135.6 g cm2 at 48 h and 511 mg kg1 on day 14, respectively. Similarly, TEB also showed low toxicity to E. fetida in the artificial soil test with LC50 of 287 mg kg1 on day 14. However, TEB was highly toxic to earthworm in the contact filter paper test with LC50 of 5.7 g cm2 at 48 h. The mixture of two pesticides had an antagonistic effect on the earthworm. Under 0.1 LC50 of TBM and TEB, either single or combined application of pesticides induced oxidative stress and inhibited cellulase activity in early days of the earthworm exposure. However, both pesticides did not damage the earthworm DNA.

By replacing commonly used chemical surfactants with biosurfactant, reverse micelle extraction can be further improved in terms of environmental friendliness and sustainability. A central composite experimental design was used to investigate the effects of solution pH, KCl concentration, and sophorolipids concentration on the reverse micelle extraction of antibiotics. The most significant factor identified during the reverse micelle extraction of both antibiotics is the pH of aqueous solutions. Best forward extraction performance for erythromycin was found at feed phase pH of approximately 8.0 with low KCl and sophorolipids concentrations. Optimum recovery of erythromycin was obtained at stripping phase pH around 10.0 and with low KCl concentration. On the other hand, best forward extraction performance for amoxicillin was found at feed phase pH around 3.5 with low KCl concentration and high sophorolipids concentration. Optimum recovery of erythromycin was obtained at stripping phase pH around 6.0 with low KCl concentration.

While reduced RecQ4 activity is associated with cancer predisposition and premature aging, RecQ4 upregulation is related to carcinogenesis and metastasis. Within the RecQ family, RecQ4 assumes an exceptional position, lacking several characteristic RecQ domains. Here we present the crystal structure of human RecQ4, encompassing the conserved ATPase core and a novel Cterminal domain that lacks resemblance to the RQC domain observed in other RecQ helicases. The new domain features a zincbinding site and two distinct types of wingedhelix domains, which are not involved in canonical DNA binding or helicase activity. Based on our structural and functional analysis, we propose that RecQ4 exerts a helicase mechanism, which may be more closely related to bacterial RecQ helicases than to its human family members.

We explored bumblebees' route development on an array of five artificial flowers in which minimising travel distances between individual feeders conflicted with minimising overall distance. No previous study of bee spatial navigation has been able to follow animals' movement during learning; we tracked bumblebee foragers continuously, using harmonic radar, and examined the process of route formation in detail for a small number of selected individuals. On our array, bees did not settle on visit sequences that gave the shortest overall path, but prioritised movements to nearby feeders. Nonetheless, flight distance and duration reduced with experience. This increased efficiency was attributable mainly to experienced bees reducing exploration beyond the feeder array and flights becoming straighter with experience, rather than improvements in the sequence of feeder visits. Flight paths of all legs of a flight stabilised at similar rates, whereas the first few feeder visits became fixed early while bees continued to experiment with the order of later visits. Stabilising early sections of a route and prioritising travel between nearby destinations may reduce the search space, allowing rapid adoption of efficient routes.",Joseph L. Woodgate; James C.

ae4fb9a1c05d41ceb10c04e063f3ee85,Identification of regenerative roadblocks via repeat deployment of limb regeneration in axolotls,"Axolotl salamanders are powerful models for understanding how regeneration of complex body parts can be achieved, whereas mammals are severely limited in this ability. Factors that promote normal axolotl regeneration can be examined in mammals to determine if they exhibit altered activity in this context. Furthermore, factors prohibiting axolotl regeneration can offer key insight into the mechanisms present in regenerationincompetent species. We sought to determine if we could experimentally compromise the axolotl's ability to regenerate limbs and, if so, discover the molecular changes that might underlie their inability to regenerate. We found that repeated limb amputation severely compromised axolotls' ability to initiate limb regeneration. Using RNAseq, we observed that a majority of differentially expressed transcripts were hyperactivated in limbs compromised by repeated amputation, suggesting that misregulation of these genes antagonizes regeneration. To confirm our findings, we additionally assayed the role of amphiregulin, an EGFlike ligand, which is aberrantly upregulated in compromised animals. During normal limb regeneration, amphiregulin is expressed by the early wound epidermis, and misexpressing this factor lead to thickened wound epithelium, delayed initiation of regeneration, and severe regenerative defects. Collectively, our results suggest that repeatedly amputated limbs may undergo a persistent wound healing response, which interferes with their ability to initiate the regenerative program. These findings have important implications for human regenerative medicine. Understanding a roadblock to limb regeneration in salamanders could help develop suitable regenerative therapies for humans. Jessica Whited of the Harvard Stem Cell Institute and colleagues in the US found that repeatedly amputating a limb in Mexican salamanders compromised their normal ability to regenerate it. The team found high levels of a gene encoding a damageprotecting protein, called amphiregulin, at the wound site. Artificially inducing the expression of this gene in salamanders whose limbs were amputated just once also led to slow and poor regeneration. The findings suggest that high levels of amphiregulin induce a persistent woundhealing response that interferes with the salamanders' ability to initiate regeneration. Pushing organisms with strong regenerative abilities into a nonregenerative state can help researchers understand the factors that limit human regenerative abilities and thus develop suitable therapies.",Donald M.

Such a picture is typically adopted in the investigation of traditional Cherenkov radiation as well as its counterparts in different branches of physics, including nonlinear optics, spintronics and plasmonics. In these cases, the radiation emitted spreads along a ""cone"", making it impractical for most applications. Here, we employ a selfaccelerating optical pump wavepacket to demonstrate controlled shaping of one type of generalized Cherenkov radiation  dispersive waves in optical fibers.

996c2ca52a0d4f1c80beb16c888d7c90,Two approaches reveal a new paradigm of 'switchable or geneticsinfluenced allelespecific DNA methylation' with potential in human disease,"Imprinted genes are vulnerable to environmental influences during early embryonic development, thereby contributing to the onset of disease in adulthood. Monoallelic methylation at several germline imprints has been reported as DNMT1dependent. However, which of these two epigenetic attributes, DNMT1dependence or allelic methylation, renders imprinted genes susceptible to environmental stressors has not been determined. Herein, we developed a new approach, referred to as NORED, to identify 2468 DNMT1dependent DNA methylation patterns in the mouse genome. We further developed an algorithm based on a genetic variationindependent approach (referred to as MethylMosaic) to detect 2487 regions with bimodal methylation patterns. Two approaches identified 207 regions, including known imprinted germline allelespecific methylation patterns (ASMs), that were both NORED and MethylMosaic regions. Examination of methylation in four independent mouse embryonic stem cell lines shows that two regions identified by both NORED and MethylMosaic (Hcn2 and Park7) did not display parentoforigindependent allelic methylation. In these four F1 hybrid cell lines, genetic variation in Cast allele at Hcn2 locus introduces a transcription factor binding site for MTF1 that may predispose Cast allelic hypomethylation in a reciprocal cross with either C57 or 129 strains. In contrast, each allele of Hcn2 ASM in J1 inbred cell line and Park7 ASM in four F1 hybrid cell lines seems to exhibit similar propensity to be either hypo or hypermethylated, suggesting a 'random, switchable' ASM. Together with published results, our data on ASMs prompted us to propose a hypothesis of regional 'autosomal chromosome inactivation (ACI)' that may control a subset of autosomal genes.

Our goal was to develop a new theory that provides a computationally effective approach to this problem. In this paper a quasiparticle theory of a diffusional selforganisation of atoms in continuum space during the diffusional time scale has been introduced. This became possible due to two novelties, a concept of quasiparticles, fratons, used for a description of dynamic degrees of freedom and model Hamiltonian taking into account a directionality, length and strength of interatomic bonds. To illustrate a predictive power and achievable level of complexity of selfassembled structures, the challenging cases of selfassembling of the diamond, zincblende, helix and doublehelix structures, from a random atomic distribution, have been successfully modelled. This approach opens a way to model a selfassembling of complex atomic and molecular structures in the atomic scale during diffusional time. Researchers in France and the US have demonstrated a new approach to modeling the selfassembly of atoms in complex structures. The oftenused molecular dynamics simulation is not well suited to the slow speed of diffusion and the resulting slowly evolving nature of selfassembly processes, and Monte Carlo molecular modeling of these structures is undesirably time consuming. A team led by Helena Zapolsky at the University of Rouen has developed a third supplemental approach. By treating atomic fragments as interacting pseudoparticles and considering the directionality, length and strength of interatomic bonds, the team successfully modeled the challenging selfassembly of diamond, zincblende, helix and double helix structures from a random atomic distribution. The team claims their approach will allow outstanding fundamental questions regarding self assembly of complex structures to be answered.",Mykola Lavrskyi; Helena Zapolsky; Armen G Khachaturyan,Condensedmatter physics; Materials science,"GPM, UMR 6634, University of Rouen, SaintEtienne du Rouvray, France; GPM, UMR 6634, University of Rouen, SaintEtienne du Rouvray, France; Department of Materials Science  Engineering, Rutgers University, Piscataway, USA; Department of Materials Science  Engineering, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, USA"

Here, a separation technique capable of sorting DWCNTs by semiconducting (S) or metallic (M) inner and outerwall electronic type is presented. Electronic coupling between the inner and outer wall is used to alter the surfactant coating around each of the DWCNT types, and aqueous gel permeation is used to separate them. Aqueous methods are used to remove SWCNT species from the raw material and prepare enriched DWCNT fractions. The enriched DWCNT fractions are then transferred into either chlorobenzene or toluene using the copolymer PFOBPy to yield the four innerouter combinations of MM, MS, SM and SS. The high purity of the resulting fractions is verified by absorption measurements, transmission electron microscopy, atomic force microscopy, resonance Raman mapping and highdensity fieldeffect transistor devices. For the first time, four different doublewalled carbon nanotubes were sorted via aqueous gel permeation according to the electronic coupling between the inner and outer wall.",Han Li; Georgy Gordeev; Soren Wasserroth; Venkata Sai Kiran Chakravadhanula; Shyam Kumar Chethala Neelakandhan; Frank Hennrich; Ado Jorio; Stephanie Reich; Ralph Krupke; Benjamin Scott Flavel,Carbon nanotubes and fullerenes; Electronic properties and materials,"Institute of Nanotechnology, Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, Karlsruhe, Germany; Department of Physics, Freie Universitat Berlin, Berlin, Germany; Department of Physics, Freie Universitat Berlin, Berlin, Germany; Institute of Nanotechnology, Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, Karlsruhe, Germany; Helmholtz Institute Ulm Electrochemical Energy Storage, Ulm, Germany; Institute of Nanotechnology, Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, Karlsruhe, Germany; Institute of Materials Science, Technische Universitat Darmstadt, Darmstadt, Germany; Institute of Nanotechnology, Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, Karlsruhe, Germany; Department of Physics, Federal University of Minas Gerais, Belo Horizonte, Brazil; Department of Physics, Freie Universitat Berlin, Berlin, Germany; Institute of Nanotechnology, Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, Karlsruhe, Germany; Institute of Materials Science, Technische Universitat Darmstadt, Darmstadt, Germany; Institute of Nanotechnology, Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, Karlsruhe, Germany; Institute of Materials Science, Technische Universitat Darmstadt, Darmstadt, Germany"

The trypsinlike serine protease, urokinasetype plasminogen activator (uPA), is central in tissue remodeling processes and also strongly implicated in tumor metastasis. We solved five Xray crystal structures of murine uPA (muPA) in the absence and presence of allosteric molecules andor substratelike molecules. The structure of unbound muPA revealed an unsuspected nonchymotrypsinlike protease conformation in which two strands in the core of the protease domain undergoes a major antiparalleltoparallel conformational transition. We next isolated two antimuPA nanobodies; an activesite binding nanobody and an allosteric nanobody. Crystal structures of the muPA:nanobody complexes and hydrogendeuterium exchange mass spectrometry revealed molecular insights about molecular factors controlling the antiparalleltoparallel equilibrium in muPA. Together with muPA activity assays, the data provide valuable insights into regulatory mechanisms and conformational flexibility of uPA and trypsinlike serine proteases in general.",Tobias KromannHansen; Eva Louise Lange; Hans Peter Srensen; Gholamreza HassanzadehGhassabeh; Mingdong Huang; Jan K.

Here we introduce induced domain swapping (INDOS) as a mechanism for regulating protein function. INDOS employs a modular design consisting of the fusion of two proteins: a recognition protein that binds a triggering molecule, and a target protein that undergoes a domain swap in response to binding of the triggering ligand. The recognition protein (FK506 binding protein) is inserted into functionallyinactivated point mutants of two target proteins (staphylococcal nuclease and ribose binding protein). Binding of FK506 to the FKBP domain causes the target domain to first unfold, then refold via domain swap. The inactivating mutations become 'swapped out' in the dimer, increasing nuclease and ribose binding activities by 100fold and 15fold, respectively, restoring them to near wildtype values. INDOS is intended to convert an arbitrary protein into a functional switch, and is the first example of rational design in which a small molecule is used to trigger protein domain swapping and subsequent activation of biological function.",Joshua M.

Several characteristics of this protozoan contribute to the lack of an effective vaccine, among them: its silent invasion mechanism, T. cruzi antigen redundancy and immunodominance without protection. Taking into account these issues, we engineered Traspain, a chimeric antigen tailored to present a multivalent display of domains from key parasitic molecules, combined with stimulation of the STING pathway by cdiAMP as a novel prophylactic strategy. This formulation proved to be effective for the priming of functional humoral responses and pathogenspecific CD8 and CD4 T cells, compatible with a Th1Th17 bias. Interestingly, vaccine effectiveness assessed across the course of infection, showed a reduction in parasite load and chronic inflammation in different proof of concept assays. In conclusion, this approach represents a promising tool against parasitic chronic infections. An amalgamation of parasitic proteins may be the first effective vaccine against the as yet untreatable chronic phase of Chagas disease. The infliction, caused by the parasite Trypanosoma cruzi (T. cruzi), is the world's leading cause of infectious cardiac inflammation and puts onesixth of the population of Latin America at risk of infection. International collaborators led by Emilio Malchiodi, of the University of Buenos Aires, Argentina, constructed a vaccine (dubbed 'Traspain') comprised of key T. cruzi proteins alongside a novel 'adjuvant'designed to promote the efficacy of a vaccine by activating inflammatory responses. The chimera and adjuvant combination elicited a promising immune response and also showed the capacity to prevent tissue damage caused by chronic infection.

Growing pigs (Duroc(LandraceLargeWhite)) were administered Ractopamine (a betaadrenergic agonist; BA; 20 ppm in feed) or Reporcin (recombinant growth hormone; GH; 10 mg48 hours injected) and compared to a control cohort (feed only; no injections) over a 27day time course (1, 3, 7, 13 or 27days). Longissimus Dorsi muscle gene expression was analyzed using Agilent porcine transcriptome microarrays and clusters of genes displaying similar expression profiles were identified using a modified maSigPro clustering algorithm. Anabolic agents increased carcass (p  0.002) and muscle weights (Vastus Lateralis: p  0.001; Semitendinosus: p  0.075). Skeletal muscle mRNA expression of serineonecarbonglycine biosynthesis pathway genes (Phgdh, Psat1 and Psph) and the gluconeogenic enzyme, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinaseM (Pck2PEPCKM), increased during treatment with BA, and to a lesser extent GH (p  0.001, treatment x time interaction). Treatment with BA, but not GH, caused a 2fold increase in phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase (PHGDH) protein expression at days 3 (p  0.05) and 7 (p  0.01), and a 2fold increase in PEPCKM protein expression at day 7 (p  0.01).

Presently, we sought to determine whether mitochondrial transplantation rescue mitochondrial function in a cybrid cell model of mitochondrial myopathy, encephalopathy, lactic acidosis, and strokelike episodes (MELAS) disease. Following PMD, recipient cells had internalized donor mitochondria after 1 h, and expressed higher levels of normal mitochondrial DNA, particularly at the end of the treatment and 11 days later. After 4 days, mitochondrial respiratory function had recovered and biogenesis was evident in the Pep1 and PMD groups, compared to the untreated MELAS group. However, only PMD was able to reverse the fusiontofission ratio of mitochondrial morphology, and mitochondria shaping proteins resembled the normal pattern seen in the control group. Cell survival following hydrogen peroxideinduced oxidative stress was also improved in the PMD group. Finally, we observed that PMD partially normalized cytokine expression, including that of interleukin (IL)7, granulocyte macrophagecolonystimulating factor (GMCSF), and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), in the MELAS cells.

bc1359cff1374f86b177af9c91cc1fa6,Deep characterization of a common D4Z4 variant identifies biallelic DUX4 expression as a modifier for disease penetrance in FSHD2,"Facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy is caused by incomplete repression of the transcription factor DUX4 in skeletal muscle as a consequence of D4Z4 macrosatellite repeat contraction in chromosome 4q35 (FSHD1) or variants in genes encoding D4Z4 chromatin repressors (FSHD2). A clinical hallmark of FSHD is variability in onset and progression suggesting the presence of disease modifiers. A wellknown cis modifier is the polymorphic DUX4 polyadenylation signal (PAS) that defines FSHD permissive alleles: D4Z4 chromatin relaxation on nonpermissive alleles which lack the DUX4PAS cannot cause disease in the absence of stable DUX4 mRNA. We have explored the nature and relevance of a common variant of the major FSHD haplotype 4A161, which is defined by 1.6 kb size difference of the most distal D4Z4 repeat unit. While the short variant (4A161S) has been extensively studied, we demonstrate that the long variant (4A161L) is relatively common in the European population, is capable of expressing DUX4, but that DUX4 mRNA processing differs from 4A161S. While we do not find evidence for a difference in disease severity between FSHD carriers of an 4A161S or 4A161L allele, our study does uncover biallelic DUX4 expression in FSHD2 patients. Compared to control individuals, we observed an increased frequency of FSHD2 patients homozygous for disease permissive alleles, and who are thus capable of biallelic DUX4 expression, while SMCHD1 variant carriers with only one permissive allele were significantly more often asymptomatic. This suggests that biallelic DUX4 expression lowers the threshold for disease presentation and is a modifier for disease severity in FSHD2.",Richard JLF Lemmers; Patrick J van der Vliet; Judit Balog; Jelle J Goeman; Wibowo Arindrarto; Yvonne D Krom; Kirsten R Straasheijm; Rashmie D Debipersad; Gizem Ozel; Janet Sowden; Lauren Snider; Karlien Mul; Sabrina Sacconi; Baziel van Engelen; Stephen J Tapscott; Rabi Tawil; Silvere M van der Maarel,Neuromuscular disease; Transcriptomics,"Department of Human Genetics, Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden, Netherlands; Department of Human Genetics, Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden, Netherlands; Department of Human Genetics, Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden, Netherlands; Medical Statistics and Bioinformatics, Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden, Netherlands; Department of Molecular Epidemiology, Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden, Netherlands; Department of Neurology, Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden, Netherlands; Department of Human Genetics, Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden, Netherlands; Department of Human Genetics, Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden, Netherlands; Department of Human Genetics, Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden, Netherlands; Neuromuscular Disease Unit, Department of Neurology, University of Rochester Medical Center, Rochester, USA; Division of Human Biology, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, USA; Neuromuscular Centre Nijmegen, Department of Neurology, Radboud University Nijmegen Medical Centre, Nijmegen, Netherlands; Centre de reference des Maladies neuromusculaires and CNRS UMR6543, Nice University Hospital, Nice, France; Neuromuscular Centre Nijmegen, Department of Neurology, Radboud University Nijmegen Medical Centre, Nijmegen, Netherlands; Division of Human Biology, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, USA; Neuromuscular Disease Unit, Department of Neurology, University of Rochester Medical Center, Rochester, USA; Department of Human Genetics, Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden, Netherlands"

Main outcome was nonfatal or fatal repeat suicide attempt within six months. Also, repeat attempt using a violent method was used as an additional outcome in separate analyses. Data were analyzed for the total group and for men and women separately. Repeat attempts were observed within six months in 78 persons (22%) and 21 (6%) of these used a violent method. KIVS total score of 6 or more was associated with repeat suicide attempt within six months (OR  1.81, CI 1.083.02) and predicted new attempts with a sensitivity of 62% and a specificity of 53%. A threefold increase in odds ratio was observed for repeat attempt using a violent method (OR  3.40, CI 1.229.49). An association between exposure to violence in adulthood and violent reattempt was seen in women (OR  1.38, CI 1.061.82).

However, only few studies have examined the molecular basis of thermosensing; an ability that microorganisms must possess in order to respond to environmental temperature and regulate cellular processes. Two component regulatory systems have been inferred to function in thermal regulation of gene expression, but biochemical studies assessing these systems in Bacteria are rare, and none have been performed in Archaea or psychrophiles. Here we examined the LtrKLtrR two component regulatory system from the Antarctic archaeon, Methanococcoides burtonii, assessing kinase and phosphatase activities of wildtype and mutant proteins. LtrK was thermally unstable and had optimal phosphorylation activity at 10 C (the lowest optimum activity for any psychrophilic enzyme), high activity at 0 C and was rapidly thermally inactivated at 30 C. These biochemical properties match well with normal environmental temperatures of M. burtonii (04 C) and the temperature this psychrophile is capable of growing at in the laboratory (2 to 28 C).

In this paper, the use of Escherichia coli MC1000 minD minicells as a nonreproducing chassis for SimCells was explored, as demonstrated by their ability to act as sensitive biosensors for small molecules. Highly purified minicells derived from E. coli strains containing gene circuits for biosensing were able to transduce the input signals from several small molecules (glucarate, acrylate and arabinose) into the production of green fluorescent protein (GFP). A mathematical model was developed to fit the experimental data for induction of gene expression in SimCells. The intracellular ATP level was shown to be important for SimCell function.

a7108a7768584892bdf44f20c019f716,On the shedding of impaled droplets: The role of transient intervening layers,"Maintaining the nonwetting property of textured hydrophobic surfaces is directly related to the preservation of an intervening fluid layer (gaseous or immiscible liquid) between the droplet and substrate; once displaced, it cannot be recovered spontaneously as the fully penetrated Wenzel wetting state is energetically favorable. Here, we identify pathways for the ""lifting"" of droplets from the surface texture, enabling a complete WenzeltoCassieBaxter wetting state transition. This is accomplished by the hemiwicking of a transient (limited lifetime due to evaporation) low surface tension (LST) liquid, which is capable of selfassembling as an intervening underlayer, lifting the droplet from its impaled state and facilitating a skatinglike behavior. In the skating phase, a critical substrate tilting angle is identified, up to which underlayer and droplet remain coupled exhibiting a pseudoCassieBaxter state. For greater titling angles, the droplet, driven by inertia, detaches itself from the liquid intervening layer and transitions to a traditional CassieBaxter wetting state, thereby accelerating and leaving the underlayer behind. A model is also presented that elucidates the mechanism of mobility recovery. Ultimately, this work provides a better understanding of multiphase mass transfer of immiscible LST liquidwater mixtures with respect to establishing facile methods towards retaining intervening layers.",Christos Stamatopoulos; Thomas M.

Currently, there are no targeted therapeutic agents for the treatment of this disease, and effective treatment options remain very limited. Here we describe the results of a programme that aimed to rapidly discover lead compounds for clinical use, by combining structureassisted drug design, virtual drug screening and highthroughput screening. This programme focused on identifying drug leads that target main protease (Mpro) of SARSCoV2: Mpro is a key enzyme of coronaviruses and has a pivotal role in mediating viral replication and transcription, making it an attractive drug target for SARSCoV25,6. We identified a mechanismbased inhibitor (N3) by computeraided drug design, and then determined the crystal structure of Mpro of SARSCoV2 in complex with this compound. Through a combination of structurebased virtual and highthroughput screening, we assayed over 10,000 compoundsincluding approved drugs, drug candidates in clinical trials and other pharmacologically active compoundsas inhibitors of Mpro. Six of these compounds inhibited Mpro, showing halfmaximal inhibitory concentration values that ranged from 0.67 to 21.4 M. One of these compounds (ebselen) also exhibited promising antiviral activity in cellbased assays. Our results demonstrate the efficacy of our screening strategy, which can lead to the rapid discovery of drug leads with clinical potential in response to new infectious diseases for which no specific drugs or vaccines are available. A programme of structureassisted drug design and highthroughput screening identifies six compounds that inhibit the main protease of SARSCoV2, demonstrating the ability of this strategy to isolate drug leads with clinical potential.",Zhenming Jin; Xiaoyu Du; Yechun Xu; Yongqiang Deng; Meiqin Liu; Yao Zhao; Bing Zhang; Xiaofeng Li; Leike Zhang; Chao Peng; Yinkai Duan; Jing Yu; Lin Wang; Kailin Yang; Fengjiang Liu; Rendi Jiang; Xinglou Yang; Tian You; Xiaoce Liu; Xiuna Yang; Fang Bai; Hong Liu; Xiang Liu; Luke W.

591fb27ca4934f1f9c89f04d9372f3bc,A FRET biosensor for necroptosis uncovers two different modes of the release of DAMPs,"Necroptosis is a regulated form of necrosis that depends on receptorinteracting protein kinase (RIPK)3 and mixed lineage kinase domainlike (MLKL). While dangerassociated molecular pattern (DAMP)s are involved in various pathological conditions and released from dead cells, the underlying mechanisms are not fully understood. Here we develop a fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) biosensor, termed SMART (a sensor for MLKL activation by RIPK3 based on FRET). SMART is composed of a fragment of MLKL and monitors necroptosis, but not apoptosis or necrosis. Mechanistically, SMART monitors plasma membrane translocation of oligomerized MLKL, which is induced by RIPK3 or mutational activation. SMART in combination with imaging of the release of nuclear DAMPs and LiveCell Imaging for Secretion activity (LCIS) reveals two different modes of the release of High Mobility Group Box 1 from necroptotic cells. Thus, SMART and LCIS uncover novel regulation of the release of DAMPs during necroptosis. Necroptotic cells activate MLKL and release inflammatory DAMPs, although the underlying regulatory mechanisms of this process are poorly understood. Here, Murai et al. develop a necroptosisspecific FRET sensor (SMART) that monitors MLKL membrane translocation to identify two modes of DAMP release.",Shin Murai; Yoshifumi Yamaguchi; Yoshitaka Shirasaki; Mai Yamagishi; Ryodai Shindo; Joanne M.

However, access to the brain requires invasive procedures, such as the removal of a portion of the skull or the drilling of a burr hole. Also, electrode implantation into tissue can cause inflammatory tissue responses and brain trauma, and lead to device failure. Here, we report the development and application of a chronically implanted platinum electrode array mounted on a nitinol endovascular stent for the localized stimulation of cortical tissue from within a blood vessel. Following percutaneous angiographic implantation of the device in sheep, we observed stimulationinduced responses of the facial muscles and limbs of the animals, similar to those evoked by electrodes implanted via invasive surgery. Proximity of the electrode to the motor cortex, yet not its orientation, was integral to achieving reliable responses from discrete neuronal populations. The minimally invasive endovascular surgical approach offered by the stentmounted electrode array might enable safe and efficacious stimulation of focal regions in the brain. Focal stimulation of cortical tissue from within a blood vessel via an electrode array mounted on a minimally invasive endovascular stent elicits responses from specific facial muscles and limbs in sheep.",Nicholas L.

Although reported two decades ago, the assembly of GPCRs into dimer and larger oligomers in their native environment is still a matter of intense debate. Here, using number and brightness analysis of fluorescently labeled receptors in cultured hippocampal neurons, we confirm that the metabotropic glutamate receptor type 2 (mGlu2) is a homodimer at expression levels in the physiological range, while heterodimeric GABAB receptors form larger complexes. Surprisingly, we observed the formation of larger mGlu2 oligomers upon both activation and inhibition of the receptor. Stabilizing the receptor in its inactive conformation using biochemical constraints also led to the observation of oligomers. Following our recent observation that mGlu receptors are in constant and rapid equilibrium between several states under basal conditions, we propose that this structural heterogeneity limits receptor oligomerization. Such assemblies are expected to stabilize either the active or the inactive state of the receptor.",Thor C. Mller; Jerome Hottin; Caroline Clerte; Jurriaan M.

A key question is: how do collagens allow tissue flexibility whilst maintaining welldefined ligand binding sites? Here we show that proline residues in collagen glycineprolinehydroxyproline (GlyProHyp) triplets provide local conformational flexibility, which in turn confers welldefined, low energy molecular compressionextension and bending, by employing twodimensional 13C13C correlation NMR spectroscopy on 13Clabelled intact ex vivo bone and in vitro osteoblast extracellular matrix. We also find that the positions of GlyProHyp triplets are highly conserved between animal species, and are spatially clustered in the currentlyaccepted model of molecular ordering in collagen type I fibrils. We propose that the GlyProHyp triplets in fibrillar collagens provide fibril ""expansion joints"" to maintain molecular ordering within the fibril, thereby preserving the structural integrity of ligand binding sites.",Wing Ying Chow; Chris J.

Indeed, these implementations are among the few alternatives for quantum technologies that may operate even at room temperature, and therefore discoveries and characterization of novel point defects may highly facilitate future solid state quantum technologies. First principles calculations play an important role in point defect research, since they provide a direct, extended insight into the formation of the defect states. In the last decades, considerable efforts have been made to calculate spindependent properties of point defects from first principles. The developed methods have already demonstrated their essential role in quantitative understanding of the physics and application of point defect qubits. Here, we review and discuss accuracy aspects of these novel ab initio methods and report on their most relevant applications for existing point defect qubits in semiconductors. We pay attention to the advantages and limitations of the methodological solutions and highlight additional developments that are expected in the near future.

The supersolid phase of matter was predicted 50 years ago13 for solid helium48. Ultracold quantum gases have recently been made to exhibit periodic order typical of a crystal, owing to various types of controllable interaction913. A crucial feature of a Ddimensional supersolid is the occurrence of D  1 gapless excitations, reflecting the Goldstone modes associated with the spontaneous breaking of two continuous symmetries: the breaking of phase invariance, corresponding to the locking of the phase of the atomic wave functions at the origin of superfluid phenomena, and the breaking of translational invariance due to the lattice structure of the system. Such modes have been the object of intense theoretical investigations1,1418, but they have not yet been observed experimentally. Here we demonstrate supersolid symmetry breaking through the appearance of two distinct compressional oscillation modes in a harmonically trapped dipolar BoseEinstein condensate, reflecting the gapless Goldstone excitations of the homogeneous system. We observe that the higherfrequency mode is associated with an oscillation of the periodicity of the emergent lattice and the lowerfrequency mode characterizes the superfluid oscillations. This work also suggests the presence of two separate quantum phase transitions between the superfluid, supersolid and solidlike configurations. Two distinct compressional oscillation modes are characterized in a dipolar BoseEinstein condensate; this demonstrates the breaking of two symmetries owing to the coexisting superfluid and crystal properties of a supersolid.",L.

The generation and propagation of surface plasmon polaritons on the surface of an ultrathin topological insulator Sb2Te3 film with a thickness of 100 nm is confirmed, exhibiting plasmonic figures of merit superior to noble metal plasmonics in the ultravioletvisible frequency range. Angularmomentum nanometrology with a low crosstalk of less than 20 dB is achieved. This compact highprecision angularmomentum nanometrology opens an unprecedented opportunity for onchip manipulation of optical angular momentum for highcapacity information processing, ultrasensitive molecular sensing, and ultracompact multifunctional optoelectronic devices.

Femtosecond Xray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) arises as an essential experimental probing method, as it can simultaneously reveal both electronic and atomic structures, and thus potentially unravel their nonequilibrium dynamic interplay which is at the origin of most of the ultrafast mechanisms. However, despite considerable efforts, there is still no femtosecond Xray source suitable for routine experiments. Here we show that betatron radiation from relativistic laserplasma interaction combines ideal features for femtosecond XAS. It has been used to investigate the nonequilibrium dynamics of a copper sample brought at extreme conditions of temperature and pressure by a femtosecond laser pulse. We measured a risetime of the electron temperature below 100 fs. This experiment demonstrates the great potential of the tabletop betatron source which makes possible the investigation of unexplored ultrafast processes in manifold fields of research.

Current methods for its extraction from lignocellulosic biomasswhich include the kraft, sulfite, and organosolv processesresult in the rapid formation of carboncarbon bonds, leading to a condensed lignin that cannot be effectively depolymerized into its constituent monomers. Treatment of lignocellulosic biomass with aldehydes during lignin extraction generates an aldehydestabilized lignin that is uncondensed and can be converted into its monomers at neartheoretical yields. Here, we outline an efficient, reproducible, and scalable process for extracting and purifying this aldehydestabilized lignin as a solid, which can easily be redissolved in an organic solvent. Upon exposure to hydrogenolysis conditions, this material provides neartheoretical yields of aromatic monomers (~4050% of the Klason lignin for a typical hardwood). Cellulose and hemicellulose are also efficiently fractionated. This protocol requires 67 h for the extraction of the stabilized lignin and a basic proficiency in synthetic chemistry.

825ae04539cd48a0ad8243255d8cc1a1,The role of autophagy in colitisassociated colorectal cancer,"Autophagy is an evolutionarily conserved catabolic process that eliminates harmful components through lysosomal degradation. In addition to its role in maintaining cellular homeostasis, autophagy is critical to pathological processes, such as inflammation and cancer. Colitisassociated colorectal cancer (CAC) is a specific type of colorectal cancer that develops from longstanding colitis in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients. Accumulating evidence indicates that autophagy of microenvironmental cells plays different but vital roles during tumorigenesis and CAC development. Herein, after summarizing the recent advances in understanding the role of autophagy in regulating the tumor microenvironment during different CAC stages, we draw the following conclusions: autophagy in intestinal epithelial cells inhibits colitis and CAC initiation but promotes CAC progression; autophagy in macrophages inhibits colitis, but its function on CAC is currently unclear; autophagy in neutrophils and cancerassociated fibroblasts (CAFs) promotes both colitis and CAC; autophagy in dendritic cells (DCs) and T cells represses both colitis and CAC; autophagy in natural killer cells (NKs) inhibits colitis, but promotes CAC; and autophagy in endothelial cells plays a controversial role in colitis and CAC. Understanding the role of autophagy in specific compartments of the tumor microenvironment during different stages of CAC may provide insight into malignant transformation, tumor progression, and combination therapy strategies for CAC. A cellular recycling process called autophagy plays a prominent but complicated role in the natural history of inflammationinduced colorectal cancer. Autophagy helps cells to break down unnecessary or unwanted components, but can also eliminate harmful biomolecules and even pathogens. Researchers led by Hongming Pan and Weidong Han of Zhejiang University in China have reviewed the involvement of this process in colorectal tumorigenesis in the aftermath of inflammatory conditions like ulcerative colitis, and highlight the challenges of targeting autophagy therapeutically. For example, autophagy in epithelial cells can protect against cancer onset by eliminating inflammationpromoting compounds and signals. However, once an epithelial tumor forms, autophagy can have the unwanted effect of helping tumors thrive and overcome therapy. As such, autophagymodulating agents must be carefully selected in terms of when and how they are employed for cancer treatment.",Yuhui Wu; Junlin Yao; Jiansheng Xie; Zhen Liu; Yubin Zhou; Hongming Pan; Weidong Han,Gastrointestinal cancer,"Department of Medical Oncology, Sir Run Run Shaw Hospital, College of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, China; Department of Medical Oncology, Sir Run Run Shaw Hospital, College of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, China; Laboratory of Cancer Biology, Institute of Clinical Science, Sir Run Run Shaw Hospital, College of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, China; Department of Medical Oncology, Sir Run Run Shaw Hospital, College of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, China; Center for Translational Cancer Research, Institute of Biosciences and Technology, Texas AM University Health Science Center, Houston, USA; Department of Medical Oncology, Sir Run Run Shaw Hospital, College of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, China; Department of Medical Oncology, Sir Run Run Shaw Hospital, College of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, China"

Although hydroxymethylene has been suggested as a building block for sugar formation, it is a reactive species that had escaped detection until recently. Here we demonstrate that formaldehyde reacts with its isomer hydroxymethylene to give glycolaldehyde in a nearly barrierless reaction. This carbonylenetype transformation operates in the absence of base and solvent at cryogenic temperatures similar to those found in extraterrestrial environments or interstellar clouds. Hydroxymethylene acts as a building block for an iterative sugar synthesis, as we demonstrate through the formation of the triose glyceraldehyde. The thermodynamically preferred ketose dihydroxyacetone does not form, and the formation of further branched sugars in the iterative synthesis presented here is unlikely. The results therefore provide a link between the wellknown formose (Butlerow) reaction and sugar formation under nonaqueous conditions. The simplest sugarglycolaldehydehas recently been detected in space and now a mechanistic rationale for its formation is presented, which includes its onward reaction to the next higher aldose, glyceraldehyde. The key species in the chemistry at play is the formaldehyde isomer hydroxymethylene, which reacts with the carbonyl component in an essentially barrierless carbonylenetype reaction.

There is, however, a relatively limited understanding of the broader environmental factors, particularly social conditions, that shape variation in human microbial communities. Fulfilling the promise of microbiome research  particularly the microbiome's potential for modification  will require collaboration between biologists and social and population scientists. For life scientists, the plasticity and adaptiveness of the microbiome calls for an agenda to understand the sensitivity of the microbiome to broader social environments already known to be powerful predictors of morbidity and mortality. For social and population scientists, attention to the microbiome may help answer nagging questions about the underlying biological mechanisms that link social conditions to health. We outline key substantive and methodological advances that can be made if collaborations between social and population health scientists and life scientists are strategically pursued.

However, for metallic glasses, a welldefined structure feature which dominates the mechanical properties of the disordered materials is still missing. Here, we report that nanoscale spatial heterogeneity is the inherent structural feature of metallic glasses. It has an intrinsic correlation with the strength and deformation behavior. The strength and Young's modulus of metallic glasses can be defined by the function of the square root reciprocal of the characteristic length of the spatial heterogeneity. Moreover, the stretching exponent of timedependent strain relaxation can be quantitatively described by the characteristic length. Our study provides compelling evidence that the spatial heterogeneity is a feasible structural indicator for portraying mechanical properties of metallic glasses. Directly relating the mechanical properties of metallic glasses to their atomic structure remains a challenge. Here, the authors use high resolution microscopy to show many mechanical properties of metallic glasses depend on a single structural parameter, the characteristic length of spatial heterogeneity.",Fan Zhu; Shuangxi Song; Kolan Madhav Reddy; Akihiko Hirata; Mingwei Chen,Glasses; Mechanical properties; Metals and alloys; Structure of solids and liquids,"State Key Laboratory of Metal Matrix Composites, School of Materials Science and Engineering, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China; State Key Laboratory of Metal Matrix Composites, School of Materials Science and Engineering, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China; State Key Laboratory of Metal Matrix Composites, School of Materials Science and Engineering, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China; WPI Advanced Institute for Materials Research, Tohoku University, Sendai, Japan; WPI Advanced Institute for Materials Research, Tohoku University, Sendai, Japan; Department of Materials Science and Engineering, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, USA"

However, it is still a great challenge to stably produce such electron beams with lasers, since the typical subfemtosecond electron bunches from laserplasma interactions either carry low beam charge, or propagate for only several tens of femtoseconds. Here we propose an alloptical scheme for generating dense attosecond electron bunches via the interaction of an intense LaguerreGaussian (LG) laser pulse with a nanofiber. The dense bunch train results from the unique field structure of a circularly polarized LG laser pulse, enabling each bunch to be phaselocked and accelerated forward with low divergence, high beam charge and large beamangularmomentum. This paves the way for wide applications in various fields, e.g., ultrabrilliant attosecond xray emission.",LiXiang Hu; TongPu Yu; ZhengMing Sheng; Jorge Vieira; DeBin Zou; Yan Yin; Paul McKenna; FuQiu Shao,Laserproduced plasmas; Nonlinear optics; Plasmabased accelerators,"Department of Physics, National University of Defense Technology, Changsha, China; Department of Physics, National University of Defense Technology, Changsha, China; SUPA Department of Physics, University of Strathclyde, Glasgow, UK; SUPA Department of Physics, University of Strathclyde, Glasgow, UK; Collaborative Innovation Center of IFSA (CICIFSA), Key Laboratory for Laser Plasmas (MoE) and School of Physics and Astronomy, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China; TsungDao Lee Institute, Shanghai, China; GoLPInstituto de Plasmas e Fusao Nuclear, Instituto Superior Tecnico, Universidade de Lisboa, Lisbon, Portugal; Department of Physics, National University of Defense Technology, Changsha, China; Department of Physics, National University of Defense Technology, Changsha, China; Institute of Applied Physics and Computational Mathematics, Beijing, China; SUPA Department of Physics, University of Strathclyde, Glasgow, UK; Department of Physics, National University of Defense Technology, Changsha, China"

The new laccase showed outstanding stability to temperature, pH (29) and to organic solvents, while maintaining the ability to oxidize highredox potential substrates. By engineering the signal peptide, enzyme secretion levels in Saccharomyces cerevisiae were increased, which allowed to purify the engineered enzyme for further characterization. The purified domainswap laccase presented higher activity in the presence of ethanol or methanol, superior halflives at 5070 C, improved stability at acidic pH, and similar catalytic efficiency for DMP albeit a lower one for ABTS (due to a shift in optimum pH). A new Nglycosylation site and a putative new surface saltbridge were evaluated as possible determinants for the improved stability by sitedirected mutagenesis. Although neither seemed to be strictly responsible for the improved thermostability, the new salt bridge was found to notably contribute to the high stability of the swapped enzyme in a broad pH range. Finally, the application potential of the new laccase was demonstrated with the enzymatic treatment of kraft lignin, an industrially relevant lignin stream, at high temperature, neutral pH and short incubation times.",Isabel Pardo; David RodriguezEscribano; Pablo Aza; Felipe de Salas; Angel T.

Here we use the exceptional ground displacement and geochemical datasets from the actively degassing Campi Flegrei caldera (Southern Italy) to show that ambiguities disappear when the thermal evolution of the deep hydrothermal system is accurately tracked. By using temperatures from the CO2CH4 exchange of 13C and thermodynamic analysis of gas ascending in the crust, we demonstrate that after the last 198284 crisis the deep hydrothermal system evolved through supercritical conditions under the continuous isenthalpic inflow of hot CO2rich gases released from the deep (~8 km) magma reservoir of regional size. This resulted in the drying of the base of the hot hydrothermal system, no more buffered along the liquidvapour equilibrium, and excludes any shallow arrival of new magma, whose abundant steam degassing due to decompression would have restored liquidvapour equilibrium. The consequent CO2infiltration and progressive heating of the surrounding deforming rock volume cause the buildup of pore pressure in aquifers, and generate the striking temporal symmetry that characterizes the ongoing uplift and the post1984 subsidence, both originated by the same but reversed deformation mechanism.",R.

EETs exert vasodilatory, antiinflammatory, antiapoptotic, and proangiogenic effects. Administration of sEH inhibitors before or at the onset of stroke is protective, but the effects of posttreatment at reperfusion, when inflammation is augmented, has not been as well studied. We tested the hypothesis that 1Trifluoromethoxyphenyl3(1propionylpiperidin4yl)urea (TPPU), a potent and highly selective sEH inhibitor, suppresses inflammation and protects the brain when administered at reperfusion. Vehicle or 1 mgkg TPPU was administered at reperfusion after 90 minutes of focal ischemia and again 24 hours later. Protein expression and activity of sEH increased after reperfusion and activity was decreased by TPPU administration. TPPU decreased infarct volume by 50%, reduced neurologic deficits and improved performance on sensorimotor tasks. Furthermore, TPPU significantly lowered the mRNA expression of interleukin1beta by 3.5fold and tumor necrosis factoralpha by 2.2fold, increased transforming growth factorbeta mRNA by 1.8fold, and augmented immunostaining of vascular endothelial growth factor in periinfarct cortex. Thus, inhibition of sEH at reperfusion significantly reduces infarction and improves sensorimotor function, possibly by suppressing early proinflammatory cytokines and promoting reparative cytokines and growth factors.",Ranran Tu; Jillian Armstrong; Kin Sing Stephen Lee; Bruce D.

bddaad9ea4114e5b91c778098f06dc20,Epigenetic regulation in AKI and kidney repair: mechanisms and therapeutic implications,"Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a major public health concern associated with high morbidity and mortality. Despite decades of research, the pathogenesis of AKI remains incompletely understood and effective therapies are lacking. An increasing body of evidence suggests a role for epigenetic regulation in the process of AKI and kidney repair, involving remarkable changes in histone modifications, DNA methylation and the expression of various noncoding RNAs. For instance, increases in levels of histone acetylation seem to protect kidneys from AKI and promote kidney repair. AKI is also associated with changes in genomewide and genespecific DNA methylation; however, the role and regulation of DNA methylation in kidney injury and repair remains largely elusive. MicroRNAs have been studied quite extensively in AKI, and a plethora of specific microRNAs have been implicated in the pathogenesis of AKI. Emerging research suggests potential for microRNAs as novel diagnostic biomarkers of AKI. Further investigation into these epigenetic mechanisms will not only generate novel insights into the mechanisms of AKI and kidney repair but also might lead to new strategies for the diagnosis and therapy of this disease. A growing body of evidence suggests that epigenetic regulation is involved in the process of acute kidney injury (AKI) and kidney repair. This Review provides a general overview of the main epigenetic mechanisms that have been linked to AKI and discusses the challenges and therapeutic implications of these findings.

To gain further insights regarding PFASs exposure in humans, we here aimed to characterize the associations between different PFASs and the metabolome. In this crosssectional study, we investigated 965 individuals from Sweden (all aged 70 years, 50% women) sampled in 20012004. PFASs were analyzed in plasma using isotopedilution ultrapressure liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (UPLCMSMS). Nontarget metabolomics profiling was performed in plasma using UPLC coupled to timeofflight mass spectrometry (UPLCQTOFMS) operated in positive electrospray mode. Multivariate linear regression analysis was used to investigate associations between circulating levels of PFASs and metabolites. In total, 15 metabolites, predominantly from lipid pathways, were associated with levels of PFASs following adjustment for sex, smoking, exercise habits, education, energy, and alcohol intake, after correction for multiple testing. Perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA) and perfluoroundecanoic acid (PFUnDA) were strongly associated with multiple glycerophosphocholines and fatty acids including docosapentaenoic acid (DPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA).

The fibrotic microenvironment is characterised by an increased stiffness, with rigidity associated with disease progression. External stiffness is known to promote hepatic stellate cell (HSC) activation through mechanotransduction, leading to increased secretion of ECM components. HSCs are key effector cells which maintain the composition of the ECM in health and disease, not only by regulating secretion of ECM proteins such as collagen, but also ECMdegrading enzymes called matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and their inhibitors (TIMPs). Uninhibited MMPs degrade ECM proteins to reduce external rigidity. Using fibronectincoated polyacrylamide gels to alter substrate rigidity without altering ligand density, we show that fibrotic rigidities downregulate MMP9 expression and secretion, and also upregulate secretion of TIMP1, though not its expression. Using tissue immunofluorescence studies, we also report that the expression of MMP9 is significantly decreased in activated HSCs in fibrotic tissues associated with hepatocellular carcinoma. This suggests the presence of a mechanical network that allows HSCs to maintain a fibrotic ECM, with external rigidity providing feedback which affects MMP9 and TIMP1 secretion, which may become dysregulated in fibrosis.",Dariusz Lachowski; Ernesto Cortes; Alistair Rice; David Pinato; Krista Rombouts; Armando del Rio Hernandez,Cancer models; Cell biology,"Cellular and Molecular Biomechanics Laboratory, Department of Bioengineering, Faculty of Engineering, Imperial College London, London, UK; Cellular and Molecular Biomechanics Laboratory, Department of Bioengineering, Faculty of Engineering, Imperial College London, London, UK; Cellular and Molecular Biomechanics Laboratory, Department of Bioengineering, Faculty of Engineering, Imperial College London, London, UK; Hammersmith Hospital, Imperial College London, London, UK; Regenerative Medicine and Fibrosis Group, Institute for Liver and Digestive Health, University College London, Royal Free Hospital, London, UK; Cellular and Molecular Biomechanics Laboratory, Department of Bioengineering, Faculty of Engineering, Imperial College London, London, UK"
2c7d4f0fc86d4e89a218f7910d9600cc,FGL2 promotes tumor progression in the CNS by suppressing CD103  dendritic cell differentiation,"Few studies implicate immunoregulatory gene expression in tumor cells in arbitrating brain tumor progression. Here we show that fibrinogenlike protein 2 (FGL2) is highly expressed in glioma stem cells and primary glioblastoma (GBM) cells. FGL2 knockout in tumor cells did not affect tumorcell proliferation in vitro or tumor progression in immunodeficient mice but completely impaired GBM progression in immunecompetent mice. This impairment was reversed in mice with a defect in dendritic cells (DCs) or CD103 DC differentiation in the brain and in tumordraining lymph nodes. The presence of FGL2 in tumor cells inhibited granulocytemacrophage colonystimulating factor (GMCSF)induced CD103 DC differentiation by suppressing NFB, STAT15, and p38 activation. These findings are relevant to GBM patients because a low level of FGL2 expression with concurrent high GMCSF expression is associated with higher CD8B expression and longer survival. These data provide a rationale for therapeutic inhibition of FGL2 in brain tumors. Fibrinogenlike protein 2 (FGL2) mediates immune suppression in glioblastoma (GBM). Here, the authors show that FGL2 expressed by GBM cancer cells acts by suppressing the differentiation of CD103 DC cells required to activate the antitumor CD8 T cell response via blocking GMCSF signalling at NFKB, STAT15 and p38 level.",Jun Yan; Qingnan Zhao; Konrad Gabrusiewicz; LingYuan Kong; Xueqing Xia; Jian Wang; Martina Ott; Jingda Xu; R.

We assemble genomewide association studies of estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), a measure of kidney function that defines CKD, in 312,468 individuals of diverse ancestry. We identify 127 distinct association signals with homogeneous effects on eGFR across ancestries and enrichment in genomic annotations including kidneyspecific histone modifications. Finemapping reveals 40 highconfidence variants driving eGFR associations and highlights putative causal genes with celltype specific expression in glomerulus, and in proximal and distal nephron. Mendelian randomisation supports causal effects of eGFR on overall and causespecific CKD, kidney stone formation, diastolic blood pressure and hypertension. These results define novel molecular mechanisms and putative causal genes for eGFR, offering insight into clinical outcomes and routes to CKD treatment development.

Decreased AC026166.2001 was associated with poorer prognosis and may act as a novel biomarker for LSCC patients. In this study, AC026166.2001 was overexpressed by a lentivirus vector and downregulated by a small interfering RNA (siRNA). The results of realtime cell analysis (RTCA) and a plate colony formation assay showed that AC026166.2001 inhibited LSCC cell proliferation and the cloneforming capacity. Cell cycle distribution and related protein changes were measured by flow cytometry. AC026166.2001 arrested the cell cycle at the G1 phase and induced apoptosis. In addition, AC026166.2001 decreased cell migration as measured by wound healing assays and transwell migration assays. Moreover, luciferase reporter assay and Western blotting results suggested that AC026166.2001 acts as a sponge of miR243p and regulates the expression of p27 and cyclin D1. The in vivo results showed that AC026166.2001 significantly suppressed the growth of LSCC xenografts and promoted apoptosis. We validated the molecular mechanisms underlying AC026166.2001 in LSCC.

This study aimed to identify genetic factors and pathogenesis of gout from hyperuricemia by genomewide association study (GWAS). 747 gout patients, 747 hyperuricemia and 2071 agematched controls were recruited and analyzed with Affymetrix 650 K chip to find the related genetic variants. The functions of the related genes were investigated in an endothelial cell (EC) with urate crystal stimulation. The GWAS results showed 36 SNPs to be strongly associated with gout compared to controls (all pvalues  107). Whereas the rs2231142 in ABCG2 gene had significant associations between gout and controls, between gout and hyperuricemia, and between hyperuricemia and controls (all pvalues  107), and the ORs were 4.34, 3.37 and 2.15 (all pvalues  0.001) after adjustment of potential confounders, respectively. The cell model showed significantly higher IL8 release from EC combined with ABCG2 knockdown. We concluded that ABCG2 gene contributed to hyperuricemia but also gout, and that it was involved in the inflammation dysregulation via augmented IL8 release in EC.",ChungJen Chen; ChiaChun Tseng; JengHsien Yen; JanGowth Chang; WenCheng Chou; HouWei Chu; ShunJen Chang; WeiTing Liao,Gout; Molecular medicine,"Division of General Internal Medicine, Department of Internal Medicine, Kaohsiung Medical University Hospital, Kaohsiung, Taiwan; Department of Internal Medicine, College of Medicine, Kaohsiung Medical University, Kaohsiung, Taiwan; Department of Internal Medicine, Kaohsiung Municipal TaTung Hospital, Kaohsiung, Kaohsiung Medical University, Kaohsiung, Taiwan; Division of Rheumatology, Department of Internal Medicine, Kaohsiung Medical University Hospital, Kaohsiung, Taiwan; Graduate Institute of Medicine, College of Medicine, Kaohsiung Medical University, Kaohsiung, Taiwan; Department of Laboratory Medicine and Epigenome Research Center, China Medical University Hospital, China Medical University, Kaohsiung, Taiwan; Institute of Biomedical Sciences, Academia Sinica, Taipei, Taiwan; Institute of Biomedical Sciences, Academia Sinica, Taipei, Taiwan; Department of Kinesiology, Health and Leisure Studies, National University of Kaohsiung, Kaohsiung, Taiwan; Department of Medical Research, Kaohsiung Medical University Hospital, Kaohsiung, Taiwan; Department of Biotechnology, College of Life Science, Kaohsiung Medical University, Kaohsiung, Taiwan"

To investigate potential crosstalk between RAAS and FGF23, we administered angiotensin II (Ang II) to wildtype rodents and the Hyp mouse model of excess FGF23. Ang II administration for four weeks to wildtype rodents resulted in significant increases in systolic blood pressure and LVH. Unexpectedly, FGF23 circulating levels were increased by 1.51.7 fold in Ang II treated animals. In addition, Ang II treatment increased expression of FGF23 message levels in bone, the predominant tissue for FGF23 production, and induced expression of FGF23 and its coreceptor Klotho in the heart, which normally does not express FGF23 or Klotho in physiologically relevant levels. Hyp mice with elevated FGF23 exhibited increased blood pressure and LVH at baseline. Ang II administration to Hyp mice resulted further increments in blood pressure and left ventricular hypertrophy, consistent with additive cardiovascular effects. These findings suggest that FGF23 may participate in unexpected systemic and paracrine networks regulating hemodynamic and myocardial responses.",Min Pi; Ruisong Ye; Xiaobin Han; Benjamin Armstrong; Xue Liu; Yuanjian Chen; Yao Sun; L.

With the increase in extreme weather events due to climate change and the constant pressure of diseases and pests, there is an urgent need to develop crop varieties that can tolerate multiple stresses. However, our knowledge of how plants broadly respond to stress is limited. Here, we explore the rice core stress response via metaanalysis of publicly available rice transcriptome data. Our results confirm that rice universally downregulates photosynthesis in response to both abiotic and biotic stress. Rice also generally upregulates hormoneresponsive genes during stress response, most notably genes in the abscisic acid, jasmonic acid and salicylic acid pathways. We identified several promoter motifs that are likely involved in stressresponsive regulatory mechanisms in rice. With this work, we provide a list of candidate genes to study for improving rice stress tolerance in light of environmental stresses. This work also serves as a proof of concept to show that metaanalysis of diverse transcriptome data is a valid approach to develop robust hypotheses for how plants respond to stress.",Stephen P.

Recently anecdotal evidence of possible therapeutic effects of cannabis products has emerged. The aim of this study is to characterize the epidemiology of ASD patients receiving medical cannabis treatment and to describe its safety and efficacy. We analysed the data prospectively collected as part of the treatment program of 188 ASD patients treated with medical cannabis between 2015 and 2017. The treatment in majority of the patients was based on cannabis oil containing 30% CBD and 1.5% THC. Symptoms inventory, patient global assessment and side effects at 6 months were primary outcomes of interest and were assessed by structured questionnaires. After six months of treatment 82.4% of patients (155) were in active treatment and 60.0% (93) have been assessed; 28 patients (30.1%) reported a significant improvement, 50 (53.7%) moderate, 6 (6.4%) slight and 8 (8.6%) had no change in their condition. Twentythree patients (25.2%) experienced at least one side effect; the most common was restlessness (6.6%).

We observed the acceleration and oscillation of the normal growth rates as a result of the interfacial adsorption of these protein molecules, which is a newly discovered impurity effect for crystal growth. As the convection caused by gravity may mitigate or modify this effect, secure observations of this effect were first made possible by continuous measurements of normal growth rates under longterm microgravity condition realized only in the spacecraft. Our findings will lead to a better understanding of a novel kinetic process for growth oscillation in relation to growth promotion due to the adsorption of protein molecules and will shed light on the role that crystal growth kinetics has in the onset of the mysterious antifreeze effect in living organisms, namely, how this protein may prevent fish freezing.",Yoshinori Furukawa; Ken Nagashima; Shunichi Nakatsubo; Izumi Yoshizaki; Haruka Tamaru; Taro Shimaoka; Takehiko Sone; Etsuro Yokoyama; Salvador Zepeda; Takanori Terasawa; Harutoshi Asakawa; Kenichiro Murata; Gen Sazaki,Phase transitions and critical phenomena,"Institute of Low Temperature Science, Hokkaido University, Kitaku, Japan; Institute of Low Temperature Science, Hokkaido University, Kitaku, Japan; Institute of Low Temperature Science, Hokkaido University, Kitaku, Japan; Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency, Japan; Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency, Japan; Japan Space Forum, Chiyodaku, Japan; Japan Manned Space Systems Corporation, Japan; Computer Centre, Gakushuin University, Toshimaku, Japan; Institute of Low Temperature Science, Hokkaido University, Kitaku, Japan; Present address: CCZ Crystal RD, St. Peters, MO 63376, USA.,

Many nontrivial aspects of the vibration dynamics arise from the coexistence of several nonlinearly coupled modes. We show that such coupling can lead to anomalous decay of the modes where they go through nonlinear resonance, so that their amplitudedependent frequencies become commensurate. We demonstrate the possibility of a strongly nonmonotonic dependence of the decay rate on the amplitude if one of the modes serves as a thermal reservoir for another mode. Where the decay of both modes is slow compared to the rate of resonant energy exchange, the decay is accompanied by amplitude oscillations. Depending on the initial conditions, with increasing time it can display an extremely sharp or a comparatively smooth crossover between different regimes. The results provide insight into recent experimental results by several groups and suggest new ways of characterizing and controlling nanomechanical systems.",O. Shoshani; S. W. Shaw; M. I.

Antibodies elicited by vaccines can block the initial phases of parasite infection when sporozoites are deposited into the skin by mosquito bite and then target the liver for further development. However, there are currently no standardized in vivo preclinical models that can measure the inhibitory activity of antibody specificities against Pf sporozoite infection via mosquito bite. Here, we use human liverchimeric mice as a challenge model to assess prevention of natural Pf sporozoite infection by antibodies. We demonstrate that these mice are consistently infected with Pf by mosquito bite and that this challenge can be combined with passive transfer of either monoclonal antibodies or polyclonal human IgG from immune serum to measure antibodymediated blocking of parasite infection using bioluminescent imaging. This methodology is useful to downselect functional antibodies and to investigate mechanisms or immune correlates of protection in clinical trials, thereby informing rational vaccine optimization. Mice containing human liver cells can model earlystage malaria infection and test antibody efficacy. A major obstacle in malaria vaccine development is the lack of relevant preclinical models to study how to prevent malaria infection. Stefan Kappe, of the United States' Center for Infectious Disease Research and the University of Washington, led a collaboration of American and Dutch scientists to overcome this using mice in which the mouse liver cells have been largely replaced with human liver cells. The group demonstrated that their model mirrors infection with the malariacausing parasite Plasmodium falciparum from mosquito bite through the weeklong liver development, and harnessed this to discern the efficacy of different antibodies against the parasite. This research could hugely benefit our understanding of malaria infection and reduce the high failure rate of human vaccine clinical trials.",Brandon K. Sack; Sebastian A.

Indeed, all solutions proposed thus far suffer from at least one of three issues: they are feasible only in a narrow spectral range; the power available for spectroscopy is limited; the frequency accuracy is poor. Here, we present a setup for highresolution spectroscopy, whose approach can be applied in the whole 110 m range. It combines the power of quantum cascade lasers (QCLs) and the accuracy achievable by difference frequency generation using an orientation patterned GaP crystal. The frequency is measured against a primary frequency standard using the Italian metrological fibre link network.

The system contains an interface between an aqueous phase containing Au NPs and an oil phase containing one of various types of amine ligands, and a waterair interface. As the Au NPs diffuse to the wateroil interface, ligand exchange takes place which temporarily traps them at the wateroil interface. The ligandexchanged particles then spontaneously migrate to the airwater interface, where they selfassemble, forming a monolayer under certain conditions. The spontaneous formation of the NP film at the airwater interface was due to the minimization of the system Helmholtz free energy. However, the extent of surface functionalization was dictated by kinetics. This decouples interfacial ligand exchange from interfacial selfassembly, while maintaining the simplicity of a single system. The interparticle centertocenter distance was dictated by the amine ligand length. The Au NP monolayers exhibit tunable surface plasma resonance and excellent spatial homogeneity, which is useful for surfaceenhanced Raman scattering. The ""airwateroil"" selfassembly method developed here not only benefits the fundamental understanding of NP ligand conformations, but is also applicable to the manufacture of plasmonic nanoparticle devices with precisely designed optical properties.",Guang Yang; Daniel T.

Here, we report a lowcesium rice mutant 1 (lcs1) with the radiocesium concentration in grain about half that in the wildtype cultivar. Genetic analyses revealed that a mutation in OsSOS2, which encodes a serinethreonineprotein kinase required for the salt overly sensitive (SOS) pathway in plants, is responsible for the decreased cesium (Cs) concentrations in lcs1. Physiological analyses showed that Cs uptake by lcs1 roots was significantly decreased under lowpotassium (K) conditions in the presence of sodium (Na) (low KNa). The transcript levels of several K and Na transporter genes, such as OsHAK1, OsHAK5, OsAKT1, and OsHKT2;1 were significantly downregulated in lcs1 grown at low KNa. The decreased Cs uptake in lcs1 might be closely related to the lower expression of these genes due to the KNa imbalance in the lcs1 roots caused by the OsSOS2 mutation. Since the lcs1 plant had no significant negative effects on agronomic traits when grown in radiocesiumcontaminated paddy fields, this mutant could be used directly in agriculture for reducing radiocesium in rice grains.",Satoru Ishikawa; Shimpei Hayashi; Tadashi Abe; Masato Igura; Masato Kuramata; Hachidai Tanikawa; Manaka Iino; Takashi Saito; Yuji Ono; Tetsuya Ishikawa; Shigeto Fujimura; Akitoshi Goto; Hiroki Takagi,Plant genetics; Plant physiology,"Institute for AgroEnvironmental Sciences, National Agriculture and Food Research Organization (NARO), Tsukuba, Japan; Institute for AgroEnvironmental Sciences, National Agriculture and Food Research Organization (NARO), Tsukuba, Japan; Institute of Agrobiological Sciences, NARO, Tsukuba, Japan; Institute for AgroEnvironmental Sciences, National Agriculture and Food Research Organization (NARO), Tsukuba, Japan; Institute for AgroEnvironmental Sciences, National Agriculture and Food Research Organization (NARO), Tsukuba, Japan; Institute for AgroEnvironmental Sciences, National Agriculture and Food Research Organization (NARO), Tsukuba, Japan; Institute for AgroEnvironmental Sciences, National Agriculture and Food Research Organization (NARO), Tsukuba, Japan; Institute for AgroEnvironmental Sciences, National Agriculture and Food Research Organization (NARO), Tsukuba, Japan; Hama Agricultural Regeneration Research Centre, Fukushima Agricultural Technology Centre, Minamisoma, Japan; Fruit Tree Research Centre, Fukushima Agricultural Technology Centre, Fukushima, Japan; Tohoku Agricultural Research Center, NARO, Fukushima, Japan; Tohoku Agricultural Research Center, NARO, Fukushima, Japan; Institute of Crop Science, NARO, Tsukuba, Japan; Iwate Biotechnology Research Center, Kitakami, Japan; Ishikawa Prefectural University, Ishikawa, Japan"

This pleiotropic kinase has been implicated in various agerelated diseases including tumorigenesis, neurodegeneration and diabetes. Accordingly, 6BIO has shown antitumor and antineurodegenerative activities; nevertheless, the potential role of 6BIO in normal human cells senescence remains largely unknown. We report herein that treatment of human diploid skin fibroblasts with 6BIO reduced the oxidative load, conferred protection against oxidative stressmediated DNA damage, and it also promoted the activation of antioxidant and proteostatic modules; these effects were largely phenocopied by genetic inhibition of Gsk3. Furthermore, prolonged treatment of cells with 6BIO, although it decreased the rate of cell cycling, it significantly suppressed cellular senescencerelated accumulation of biomolecular damage. Taken together, our presented findings suggest that 6BIO is a novel activator of antioxidant responses and of the proteostasis network in normal human cells; moreover, and given the low levels of biomolecules damage in 6BIO treated senescing cells, this compound likely exerts antitumor properties.",Aimilia D.

f955eec509024fba9392e32652b78fbf,A method for imaging and spectroscopy using rays and magnetic resonance,"A new imaging and spectroscopy approach combines the ability of magnetic resonance imaging to manipulate nuclear spins with the high sensitivity of ray detection, enabling a greatly reduced number of nuclei to be used compared to conventional NMR signal detection. Yuan Zheng and colleagues have devised a new imaging and spectroscopy approach that combines the ability of magnetic resonance imaging to manipulate nuclear spins with the high sensitivity of ray detectors. In their scheme, dubbed polarized nuclear imaging or PNI, a small quantity of a radioactive tracer is introduced into the system, the polarization of which is then manipulated by conventional nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) techniques. But rather than detecting weak radiofrequency signals associated with these tracers, PNI works by monitoring the anisotropic ray emissions from the highly polarized nucleiand as single rays can be detected, the amount of tracer required is greatly reduced compared to conventional NMR signal detection. The new method should have immediate nonbiological imaging and spectroscopy applications, and could perhaps eventually be used in medical diagnostics. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) provides fine spatial resolution, spectral sensitivity and a rich variety of contrast mechanisms for diagnostic medical applications1,2. Nuclear imaging using ray cameras offers the benefits of using small quantities of radioactive tracers that seek specific targets of interest within the body3. Here we describe an imaging and spectroscopic modality that combines favourable aspects of both approaches. Spatial information is encoded into the spin orientations of tiny amounts of a polarized radioactive tracer using pulses of both radiofrequency electromagnetic radiation and magneticfield gradients, as in MRI. However, rather than detecting weak radiofrequency signals, imaging information is obtained through the detection of rays. A single ray detector can be used to acquire an image; no ray camera is needed. We demonstrate the feasibility of our technique by producing images and spectra from a glass cell containing only about 4  1013 atoms (about 1 millicurie) of the metastable isomer 131mXe that were polarized using the laser technique of spinexchange optical pumping4. If the cell had instead been filled with water and imaged using conventional MRI, then it would have contained more than 1024 water molecules. The high sensitivity of our modality expands the breadth of applications of magnetic resonance, and could lead to a new class of radioactive tracers.",Yuan Zheng; G. Wilson Miller; William A.

Given ethical concerns and costs associated with nonhuman primate models, humanized mouse models containing chimeric human livers offer a valuable alternative as small animal models of liver stage human malaria. The best available human liver chimeric mice rely on cellular transplantation into mice with genetically engineered liver injury, but these systems involve a long and variable humanization process, are expensive, and require the use of breedingchallenged mouse strains which are not widely accessible. We previously incorporated primary human hepatocytes into engineered polyethylene glycol (PEG)based nanoporous human ectopic artificial livers (HEALs), implanted them in mice without liver injury, and rapidly generated human liver chimeric mice in a reproducible and scalable fashion. By redesigning the PEG scaffold to be macroporous, we demonstrate the facile fabrication of implantable porous HEALs that support liver stage human malaria (P. falciparum) infection in vitro, and also after implantation in mice with normal liver function, 60% of the time. This proofofconcept study demonstrates the feasibility of applying a tissue engineering strategy towards the development of scalable preclinical models of liver stage malaria infection for future applications.",Shengyong Ng; Sandra March; Ani Galstian; Nil Gural; Kelly R.

In response marine protected areas (MPAs) have increasingly been adopted as the flagship approach to marine conservation, many covering enormous areas. At present, however, the lack of biological sampling makes prioritising which regions of the ocean to protect, especially over large spatial scales, particularly problematic. Here we present an interdisciplinary approach to marine landscape mapping at the subAntarctic island of South Georgia as an effective protocol for underpinning largescale (105106  km2) MPA designations. We have developed a new highresolution (100 m) digital elevation model (DEM) of the region and integrated this DEM with bathymetryderived parameters, modelled oceanographic data, and satellite primary productivity data. These interdisciplinary datasets were used to apply an objective statistical approach to hierarchically partition and map the benthic environment into physical habitats types. We assess the potential application of physical habitat classifications as proxies for biological structuring and the application of the landscape mapping for informing on marine spatial planning.",Oliver T.

In this study, we identified potential A (HD1 and HD2) and B (pheromone precursors and pheromone receptors) mating genes in M. roreri. A PCRbased method was subsequently devised to determine the mating type for a set of 47 isolates from across the geographic range of the fungus. We developed and generated an 11marker microsatellite set and conducted association and linkage disequilibrium (standardized index of association, IAs) analyses. We also performed an ancestral reconstruction analysis to show that the ancestor of M. roreri is predicted to be heterothallic and tetrapolar, which together with sliding window analyses support that the A and B mating loci are likely unlinked and follow a tetrapolar organization within the genome. The A locus is composed of a pair of HD1 and HD2 genes, whereas the B locus consists of a paired pheromone precursor, Mr_Ph4, and receptor, STE3_Mr4. Two A and B alleles but only two mating types were identified. Association analyses divided isolates into two welldefined genetically distinct groups that correlate with their mating type; IAs values show high linkage disequilibrium as is expected in clonal reproduction. Interestingly, both mating types were found in South American isolates but only one mating type was found in Central American isolates, supporting a prior hypothesis of clonal dissemination throughout Central America after a single or very few introductions of the fungus from South America.",J R DiazValderrama; M C Aime,Fungal biology,"Department of Botany and Plant Pathology, Purdue University, West Lafayette, USA; Department of Botany and Plant Pathology, Purdue University, West Lafayette, USA"

RNA structures within these segments and complementary (cRNA) and proteincoding mRNAs may play a role in virus replication. Here, conserved putative secondary structures that impose significant evolutionary constraints on the gene segment encoding the surface glycoprotein hemagglutinin (HA) were investigated using available sequence data on tens of thousands of virus strains. Structural constraints were identified by analysis of covariations of nucleotides suggested to be paired by structure prediction algorithms. The significance of covariations was estimated by mutual information calculations and tracing multiple covariation events during virus evolution. Covariation patterns demonstrated that structured domains in HA RNAs were mostly subtypespecific, whereas some structures were conserved in several subtypes. The influence of RNA folding on virus replication was studied by plaque assays of mutant viruses with disrupted structures. The results suggest that over the whole length of the HA segment there are local structured domains which contribute to the virus fitness but individually are not essential for the virus. Existence of subtypespecific structured regions in the segments of the influenza A virus genome is apparently an important factor in virus evolution and reassortment of its genes.",Alexander P.

Inflammation and oxidative stress are key players in ischemic injuries. Following retinal ischemia, vascular endothelial cells and leukocytes express several inflammatory adhesion receptors, such as selectins and cell adhesion molecules. Pselectin stimulates leukocyte recruitment to platelet aggregates and has an important role in vascular homeostasis and inflammatory leukocyte extravasation. Soluble Pselectin can be neuroprotective through competitive binding to the receptors of endogenous Pselectin molecules. Here, we demonstrate the neuroprotective effect of a recombinant Pselectin immunoglobin G (PselIgG) chimeric fusion protein in a rat anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (rAION) model. rAION was induced by photodynamic therapy. PselIgG treatment reduced optic nerve edema and stabilized the bloodoptic nerve barrier (BONB) in the acute phase of rAION. Further, PselIgG increased the retinal ganglion cell (RGC) survival rate, reduced RGC apoptosis, preserved visual function, maintained retinal nerve fiber layer thickness, and reduced macrophage infiltration in optic nerve tissue in the chronic phase (day 28). Increased NAD(P)H quinone dehydrogenase 1 (NQO1) and heme oxygenase 1(HO1) expression levels, along with increased transcription factor Nrf2, suggesting an antioxidant role of PselIgG via the Nrf2 signaling pathway. In conclusion, this study is the first to demonstrate that PselIgG treatment promotes RGC survival by stabilizing the BONB and activating the Nrf2 signaling pathway in a rAION model.",Kishan Kapupara; YaoTseng Wen; RongKung Tsai; ShunPing Huang,Cell signalling; Mechanism of action; Recombinant protein therapy; Retinal diseases,"Department of Molecular Biology and Human Genetics, Tzu Chi University, Hualien, Taiwan; Institute of Eye Research, Buddhist Tzu Chi General Hospital, Hualien, Taiwan; Institute of Eye Research, Buddhist Tzu Chi General Hospital, Hualien, Taiwan; Institute of Medical Sciences, Tzu Chi University, Hualien, Taiwan; Department of Molecular Biology and Human Genetics, Tzu Chi University, Hualien, Taiwan"

This paper demonstrates an alternative platform, which we call iTAG (implantable thermally actuated gel), where an implanted capsule can be wirelessly controlled by ultrasound to trigger the release of compounds. We constructed a millimetersized capsule containing a copolymer gel (NiPAAmcoAAm) that contracts above body temperature (i.e. at 45 C) to release compounds through an opening. This gelcontaining capsule is biocompatible and free of toxic electronic or battery components. An ultrasound hardware, with a focused ultrasound (FUS) transducer and a coaxial Amode imaging transducer, was used to image the capsule (to monitor in real time its position, temperature, and effectiveness of dose delivery), as well as to trigger a rapid local rise in temperature, contraction of gel, and release of compounds in vitro and in vivo. The combination of this gelbased capsule and compact ultrasound hardware can serve as a platform for triggering local release of compounds, including potentially in deep tissue, to achieve tailored personalized therapy.",Olga Ordeig; Sau Yin Chin; Sohyun Kim; Parag V.

Here we demonstrate that following oxidative stress, hSSB1 is stabilized as an oligomer which is required for hSSB1 to function in the removal of 8oxoguanine. Monomeric hSSB1 shows a decreased affinity for oxidized DNA resulting in a cellular 8oxoguaninerepair defect and in the absence of ATM signaling initiation. While hSSB1 oligomerization is important for the removal of 8oxoguanine from the genome, it is not required for the repair of doublestrand DNAbreaks by homologous recombination.

Further plasticity is displayed through their ability to be polarized as subtypes M1 and M2 in a cell culture microenvironment. However, the detailed regulation of eicosanoid production and its involvement in macrophage biology remains unclear. Using a lipidomics approach, we demonstrated that eicosanoid production profiles between bone marrowderived (BMDM) and peritoneal macrophages differed drastically. In polarized BMDMs, M1 and M2 phenotypes were distinguished by thromboxane B2, prostaglandin (PG) E2, and PGD2 production, in addition to lysophospholipid acyltransferase activity. Although Alox5 expression and the presence of 5lipoxygenase (5LO) protein in BMDMs was observed, the absence of leukotrienes production reflected an impairment in 5LO activity, which could be triggered by addition of exogenous arachidonic acid (AA). The BMDM 5LO regulatory mechanism was not responsive to PGE2cAMP pathway modulation; however, treatment to reduce glutathione peroxidase activity increased 5LO metabolite production after AA stimulation.

During MAC assembly, multiple copies of C9 are sequentially recruited to membrane associated C5b8 to form a pore. Here we determined the 2.2 A crystal structure of monomeric murine C9 and the 3.9 A resolution cryo EM structure of C9 in a polymeric assembly. Comparison with other MAC proteins reveals that the first transmembrane region (TMH1) in monomeric C9 is uniquely positioned and functions to inhibit its selfassembly in the absence of C5b8. We further show that following C9 recruitment to C5b8, a conformational change in TMH1 permits unidirectional and sequential binding of additional C9 monomers to the growing MAC. This mechanism of pore formation contrasts with related proteins, such as perforin and the cholesterol dependent cytolysins, where it is believed that prepore assembly occurs prior to the simultaneous release of the transmembrane regions. The Complement component 9 (C9) is the poreforming component of the Membrane Attack Complex which targets pathogens.

For decades, conventional nonlinear elasticity models have predicted that this thermal resistance is only appreciable when the heat flux is perpendicular to the dislocations. However, this dislocationinduced anisotropic thermal transport has yet to be seen experimentally. Using timedomain thermoreflectance, we measure strong thermal transport anisotropy governed by highly oriented threading dislocation arrays throughout micrometrethick, singlecrystal indium nitride films. We find that the crossplane thermal conductivity is almost tenfold higher than the inplane thermal conductivity at 80 K when the dislocation density is ~3  1010 cm2. This large anisotropy is not predicted by conventional models. With enhanced understanding of dislocationphonon interactions, our results may allow the tailoring of anisotropic thermal transport with line defects, and could facilitate methods for directed heat dissipation in the thermal management of diverse device applications. Thermal management can improve device function, but the role of dislocations is poorly understood.

Various Pd loadings were employed to produce surfacemodified ZnO nanostructure sensors, and their resulting NH3 sensing capabilities both in dry and humid environments were investigated. Through a comparative gas sensing study between the pure and Pdloaded ZnO sensors upon exposure to NH3 at an optimal operating temperature of 350 C, the Pdloaded ZnO sensors were found to exhibit enhanced sensor responses and fast responserecovery times. The influence of Pd loading and its successful incorporation into ZnO nanostructure was examined by Xray diffraction, high resolutiontransmission electron microscopy, and Xray photoelectron spectroscopy.

Here, we show that this occurs through a twostep process that requires both adrenergicdependent phosphorylation of S265 and demethylation of H3K9me2 by JMJD1A. The histone demethylationindependent acute Ucp1 induction in BAT and demethylationdependent chronic Ucp1 expression in beige scWAT provides complementary molecular mechanisms to ensure an ordered transition between acute and chronic adaptation to cold stress. JMJD1A mediates two major signaling pathways, namely, adrenergic receptor and peroxisome proliferatoractivated receptor (PPAR) activation, via PRDM16PPARPJMJD1A complex for beige adipogenesis. S265 phosphorylation of JMJD1A, and the following demethylation of H3K9me2 might prove to be a novel molecular target for the treatment of metabolic disorders, via promoting beige adipogenesis. JMJD1A is essential for thermogenic gene induction in brown adipose tissue. Here the authors show that white adipose tissue beigeing requires both adrenergicdependent phosphorylation of S265 and demethylation activity of JMJD1A while brown adipose tissuedriven thermogenesis requires adrenergic dependent phosphorylation of S265 but is independent of H3K9me2 demethylation.",Yohei Abe; Yosuke Fujiwara; Hiroki Takahashi; Yoshihiro Matsumura; Tomonobu Sawada; Shuying Jiang; Ryo Nakaki; Aoi Uchida; Noriko Nagao; Makoto Naito; Shingo Kajimura; Hiroshi Kimura; Timothy F.

Clinically used endotamponade agents act through buoyancy forces, yet can result in prolonged postoperative positioning, temporary loss of vision, raised intraocular pressure, cataract formation or the need for additional removal surgery. Here, we describe a thermogelling polymer that provides an internal tamponade effect through surface tension and swelling counterforces. We tested the longterm biocompatibility of the polymer endotamponade in rabbit vitrectomy models, and its surgical efficacy and biocompatibility in a nonhuman primate retinaldetachment model. We also show that, while the thermogel biodegrades during the three months following surgery, it promotes the reformation of a vitreouslike body that mimics the biophysical properties of the natural vitreous. The thermogelling endotamponade might serve as a longterm vitreous substitute. A thermogelling polymer that acts as an internal tamponade can repair detached retinas and trigger the formation of a vitreouslike body, as shown in retinaldetachment rabbit and nonhumanprimate models.",Zengping Liu; Sing Shy Liow; Siew Li Lai; Asfa AlliShaik; Graham E.

We previously reported synthetic, twodimensional protein lattices selfassembled via disulfide bonding interactions, which endows them with a unique capacity to undergo coherent conformational changes without losing crystalline order. Here, we carried out allatom molecular dynamics simulations to map the freeenergy landscape of these lattices, validated this landscape through extensive structural characterization by electron microscopy and established that it is predominantly governed by solvent reorganization entropy. Subsequent redesign of the protein surface with conditionally repulsive electrostatic interactions enabled us to predictably perturb the freeenergy landscape and obtain a new protein lattice whose conformational dynamics can be chemically and mechanically toggled between three different states with varying porosities and molecular densities. Living systems rely on externally tuneable and stimuliresponsive conformational changes of proteins and protein assemblies for a wide range of essential functions. A combination of experimental and computational analyses has now enabled the fabrication of a rationally designed, synthetic, stimuliresponsive protein assembly through modulation of its freeenergy landscape.

f8bb4a3ce9fb4e1cbcf54864df3f2772,CAT tails drive degradation of stalled polypeptides on and off the ribosome,"Stalled translation produces incomplete, ribosometethered polypeptides that the ribosomeassociated quality control (RQC) pathway targets for degradation via the E3 ubiquitin ligase Ltn1. During this process, the protein Rqc2 and the large ribosomal subunit elongate stalled polypeptides with carboxyterminal alanine and threonine residues (CAT tails). Failure to degrade CATtailed proteins disrupts global protein homeostasis, as CATtailed proteins can aggregate and sequester chaperones. Why cells employ such a potentially toxic process during RQC is unclear. Here, we developed quantitative techniques to assess how CAT tails affect stalled polypeptide degradation in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We found that CAT tails enhance the efficiency of Ltn1 in targeting structured polypeptides, which are otherwise poor Ltn1 substrates. If Ltn1 fails to ubiquitylate those stalled polypeptides or becomes limiting, CAT tails act as degrons, marking proteins for proteasomal degradation off the ribosome. Thus, CAT tails functionalize the carboxy termini of stalled polypeptides to drive their degradation on and off the ribosome. Alanine and threonine residues added to the C terminus of stalled nascent chains (CAT tails) increase degradation of such polypeptides by promoting their ubiquitylation by Ltn1 or by acting as degrons off the ribosome.",Cole S.

To investigate interfacial dynamical transitions of charged quasiparticles, however, remains a grand challenge. By employing ultrafast midinfrared microspectroscopic probes to detect excitonic internal quantum transitions and twodimensional atomic device fabrications, we are able to directly monitor the interplay between free carriers and insulating interlayer excitons between two atomic layers. Our observations reveal unexpected ultrafast formation of tightly bound interlayer excitons between conducting graphene and semiconducting MoSe2. The result suggests carriers in the doped graphene are no longer massless, and an effective mass as small as one percent of free electron mass is sufficient to confine carriers within a 2D hetero space with energy 10 times larger than the roomtemperature thermal energy. The interlayer excitons arise within 1 ps. Their formation effectively blocks charge recombination and improves charge separation efficiency for more than one order of magnitude.

This characteristic is lost when cells undergo malignant transformation, leading to uncontrolled proliferation and solid tumor formation. Here we report that autophagy is compromised in contactinhibited cells in 2D or 3Dsoft extracellular matrix cultures. In such cells, YAPTAZ fail to cotranscriptionally regulate the expression of myosinII genes, resulting in the loss of Factin stress fibers, which impairs autophagosome formation. The decreased proliferation resulting from contact inhibition is partly autophagydependent, as is their increased sensitivity to hypoxia and glucose starvation. These findings define how mechanically repressed YAPTAZ activity impacts autophagy to contribute to core phenotypes resulting from high cell confluence that are lost in various cancers. At high cell density or when plated on soft matrix, YAPTAZ are redistributed from the nucleus to the cytosol, becoming transcriptionally inactive. Here the authors show that at high cell density, autophagosome formation is impaired due to reduced YAPTAZdependent transcription of actomyosin genes",Mariana Pavel; Maurizio Renna; So Jung Park; Fiona M.

Yet, despite the essential functional roles they fill, very little is known about the physiology of astrocytes in the ventral midbrain, a region that houses dopaminereleasing neurons and is critical for reward learning and motivated behaviors. Here, using a combination of wholetranscriptome sequencing, histology, slice electrophysiology, and calcium imaging, we performed the first functional and molecular profiling of ventral midbrain astrocytes and observed numerous differences between these cells and their telencephalic counterparts, both in their gene expression profile and in their physiological properties. Ventral midbrain astrocytes have very low membrane resistance and inwardrectifying potassium channelmediated current, and are extensively coupled to surrounding oligodendrocytes through gap junctions. They exhibit calcium responses to glutamate but are relatively insensitive to norepinephrine. In addition, their calcium activity can be dynamically modulated by dopamine D2 receptor signaling. Taken together, these data indicate that ventral midbrain astrocytes are physiologically distinct from astrocytes in cortex and hippocampus. This work provides new insights into the extent of functional astrocyte heterogeneity within the adult brain and establishes the foundation for examining the impact of regional astrocyte differences on dopamine neuron function and susceptibility to degeneration.",Wendy Xin; Kornel E.

Here, we report the observation of a bulk DMI in GdFeCo amorphous ferrimagnets. The DMI is found to increase linearly with an increasing thickness of the ferrimagnetic layer, which is a clear signature of the bulk nature of DMI. We also found that the DMI is independent of the interface between the heavy metal and ferrimagnetic layer. This bulk DMI is attributed to an asymmetric distribution of the elemental content in the GdFeCo layer, with spatial inversion symmetry broken throughout the layer. We expect that our experimental identification of a bulk DMI will open up additional possibilities to exploit this interaction in a wide range of materials.

Exposure to cosmic radiation can cause longterm cognitive impairments in rodent models thereby presenting potential obstacles for astronauts engaged in deep space travel. The mechanisms for how cosmic radiation induces cognitive deficits are currently unknown. We find that temporary microglia depletion, one week after cosmic radiation, prevents the development of longterm memory deficits. Gene array profiling reveals that acute microglia depletion alters the late neuroinflammatory response to cosmic radiation. The repopulated microglia present a modified functional phenotype with reduced expression of scavenger receptors, lysosome membrane protein and complement receptor, all shown to be involved in microgliasynapses interaction.

The mechanisms enabling adaptation to MYCinduced stress are not fully understood. Here we reveal an essential role for activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4) in survival following MYC activation. MYC upregulates ATF4 by activating general control nonderepressible 2 (GCN2) kinase through uncharged transfer RNAs. Subsequently, ATF4 cooccupies promoter regions of over 30 MYCtarget genes, primarily those regulating amino acid and protein synthesis, including eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4Ebinding protein 1 (4EBP1), a negative regulator of translation. 4EBP1 relieves MYCinduced proteotoxic stress and is essential to balance protein synthesis. 4EBP1 activity is negatively regulated by mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1)dependent phosphorylation and inhibition of mTORC1 signalling rescues ATF4deficient cells from MYCinduced endoplasmic reticulum stress. Acute deletion of ATF4 significantly delays MYCdriven tumour progression and increases survival in mouse models. Our results establish ATF4 as a cellular rheostat of MYC activity, which ensures that enhanced translation rates are compatible with survival and tumour progression. Activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4) promotes MYCdriven tumour progression.

ae6fa8bd9da34d8e97fa6f2405f6495a,"Artifact Rejection Methodology Enables Continuous, Noninvasive Measurement of Gastric Myoelectric Activity in Ambulatory Subjects","The increasing prevalence of functional and motility gastrointestinal (GI) disorders is at odds with bottlenecks in their diagnosis, treatment, and followup. Lack of noninvasive approaches means that only specialized centers can perform objective assessment procedures. Abnormal GI muscular activity, which is coordinated by electrical slowwaves, may play a key role in symptoms. As such, the electrogastrogram (EGG), a noninvasive means to continuously monitor gastric electrical activity, can be used to inform diagnoses over broader populations. However, it is seldom used due to technical issues: inconsistent results from singlechannel measurements and signal artifacts that make interpretation difficult and limit prolonged monitoring. Here, we overcome these limitations with a wearable multichannel system and artifact removal signal processing methods. Our approach yields an increase of 0.56 in the mean correlation coefficient between EGG and the clinical ""gold standard"", gastric manometry, across 11 subjects (p  0.001). We also demonstrate this system's usage for ambulatory monitoring, which reveals myoelectric dynamics in response to meals akin to gastric emptying patterns and circadianrelated oscillations.

How information is turned to decision remains unknown. By combining stochastic mathematical modelling and experimentation, we demonstrate that feedback interactions between the IRF3, NFB and STAT pathways lead to switchlike responses to a viral analogue, poly(I:C), in contrast to pulselike responses to bacterial LPS. Poly(I:C) activates both IRF3 and NFB, a requirement for induction of IFN expression. Autocrine IFN initiates a JAKSTATmediated positivefeedback stabilising nuclear IRF3 and NFB in first responder cells. Paracrine IFN, in turn, sensitises second responder cells through a JAKSTATmediated positive feedforward pathway that upregulates the positivefeedback components: RIGI, PKR and OAS1A. In these sensitised cells, the 'liveordie' decision phase following poly(I:C) exposure is shorterthey rapidly produce antiviral responses and commit to apoptosis. The interlinked positive feedback and feedforward signalling is key for coordinating cell fate decisions in cellular populations restricting pathogen spread.

However, their exceptional nonlinear properties have not been fully exploited in nanophotonics yet. Herein we fabricate methyl ammonium lead tribromide perovskite metasurfaces and explore their internal nonlinear processes. While both of thirdorder harmonic generation and threephoton luminescence are generated, the latter one is less affected by the material loss and has been significantly enhanced by a factor of 60. The corresponding simulation reveals that the improvement is caused by the resonant enhancement of incident laser. Interestingly, such kind of resonanceenhanced threephoton luminescence holds true for metasurfaces with a small period number of 4, enabling promising applications of perovskite metasurface in highresolution nonlinear color nanoprinting and optical encoding. The encoded information 'NANO' is visible only when the incident laser is onresonance. The offresonance pumping and the singlephoton excitation just produce a uniform dark or photoluminescence background. Lead halide perovskites attract high interest as semiconductor materials but their exceptional nonlinear properties have not been fully exploited.

However, only a fraction of the hundreds of nominated ASDrelated genes have identified de novo or transmitted loss of function (LOF) mutations that can be directly attributed to the disorder. For this reason, a means of prioritizing candidate genes for ASD would help filter out falsepositive results and allow researchers to focus on genes that are more likely to be causative. Here we constructed a machine learning model by leveraging a brainspecific functional relationship network (FRN) of genes to produce a genomewide ranking of ASD risk genes. We rigorously validated our gene ranking using results from two independent sequencing experiments, together representing over 5000 simplex and multiplex ASD families. Finally, through functional enrichment analysis on our highly prioritized candidate gene network, we identified a small number of pathways that are key in early neural development, providing further support for their potential role in ASD.",Marlena Duda; Hongjiu Zhang; HongDong Li; Dennis P.

2752b55a0fb4490fa04edc603418da00,Amygdala hyperconnectivity in a mouse model of unpredictable early life stress,"Childhood maltreatment is associated with a wide range of psychopathologies including anxiety that emerge in childhood and in many cases persist in adulthood. Increased amygdala activation in response to threat and abnormal amygdala connectivity with frontolimbic brain regions, such as the hippocampus and the prefrontal cortex, are some of the most consistent findings seen in individuals exposed to childhood maltreatment. The underlying mechanisms responsible for these changes are difficult to study in humans but can be elucidated using animal models of earlylife stress. Such studies are especially powerful in the mouse where precise control of the genetic background and the stress paradigm can be coupled with restingstate fMRI (rsfMRI) to map abnormal connectivity in circuits that regulate anxiety. To address this issue we first compared the effects of two models of earlylife stress, limited bedding (LB) and unpredictable postnatal stress (UPS), on anxietylike behavior in juvenile and adult mice. We found that UPS, but not LB, causes a robust increase in anxiety in juvenile and adult male mice. Next, we used rsfMRI to compare frontolimbic connectivity in control and UPS adult male mice. We found increased amygdalaprefrontal cortex and amygdalahippocampus connectivity in UPS. The strength of the amygdalahippocampal and amygdalaprefrontal cortex connectivity was highly correlated with anxietylike behavior in the openfield test and elevated plus maze. These findings are the first to link hyperconnectivity in frontolimbic circuits and increased anxiety in a mouse model of earlylife stress, allowing for more mechanistic understanding of parallel findings in humans.",Frances K.

6e59003b625940f18b2e2a1368953c8a,Epigenomewide association study of adiposity and future risk of obesityrelated diseases,"Obesity is an established risk factor for several common chronic diseases such as breast and colorectal cancer, metabolic and cardiovascular diseases; however, the biological basis for these relationships is not fully understood. To explore the association of obesity with these conditions, we investigated peripheral blood leucocyte (PBL) DNA methylation markers for adiposity and their contribution to risk of incident breast and colorectal cancer and myocardial infarction. DNA methylation profiles (Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip) from 1941 individuals from four populationbased European cohorts were analysed in relation to body mass index, waist circumference, waisthip and waistheight ratio within a metaanalytical framework. In a subset of these individuals, data on genomewide gene expression level, biomarkers of glucose and lipid metabolism were also available. Validation of methylation markers associated with all adiposity measures was performed in 358 individuals. Finally, we investigated the association of obesityrelated methylation marks with breast, colorectal cancer and myocardial infarction within relevant subsets of the discovery population. We identified 40 CpG loci with methylation levels associated with at least one adiposity measure. Of these, one CpG locus (cg06500161) in ABCG1 was associated with all four adiposity measures (P  9.07108 to 3.271018) and lower transcriptional activity of the fulllength isoform of ABCG1 (P  6.00107), higher triglyceride levels (P  5.37109) and higher triglyceridestoHDL cholesterol ratio (P  1.031010). Of the 40 informative and obesityrelated CpG loci, two (in IL2RB and FGF18) were significantly associated with colorectal cancer (inversely, P  1.6103) and one intergenic locus on chromosome 1 was inversely associated with myocardial infarction (P  1.25103), independently of obesity and established risk factors. Our results suggest that epigenetic changes, in particular altered DNA methylation patterns, may be an intermediate biomarker at the intersection of obesity and obesityrelated diseases, and could offer clues as to underlying biological mechanisms.",Gianluca Campanella; Marc J.

27b5fefa593343b09a44dfddf0a1006f,TAp63 contributes to sexual dimorphism in POMC neuron functions and energy homeostasis,"Sexual dimorphism exists in energy balance, but the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Here we show that the female mice have more proopiomelanocortin (POMC) neurons in the arcuate nucleus of hypothalamus than males, and female POMC neurons display higher neural activities, compared to male counterparts. Strikingly, deletion of the transcription factor, TAp63, in POMC neurons confers ""malelike"" dietinduced obesity (DIO) in female mice associated with decreased POMC neural activities; but the same deletion does not affect male mice. Our results indicate that TAp63 in female POMC neurons contributes to the enhanced POMC neuron functions and resistance to obesity in females. Thus, TAp63 in POMC neurons is one key molecular driver for the sexual dimorphism in energy homeostasis. Sexual dimorphism exists in a number of physiological processes, including energy homeostasis. Here, the authors show that proopiomelanocortin neurons in female mice fire more rapidly than males, and that deletion of the transcription TAp63 leads to a reduced neuronal firing rate and a malelike susceptibility to dietinduced obesity.",Chunmei Wang; Yanlin He; Pingwen Xu; Yongjie Yang; Kenji Saito; Yan Xia; Xiaofeng Yan; Antentor Hinton Jr; Chunling Yan; Hongfang Ding; Likai Yu; Gang Shu; Rajat Gupta; Qi Wu; Qingchun Tong; William R.

f3241957673b44eaa74f55e5b524539e,Rice actin binding protein RMD controls crown root angle in response to external phosphate,"Root angle has a major impact on acquisition of nutrients like phosphate that accumulate in topsoil and in many species; low phosphate induces shallower root growth as an adaptive response. Identifying genes and mechanisms controlling root angle is therefore of paramount importance to plant breeding. Here we show that the actinbinding protein Rice Morphology Determinant (RMD) controls root growth angle by linking actin filaments and gravitysensing organelles termed statoliths. RMD is upregulated in response to low external phosphate and mutants lacking of RMD have steeper crown root growth angles that are unresponsive to phosphate levels. RMD protein localizes to the surface of statoliths, and rmd mutants exhibit faster gravitropic response owing to more rapid statoliths movement. We conclude that adaptive changes to root angle in response to external phosphate availability are RMD dependent, providing a potential target for breeders. The orientation of plant roots responds to gravity and influences nutrient acquisition. Here the authors show that the formin RMD buffers movement of specialized gravitysensing organelles and report enhanced RMD expression during phosphate deficiency that could alter root angle to improve phosphate uptake.",Guoqiang Huang; Wanqi Liang; Craig J.

However, the colloidal synthesis of 2D quaternary chalcogenide nanomaterials remains a great challenge owing to the lack of intrinsic driving force for its anisotropic growth. 2D wurtzite Cu2ZnSnS4 nanosheets (CZTSNS) with highenergy (002) facets have been obtained for the first time via a simple onepot thermal decomposition method. The CZTSNS exhibits superior photoelectrochemical activity as compared to zerodimensional CZTS nanospheres and comparable performance to Pt counter electrode for dye sensitized solar cells. The improved catalytic activity can be attributed to additional reactive catalytic sites and higher catalytic reactivity in highenergy (002) facets of 2D CZTSNS. This is in accordance with the density functional theory (DFT) calculations, which indicates that the (002) facets of wurtzite CZTSNS possess higher surface energy and exhibits remarkable reducibility for I3

However, it remains unclear which demographic processes generate ASR variation and how biases in ASR in turn affect social behaviour. Here, we evaluate the demographic mechanisms shaping ASR and their potential consequences for parental cooperation using detailed survival, fecundity, and behavioural data on 6119 individuals from six wild shorebird populations exhibiting flexible parental strategies. We show that these closely related populations express strikingly different ASRs, despite having similar ecologies and life histories, and that ASR variation is largely driven by sex differences in the apparent survival of juveniles. Furthermore, families in populations with biased ASRs were predominantly tended by a single parent, suggesting that parental cooperation breaks down with unbalanced sex ratios. Taken together, our results indicate that sex biases emerging during early life have profound consequences for social behaviour. Biases in adult sex ratio (ASR) are common, yet their causes and consequences are not well understood. Here, the authors analyse data from 6000 individuals of five shorebird species, showing that sex differences in juvenile survival drive ASR variation and biased ASR is associated with uniparental care.",Luke J.

Here, we perform structure and interaction mapping on four DENV and ZIKV strains inside virions and in infected cells. Comparative analysis of SHAPE reactivities across serotypes nominates potentially functional regions that are highly structured, conserved, and contain low synonymous mutation rates. Interaction mapping by SPLASH identifies many pairwise interactions, 40% of which form alternative structures, suggesting extensive structural heterogeneity. Analysis of shared interactions between serotypes reveals a conserved macroorganization whereby interactions can be preserved at physical locations beyond sequence identities. We further observe that longerrange interactions are preferentially disrupted inside cells, and show the importance of new interactions in virus fitness. These findings deepen our understanding of Flavivirus genome organization and serve as a resource for designing therapeutics in targeting RNA viruses. Here, the authors provide detailed analyses of viral RNA structure in virions and in infected cells for four dengue virus serotypes and four Zika virus strains, and identify conserved structures that are important for virus replication.",Roland G.

5b12eb2b973948daa201b7a54b9f2787,Longdistance migratory birds threatened by multiple independent risks from global change,"Many species migrate long distances annually between their breeding and wintering areas1. Although global change affects both ranges, impact assessments have generally focused on breeding ranges and ignored how environmental changes influence migrants across geographical regions and the annual cycle2,3. Using range maps and species distribution models, we quantified the risk of summer and winter range loss and migration distance increase from future climate and land cover changes on longdistance migratory birds of the Holarctic (n  715). Risk estimates are largely independent of each other and magnitudes vary geographically. If seasonal range losses and increased migration distances are not considered, we strongly underestimate the number of threatened species by 1849% and the overall magnitude of risk for 1750% species. Many of the analysed species that face multiple global change risks are not listed by International Union for Conservation of Nature as threatened or near threatened. To neglect seasonal migration in impact assessments could thus seriously misguide species' conservation. Climate and landcover change can affect the summer and winter ranges and migration distances of migratory birds. Accounting for all of these factors, rather than just summer range as is typical, significantly increases the number of species under threat.",Damaris Zurell; Catherine H.

A decline in the ageingassociated process of autophagy is suggested as a potential contributor to OA development. Polyamines such as spermidine decrease during ageing, contributing to impaired autophagy and reduced cellular function. However, the role of polyamines and their effect on the regulatory mechanism governing autophagy in aged and arthritic cartilage tissue has not been established. Elucidating if polyamine regulation of autophagy is impaired during ageing and OA in chondrocytes may lead to improved treatment approaches to protect against cartilage degradation. Our results indicate that polyamine synthesis was decreased in aged and OA cartilage, along with reduced autophagy activity, evidenced by decreased autophagyrelated gene and protein expression and autophagosome formation. Importantly, spermidine treatment increased the expression of the acetyltransferase EP300, which binds to crucial autophagy proteins, Beclin1 and LC3, and elevates chondrocyte autophagy. Our data indicate spermidine prevents the ageing and OArelated decrease in autophagy and may protect against OA development. The naturally occurring small molecule spermidine might prevent and repair the cartilage damage in osteoarthritis, commonly associated with aging. Spermidine was first found in semen but is widely distributed in animals and plants and is known to promote longevity in mammals. During normal aging, a process of ""autophagy"" in which cells degrade and recycle used materials is known to decline in chrondrocytes, cells which produce and maintain cartilage. Researchers in the UK led by James Edwards at the University of Oxford have uncovered details of the biochemical mechanisms linking spermidine and autophagy. Treating cultured human and mouse chrondrocytes with spermidine can reverse the decline in autophagy. The researchers identified specific genes and proteins involved in spermidine's effects. Spermidine treatment might restore normal autophagy, combatting osteoarthritis.",Pradeep K. Sacitharan; Seint Lwin; George Bou Gharios; James R.

We analyzed patterns of some disease outbreaks during the strong 20152016 El Nino event in relation to climate anomalies derived from satellite measurements. Disease outbreaks in multiple El Ninoconnected regions worldwide (including Southeast Asia, Tanzania, western US, and Brazil) followed shifts in rainfall, temperature, and vegetation in which both drought and flooding occurred in excess (1481% precipitation departures from normal). These shifts favored ecological conditions appropriate for pathogens and their vectors to emerge and propagate clusters of diseases activity in these regions. Our analysis indicates that intensity of disease activity in some ENSOteleconnected regions were approximately 2.528% higher during years with El Nino events than those without. Plague in Colorado and New Mexico as well as cholera in Tanzania were significantly associated with above normal rainfall (p  0.05); while dengue in Brazil and southeast Asia were significantly associated with above normal land surface temperature (p  0.05). Routine and ongoing global satellite monitoring of key climate variable anomalies calibrated to specific regions could identify regions at risk for emergence and propagation of disease vectors.

5db54ad251354de7a81748814e7b6d7c,"The Boring Billion, a slingshot for Complex Life on Earth","The period 1800 to 800 Ma (""Boring Billion"") is believed to mark a delay in the evolution of complex life, primarily due to low levels of oxygen in the atmosphere. Earlier studies highlight the remarkably flat C, Cr isotopes and low trace element trends during the socalled stasis, caused by prolonged nutrient, climatic, atmospheric and tectonic stability. In contrast, we suggest a firstorder variability of bioessential trace element availability in the oceans by combining systematic sampling of the Proterozoic rock record with sensitive geochemical analyses of marine pyrite by LAICPMS technique. We also recall that several critical biological evolutionary events, such as the appearance of eukaryotes, origin of multicellularity  sexual reproduction, and the first major diversification of eukaryotes (crown group) occurred during this period. Therefore, it appears possible that the period of low nutrient trace elements (18001400 Ma) caused evolutionary pressures which became an essential trigger for promoting biological innovations in the eukaryotic domain. Later periods of stressfree conditions, with relatively high nutrient trace element concentration, facilitated diversification. We propose that the ""Boring Billion"" was a period of sequential stepwise evolution and diversification of complex eukaryotes, triggering evolutionary pathways that made possible the later rise of micrometazoans and their macroscopic counterparts.",Indrani Mukherjee; Ross R.

We utilized a large cohort to investigate the effect of perioperative blood transfusion on cancer prognosis following colorectal cancer (CRC) resection. Patients with stage I through III CRC undergoing tumour resection at a tertiary medical center between 2005 and 2014 were identified and evaluated through August 2016. Propensity score matching was used to cancel out imbalances in patient characteristics. Postoperative diseasefree survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) were analysed using Cox regression model. A total of 4,030 and 972 patients were analysed before and after propensity score matching. Cox regression analyses demonstrated blood transfusion associated with shorter DFS and OS before and after matching (hazard ratio: 1.41, 95% CI: 1.21.66 for DFS; 1.97, 95% CI: 1.62.43 for OS). Larger transfusion volume was linked to higher overall mortality (4 units vs. nil, HR  1.58; 4 units vs. nil, HR  2.32) but not more cancer recurrence. Preoperative anemia was not associated with decreased survival after adjusting covariates. Perioperative blood transfusion was associated with worse cancer prognosis after curative colorectal resection, independently of anemia status.

Eligible were patients aged 18 years allotransplanted for chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) or mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) after prior exposure to ibrutinib who were registered with the EBMT registry. Seventy patients (CLL 48, MCL 22) were included. At the time of alloHCT, 73% of the patients were ibrutinib responsive. All patients except one engrafted, and acute GVHD grade 24 (34) was observed in 49% (12%) of 68 evaluable patients. The cumulative incidence of chronic GVHD was 54% 1 year after transplant. In the CLL group, 12month nonrelapse mortality, relapse incidence (RI), progressionfree survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS) were 10, 30, 60, and 72%, respectively, and in the MCL group 5, 19, 76, and 86%, respectively. Pretransplant ibrutinib failure and poor performance status predicted inferior RI, PFS and OS in the CLL group. In conclusion, ibrutinib does not affect the safety of a subsequent alloHCT. While the relatively high posttransplant relapse risk in ibrutinibexposed patients with CLL deserves further study, in patients with MCL consolidating disease responses to ibrutinib with alloHCT seems to be a promising option.",Peter Dreger; Mauricette Michallet; Paul Bosman; Sascha Dietrich; Mohamad Sobh; Ariane Boumendil; Arnon Nagler; Christof Scheid; Jan Cornelissen; Dietger Niederwieser; Lutz Muller; Elizabeth Vandenberghe; Ilaria Scortechini; Helene Schoemans; Niels S.

The infection of adult ducks with DHAV1 was previously shown to result in transient cytokine storms in their kidneys. To understand how DHAV1 infection impacts the host liver, we conducted animal experiments with the virulent CH DHAV1 strain and the attenuated CH60 commercial vaccine strain. Visual observation and standard hematoxylin and eosin staining were performed to detect pathological damage in the liver, and viral copy numbers and cytokine expression in the liver were evaluated by quantitative PCR. The CH strain (108.4 copiesmg) had higher viral titers than the CH60 strain (104.9 copiesmg) in the liver and caused ecchymotic hemorrhaging on the liver surface. Additionally, livers from ducklings inoculated with the CH strain were significantly infiltrated by numerous red blood cells, accompanied by severe cytokine storms, but similar signs were not observed in the livers of ducklings inoculated with the CH60 strain. In conclusion, the severe cytokine storm caused by the CH strain apparently induces hemorrhagic lesions in the liver, which might be a key factor in the rapid death of ducklings.",Jinyan Xie; Mingshu Wang;

The transcript levels of PsPAL, PsCHS, and PsDFR decreased while those of PsANS and PsUFGT were similar at 35 C compared with 20 C. The activities of the enzymes encoded by these genes were all increased in fruits at 35 C. The concentrations of anthocyanins were higher at 35 C on day 5 but then decreased to lower values on day 9 compared with that at 20 C. Furthermore, high temperature (35 C) increased the concentration of hydrogen peroxide and the activity of class III peroxidase in the fruit. The concentration of procatechuic acid, a product of the reaction between anthocyanin and hydrogen peroxide, hardly changed at 20 C but was significantly increased at 35 C on day 9, indicating that anthocyanin was degraded by hydrogen peroxide, which was catalyzed by class III peroxidase. Based on mathematical modeling, it was estimated that more than 6070% was enzymatically degraded on day 9 when the temperature increased from 20 C to 35 C.

c4225c99d7c4462991592f737dcb21cf,Wind loads and competition for light sculpt trees into selfsimilar structures,"Trees are selfsimilar structures: their branch lengths and diameters vary allometrically within the tree architecture, with longer and thicker branches near the ground. These tree allometries are often attributed to optimisation of hydraulic sap transport and safety against elastic buckling. Here, we show that these allometries also emerge from a model that includes competition for light, wind biomechanics and no hydraulics. We have developed MECHATREE, a numerical model of trees growing and evolving on a virtual island. With this model, we identify the fittest growth strategy when trees compete for light and allocate their photosynthates to grow seeds, create new branches or reinforce existing ones in response to windinduced loads. Strikingly, we find that selected trees species are selfsimilar and follow allometric scalings similar to those observed on dicots and conifers. This result suggests that resistance to wind and competition for light play an essential role in determining tree allometries. Tree branches follow allometric scalings between length, thickness and dry mass. Here, Eloy and colleagues develop a functionalstructural model that shows how such allometries in tree architecture can emerge through evolution as a result of competition for light, wind biomechanics, and wind sensing.",Christophe Eloy; Meriem Fournier; Andre Lacointe; Bruno Moulia,Computational models; Plant ecology; Plant evolution,"Aix Marseille Univ, CNRS, Marseille, France; LERFoB, INRA, AgroParisTech, Nancy, France; UCA, INRA, UMR PIAF, ClermontFerrand, France; UCA, INRA, UMR PIAF, ClermontFerrand, France"

Using our approach, we simultaneously excite and detect seven fluorophores expressed in distinct cellular and tissue compartments, plus second harmonics generation from collagen fibers in lymph nodes. This enables us to visualize the dynamic interplay of all the central cellular players during germinal center reactions. While current in vivo imaging typically enables recording the dynamics of 4 tissue components at a time, our strategy allows a more comprehensive analysis of cellular dynamics involving 8 singlelabeled compartments. It enables to investigate the orchestration of multiple cellular subsets determining tissue function, thus, opening the way for a mechanistic understanding of complex pathophysiologic processes in vivo.

The two apparent sources of metal cations are the contact surface and the wear debris, and the latter contains important 'historical' interface information but often is overlooked. We correlated the morphological and compositional characteristics of tribofilms and wear debris from an ILlubricated steelsteel contact. A complete multistep formation mechanism is proposed for the tribofilm of metalfree AW additives, including direct tribochemical reactions between the metallic contact surface with oxygen to form an oxide interlayer, wear debris generation and breakdown, tribofilm growth via mechanical deposition, chemical deposition, and oxygen diffusion.",Yan Zhou; Donovan N.

We analyzed longitudinal IFN, ELISAantibody and fecal shedding experimental sensitivity scores for MAP infection detection and disease progression. We used both statistical methods and dynamic mathematical models to (i) evaluate the empirical assays (ii) infer and explain biological mechanisms that affect the time evolution of the biomarkers, and (iii) predict disease stages of 57 animals that were naturally infected with MAP. This analysis confirms that the fecal test is the best marker for disease progression and illustrates that Th1Th2 (IFNELISA antibodies) assays are important for infection detection, but cannot reliably predict persistent infections. Our results show that the theoretical simulated macrophagebased assay is a potential good diagnostic marker for MAP persistent infections and predictor of disease specific stages. We therefore recommend specifically designed experiments to test the use of a based assay in the diagnosis of MAP infections.",Gesham Magombedze; Tinevimbo Shiri; Shigetoshi Eda; Judy R.

33d297cfb8a743d5bd9354431c0efac4,Persistence of fanshaped keratocytes is a matrixrigiditydependent mechanism that requires  5  1 integrin engagement,"Despite the importance of matrix rigidity on cell functions, many aspects of the mechanosensing process in highly migratory cells remain elusive. Here, we studied the migration of highly motile keratocytes on culture substrates with similar biochemical properties and rigidities spanning the range between soft tissues (~kPa) and stiff culture substrates (~GPa). We show that morphology, polarization and persistence of motile keratocytes are regulated by the matrix stiffness over seven orders of magnitude, without changing the cell spreading area. Increasing the matrix rigidity leads to more Factin in the lamellipodia and to the formation of mature contractile actomyosin fibers that control the cell rear retraction. Keratocytes remain rounded and form nascent adhesions on compliant substrates, whereas large and uniformly distributed focal adhesions are formed on fanshaped keratocytes migrating on rigid surfaces. By combining polyLlysine, fibronectin and vitronectin coatings with selective blocking of v3 or 51 integrins, we show that V3 integrins permit the spreading of keratocytes but are not sufficient for polarization and rigidity sensing that require the engagement of 51 integrins. Our study demonstrates a matrix rigiditydependent regulation of the directional persistence in motile keratocytes and refines the role of v3 and 51 integrins in the molecular clutch model.",Maryam Riaz; Marie Versaevel; Danahe Mohammed; Karine Glinel; Sylvain Gabriele,Cellular motility; Focal adhesion,"Mechanobiology  Soft Matter Group, Laboratoire Interfaces et Fluides Complexes, Centre d'Innovation et de Recherche en Materiaux Polymeres (CIRMAP), Research Institute for Biosciences, Universite de Mons, Mons, Belgium; Mechanobiology  Soft Matter Group, Laboratoire Interfaces et Fluides Complexes, Centre d'Innovation et de Recherche en Materiaux Polymeres (CIRMAP), Research Institute for Biosciences, Universite de Mons, Mons, Belgium; Mechanobiology  Soft Matter Group, Laboratoire Interfaces et Fluides Complexes, Centre d'Innovation et de Recherche en Materiaux Polymeres (CIRMAP), Research Institute for Biosciences, Universite de Mons, Mons, Belgium; Bio  Soft Matter division, Institute of Condensed Matter  Nanosciences, Universite Catholique de Louvain, Croix du Sud 1, box L7.04.02, B1348 LouvainlaNeuve, Belgium,

f3803eff9de748079cbef18ed59d08cd,Coupling and dynamics of cortical and autonomic signals are linked to central inhibition during the wakesleep transition,"Maintaining temporal coordination across physiological systems is crucial at the wakesleep transition. As shown in recent studies, the degree of coordination between brain and autonomic arousal influences attention, which highlights a previously unrecognised point of potential failure in the attention system. To investigate how cortical and autonomic dynamics are linked to the attentive process we analysed electroencephalogram, electrocardiogram and skin conductance data of 39 healthy adults recorded during a 2h restingstate oddball experiment. We related crosscorrelations to fluctuation periods of cortical and autonomic signals and correlated obtained measures to eventrelated potentials N1 and P2, reflecting excitatory and inhibitory processes. Increasing alignment of cortical and autonomic signals and longer periods of vigilance fluctuations corresponded to a larger and earlier P2; no such relations were found for N1. We compared two groups, with (I) and without measurable (II) delay in corticoautonomic correlations. Individuals in Group II had more stable vigilance fluctuations, larger and earlier P2 and fell asleep more frequently than individuals in Group I. Our results support the hypothesis of a link between corticoautonomic coupling and dynamics and central inhibition. Quantifying this link could help refine classification in psychiatric disorders with attention and sleeprelated symptoms, particularly in ADHD, depression, and insomnia.",Christine Ulke; Jue Huang; Justus T.

cc57423562e8425b99c6129972c6ddb8,Developmental seizures and mortality result from reducing GABA A receptor 2subunit interaction with collybistin,"Fast inhibitory synaptic transmission is mediated by aminobutyric acid type A receptors (GABAARs) that are enriched at functionally diverse synapses via mechanisms that remain unclear. Using isothermal titration calorimetry and complementary methods we demonstrate an exclusive low micromolar binding of collybistin to the 2subunit of GABAARs. To explore the biological relevance of collybistin2subunit selectivity, we generate mice with a mutation in the 2subunitcollybistin binding region (Gabra21). The mutation results in loss of a distinct subset of inhibitory synapses and decreased amplitude of inhibitory synaptic currents. Gabra21 mice have a striking phenotype characterized by increased susceptibility to seizures and early mortality. Surviving Gabra21 mice show anxiety and elevations in electroencephalogram  power, which are ameliorated by treatment with the 23selective positive modulator, AZD7325. Taken together, our results demonstrate an 2subunit selective binding of collybistin, which plays a key role in patterned brain activity, particularly during development. The inhibitory synaptic protein collybistin (CB) and GABAAR subunits are thought to interact, but strength and specificity are unclear. Here the authors study the CB2 interaction and show that a mouse mutated in the CBbinding region of 2 displays a loss of specific synapses and seizure.",Rochelle M.

c37d244726214cf491b8a69ff19ad385,"YAP and MRTFA, transcriptional coactivators of RhoAmediated gene expression, are critical for glioblastoma tumorigenicity","The role of YAP (Yesassociated protein 1) and MRTFA (myocardinrelated transcription factor A), two transcriptional coactivators regulated downstream of GPCRs (G proteincoupled receptors) and RhoA, in the growth of glioblastoma cells and in vivo glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) tumor development was explored using human glioblastoma cell lines and tumorinitiating cells derived from patientderived xenografts (PDX). Knockdown of these coactivators in GSC23 PDX cells using short hairpin RNA significantly attenuated in vitro selfrenewal capability assessed by limiting dilution, oncogene expression, and neurosphere formation. Orthotopic xenografts of the MRTFA and YAP knockdown PDX cells formed significantly smaller tumors and were of lower morbidity than wildtype cells. In vitro studies used PDX and 1321N1 glioblastoma cells to examine functional responses to sphingosine 1phosphate (S1P), a GPCR agonist that activates RhoA signaling, demonstrated that YAP signaling was required for cell migration and invasion, whereas MRTFA was required for cell adhesion; both YAP and MRTFA were required for proliferation. Gene expression analysis by RNAsequencing of S1Ptreated MRTFA or YAP knockout cells identified 44 genes that were induced through RhoA and highly dependent on YAP, MRTFA, or both. Knockdown of F3 (tissue factor (TF)), a target gene regulated selectively through YAP, blocked cell invasion and migration, whereas knockdown of HBEGF (heparinbinding epidermal growth factorlike growth factor), a gene selectively induced through MRTFA, prevented cell adhesion in response to S1P. Proliferation was sensitive to knockdown of target genes regulated through either or both YAP and MRTFA. Expression of TF and HBEGF was also selectively decreased in tumors from PDX cells lacking YAP or MRTFA, indicating that these transcriptional pathways are regulated in preclinical GBM models and suggesting that their activation through GPCRs and RhoA contributes to growth and maintenance of human GBM.",Olivia M.

In natura, hosts are often infected by multiple pathogens. However, most of the current studies have been performed under laboratory controlled conditions and by taking into account the interaction between a single commensal species and a single pathogenic species. The next step is therefore to explore the relationships between hostmicrobial communities (microbiota) and microbial members with potential pathogenic behavior (pathobiota) in a realistic ecological context. In the present study, we investigated such relationships within rootassociated and leafassociated bacterial communities of 163 ecologically contrasted Arabidopsis thaliana populations sampled across two seasons in southwest of France. In agreement with the theory of the invasion paradox, we observed a significant humpedback relationship between microbiota and pathobiota diversity that was robust between both seasons and plant organs. In most populations, we also observed a strong dynamics of microbiota composition between seasons. Accordingly, the potential pathobiota composition was explained by combinations of seasonspecific microbiota operational taxonomic units. This result suggests that the potential biomarkers controlling pathogen's invasion are highly dynamic.",Claudia Bartoli; Lea Frachon; Matthieu Barret; Mylene Rigal; Carine HuardChauveau; Baptiste Mayjonade; Catherine Zanchetta; Olivier Bouchez; Dominique Roby; Sebastien Carrere; Fabrice Roux,Metagenomics; Microbiome,"LIPM, INRA, CNRS, Universite de Toulouse, CastanetTolosan, France; LIPM, INRA, CNRS, Universite de Toulouse, CastanetTolosan, France; IRHS, INRA, AGROCAMPUSOuest, Universite d' Angers, SFR4207 QUASAV, Beaucouze, France; LIPM, INRA, CNRS, Universite de Toulouse, CastanetTolosan, France; LIPM, INRA, CNRS, Universite de Toulouse, CastanetTolosan, France; LIPM, INRA, CNRS, Universite de Toulouse, CastanetTolosan, France; INRA, GeTPlaGe, Genotoul, CastanetTolosan, France; INRA, GeTPlaGe, Genotoul, CastanetTolosan, France; LIPM, INRA, CNRS, Universite de Toulouse, CastanetTolosan, France; LIPM, INRA, CNRS, Universite de Toulouse, CastanetTolosan, France; LIPM, INRA, CNRS, Universite de Toulouse, CastanetTolosan, France"

However, inside the blood stream, nanocarriers' properties may change significantly due to interactions with proteins, aggregation, decomposition or premature loss of cargo. Thus, a method for precise, in situ characterization of drug nanocarriers in blood is needed. Here we show how the fluorescence correlation spectroscopy that is a wellestablished method for measuring the size, loading efficiency and stability of drug nanocarriers in aqueous solutions can be used to directly characterize drug nanocarriers in flowing blood. As the blood is not transparent for visible light and densely crowded with cells, we label the nanocarriers or their cargo with nearinfrared fluorescent dyes and fit the experimental autocorrelation functions with an analytical model accounting for the presence of blood cells. The developed methodology contributes towards quantitative understanding of the in vivo behavior of nanocarrierbased therapeutics. While nanocarrierbased drug delivery is a promising therapeutic approach, in situ characterization of drug nanocarriers in blood remains difficult.

Particularly, waterinoilinwater double emulsions provide significant advantages over simple oilinwater emulsions for microencapsulation, such as carrier of both aqueous and oily payloads and sustained release profile. However, double emulsions are thermodynamically unstable systems consisting typically of relatively large droplets. Here we show that nanoscale waterinoilinwater double emulsions can be prepared by adding a silica precursor polymer, hyperbranched polyethoxysiloxane, to the oil phase without any additional surfactants. The resulting double miniemulsions are transformed to robust waterSiO2polymerSiO2 nanocapsules via conversion of the precursor to silica and polymerization of the oil phase. Other intriguing nanostructures like nanorattles and Januslike nanomushrooms can also be obtained by changing preparation conditions. This simple surfactantfree double miniemulsion polymerization technique opens a promising avenue for mass production of various complex hybrid nanostructures that are amenable to numerous applications.

Osteogenic differentiation of MSCs is a cascade that recapitulates most, if not all, of the molecular events occurring during embryonic skeletal development, which is regulated by numerous signaling pathways including bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs). Through a comprehensive analysis of the osteogenic activity, we previously demonstrated that BMP9 is the most potent BMP for inducing bone formation from MSCs both in vitro and in vivo. However, as one of the least studied BMPs, the essential mediators of BMP9induced osteogenic signaling remain elusive. Here we show that BMP9induced osteogenic signaling in MSCs requires intact Notch signaling. While the expression of Notch receptors and ligands are readily detectable in MSCs, Notch inhibitor and dominantnegative Notch1 effectively inhibit BMP9induced osteogenic differentiation in vitro and ectopic bone formation in vivo. Genetic disruption of Notch pathway severely impairs BMP9induced osteogenic differentiation and ectopic bone formation from MSCs. Furthermore, while BMP9induced expression of earlyresponsive genes is not affected by defective Notch signaling, BMP9 upregulates the expression of Notch receptors and ligands at the intermediate stage of osteogenic differentiation. Taken together, these results demonstrate that Notch signaling may play an essential role in coordinating BMP9induced osteogenic differentiation of MSCs. Bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) 9 is a potent inducer of osteogenic differentiation from mesenchymal stem cells, but the mediators of BMP9induced osteogenesis remain elusive. Here, the authors show that inhibition of Notch1 signaling effectively diminishes BMP9induced osteogenesis. Genetic disruption of Notch pathway severely impairs BMP9induced bone formation. Thus, these results demonstrate that Notch signaling may play an essential role in coordinating osteogenic differentiation.",Jing Cui; Wenwen Zhang; Enyi Huang; Jia Wang; Junyi Liao; Ruidong Li; Xinyi Yu; Chen Zhao; Zongyue Zeng; Yi Shu; Ruyi Zhang; Shujuan Yan; Jiayan Lei; Chao Yang; Ke Wu; Ying Wu; Shifeng Huang; Xiaojuan Ji; Alexander Li; Cheng Gong; Chengfu Yuan; Linghuan Zhang; Wei Liu; Bo Huang; Yixiao Feng; Liping An; Bo Zhang; Zhengyu Dai; Yi Shen; Wenping Luo; Xi Wang; Ailong Huang; Hue H.

The sequence complexity and coevolutionary forces acting upon these effectors remain unknown. Here we generated a de novo transcriptome assembly representing the early life stages of SCN in both a compatible and an incompatible host interaction to facilitate global effector mining efforts in the absence of an available annotated SCN genome. We then employed a dual effector prediction strategy coupling a newly developed nematode effector prediction tool, NPreffector, with a traditional secreted protein prediction pipeline to uncover a suite of novel effector candidates. Our analysis distinguished between effectors that coevolve with the host genotype and those conserved by the pathogen to maintain a core function in parasitism and demonstrated that alternative splicing is one mechanism used to diversify the effector pool. In addition, we confirmed the presence of viral and microbial inhabitants with molecular sequence information.

a9ca36ad7a3d46139d47fd9639fa0110,Noncanonical activation of DAPK2 by AMPK constitutes a new pathway linking metabolic stress to autophagy,"Autophagy is an intracellular degradation process essential for adaptation to metabolic stress. DAPK2 is a calmodulinregulated protein kinase, which has been implicated in autophagy regulation, though the mechanism is unclear. Here, we show that the central metabolic sensor, AMPK, phosphorylates DAPK2 at a critical site in the protein structure, between the catalytic and the calmodulinbinding domains. This phosphorylation activates DAPK2 by functionally mimicking calmodulin binding and mitigating an inhibitory autophosphorylation, providing a novel, alternative mechanism for DAPK2 activation during metabolic stress. In addition, we show that DAPK2 phosphorylates the core autophagic machinery protein, Beclin1, leading to dissociation of its inhibitor, BclXL. Importantly, phosphorylation of DAPK2 by AMPK enhances DAPK2's ability to phosphorylate Beclin1, and depletion of DAPK2 reduces autophagy in response to AMPK activation. Our study reveals a unique calmodulinindependent mechanism for DAPK2 activation, critical to its function as a novel downstream effector of AMPK in autophagy. DAPK2 is a calmodulinregulated protein kinase implicated in autophagy regulation, but how physiological stress leads to its activation is yet unknown. Here, the authors show that the central metabolic sensor AMPK phosphorylates DAPK2 to promote autophagy in a calmodulinindependent mechanism.",Ruth Shiloh; Yuval Gilad; Yaara Ber; Miriam Eisenstein; Dina Aweida; Shani Bialik; Shenhav Cohen; Adi Kimchi,Kinases; Macroautophagy; Phosphoproteins; Phosphorylation; Stress signalling,"Department of Molecular Genetics, Weizmann Institute of Science, Rehovot, Israel; Department of Molecular Genetics, Weizmann Institute of Science, Rehovot, Israel; Department of Molecular Genetics, Weizmann Institute of Science, Rehovot, Israel; Department of Chemical Research Support, Weizmann Institute of Science, Rehovot, Israel; Faculty of Biology, Technion Israel Institute of Technology, Haifa, Israel; Department of Molecular Genetics, Weizmann Institute of Science, Rehovot, Israel; Faculty of Biology, Technion Israel Institute of Technology, Haifa, Israel; Department of Molecular Genetics, Weizmann Institute of Science, Rehovot, Israel"

Since the ECA is a critical input parameter for numerical simulations of diabatic processes, it is relevant to know the variation of the ECA with the fluid and wall temperatures. Several research groups have studied the effect of temperature on ECA either experimentally, with direct measures, or numerically, using molecular dynamic simulations. However, there is some disagreement between the authors. In this paper two possible theoretical models are presented, describing how the ECA varies with the surface temperature. These two models (called Decreasing Trend Model and Unsymmetrical Trend Model, respectively) are compared with experimental measurements. Within the experimental errors, the equilibrium contact angle shows a decrease with increasing surface temperatures on the hydrophilic surface. Conversely the ECA appears approximately constant on hydrophobic surfaces for increasing wall temperatures. The two conclusions for practical applications for weakly evaporating conditions are that (i) the higher the ECA, the smaller is the effect of the surface temperature, (ii) a good evaluation of the decrease of the ECA with the surface temperature can be obtained by the proposed DTM approach.",Fabio Villa; Marco Marengo; Joel De Coninck,Chemical physics; Imaging techniques; Surface chemistry,"University of Mons, Laboratory of Surface and Interfacial Physics (LPSI), Mons, Belgium; University of Brighton, School of Computing, Engineering and Mathematics, Brighton, UK; University of Mons, Laboratory of Surface and Interfacial Physics (LPSI), Mons, Belgium"

LAT1 forms a disulfidelinked heterodimer with CD98 heavy chain (CD98hc, 4F2hc or SLC3A2), but the mechanism of assembly and amino acid transport are poorly understood. Here we report the cryoEM structure of the human LAT1CD98hc heterodimer at 3.3A resolution. LAT1 features a canonical Leu Tfold and exhibits an unusual loop structure on transmembrane helix 6, creating an extended cavity that might accommodate bulky amino acids and drugs. CD98hc engages with LAT1 through the extracellular, transmembrane and putative cholesterolmediated interactions. We also show that two antiCD98 antibodies recognize distinct, multiple epitopes on CD98hc but not its glycans, explaining their robust reactivities. These results reveal the principles of glycoproteinsolute carrier assembly and provide templates for improving preclinical drugs and antibodies targeting LAT1 or CD98hc.

Particularly unusual states of matter can be created by light fields with strengths comparable to the Coulomb field that binds valence electrons in atoms, leading to nearly free electrons oscillating in the laser field and yet still loosely bound to the core1,2. These are known as KramersHenneberger states3, a specific example of laserdressed states2. Here, we demonstrate that these states arise not only in isolated atoms4,5, but also in rare gases, at and above atmospheric pressure, where they can act as a gain medium during laser filamentation. Using shaped laser pulses, gain in these states is achieved within just a few cycles of the guided field. The corresponding lasing emission is a signature of population inversion in these states and of their stability against ionization. Our work demonstrates that these unusual states of neutral atoms can be exploited to create a general ultrafast gain mechanism during laser filamentation. Light fields of energy comparable to the Coloumb field that binds valence electrons in atoms generate states where nearly free electrons oscillate in the laser field. These are now shown to exist in rare gases, acting as gain for laser filamentation.",Mary Matthews; Felipe Morales; Alexander Patas; Albrecht Lindinger; Julien Gateau; Nicolas Berti; Sylvain Hermelin; Jerome Kasparian; Maria Richter; Timm Bredtmann; Olga Smirnova; JeanPierre Wolf; Misha Ivanov,Atomic and molecular interactions with photons; Exotic atoms and molecules; Ultrafast photonics,"GAP, University of Geneva, Geneva, Switzerland; MaxBornInstitut fur Nichtlineare Optik und Kurzzeitspektroskopie, Berlin, Germany; Inst. fur Exp.

00e0e44efd4c437faaac15db679a9983,Genome plasticity is governed by double strand break DNA repair in Streptomyces,"The linear chromosome of the bacterium Streptomyces exhibits a remarkable genetic organization with grossly a central conserved region flanked by variable chromosomal arms. The terminal diversity colocates with an intense DNA plasticity including the occurrence of large deletions associated to circularization and chromosomal arm exchange. These observations prompted us to assess the role of double strand break (DSB) repair in chromosome plasticity following. For that purpose, DSBs were induced along the chromosome using the meganuclease ISceI. DSB repair in the central region of the chromosome was mutagenic at the healing site but kept intact the whole genome structure. In contrast, DSB repair in the chromosomal arms was mostly associated to the loss of the targeted chromosomal arm and extensive deletions beyond the cleavage sites. While homologous recombination occurring between copies of DNA sequences accounted for the most part of the chromosome rescue events, Non Homologous End Joining was involved in mutagenic repair as well as in huge genome rearrangements (i.e. circularization). Further, NHEJ repair was concomitant with the integration of genetic material at the healing site. We postulate that DSB repair drives genome plasticity and evolution in Streptomyces and that NHEJ may foster horizontal transfer in the environment.",Gregory Hoff; Claire Bertrand; Emilie Piotrowski; Annabelle Thibessard; Pierre Leblond,Bacterial genetics; Evolutionary genetics,"Universite de Lorraine, Institut National de la Recherche Agronomique, Dynamique des Genomes et Adaptation Microbienne (DynAMic), UMR INRA 1128, Nancy, France; Microbial Processes Interactions (MiPI), Gembloux AgroBio Tech, Bat.

23165019c37f4c1d9b15481cadeb092d,Dissociable cognitive strategies for sensorimotor learning,"Computations underlying cognitive strategies in human motor learning are poorly understood. Here we investigate such strategies in a common sensorimotor transformation task. We show that strategies assume two forms, likely reflecting distinct working memory representations: discrete caching of stimulusresponse contingencies, and timeconsuming parametric computations. Reaction times and errors suggest that both strategies are employed during learning, and trade off based on task complexity. Experiments using pressured preparation time further support dissociable strategies: In response caching, time pressure elicits multimodal distributions of movements; during parametric computations, time pressure elicits a shifting distribution of movements between visual targets and distal goals, consistent with analog recomputing of a movement plan. A generalization experiment reveals that discrete and parametric strategies produce, respectively, more localized or more global transfer effects. These results describe how qualitatively distinct cognitive representations are leveraged for motor learning and produce downstream consequences for behavioral flexibility. Motor learning is thought to be mostly procedural, but recent work has suggested that there is a strong cognitive component to it. Here, the authors show that humans use dissociable cognitive strategies, either caching successful responses or using a rulebased strategy, to solve a visuomotor learning task.",Samuel D.

Here, we show that Ormeloxifene (ORM), a selective estrogen receptor modulator approved for oral contraceptive use induces autophagic flux in ovarian cancer cells, which is activated by an ER stress response upstream of autophagy. The ER stress response is characterized by activation of IRE1, PERK and ATF6 and is under regulation of JNK. Pharmacological inhibition of either autophagy or ER stress increased cell survival, as did silencing of autophagy proteins LC3 and Beclin 1, implying that ORMinduced autophagy is prodeath in nature. Ultrastructural observations of treated cells confirmed stages of autophagic maturation. Caspasedependent apoptosis succeeded these events and was characterized by generation of reactive oxygen species and disruption of mitochondrial membrane potential. A concomitant inhibition of the AktmTOR axis was also observed with possible regulation of Akt by ORM. ORM inhibited tumor growth in ovarian xenograft model and displayed autophagic activity. In summary, in vitro and in vivo results reveal that ORM induces autophagyassociated cell death to attenuate proliferation of ovarian cancer cells.

We show that nanoceria forms stable and reversible bionanoconjugates with oligonucleotides and can specifically recognize and detect DNA sequences in a single step. In absence of the target DNA, the nanoprobe produced minimal background fluorescence due to the high quenching efficiency of nanoceria. Competitive binding of the target induced a concentration dependent increase in the fluorescence signal due to hybridization and release of the fluorescent tag from the nanoparticle surface. The nanoprobe enabled sensitive detection of the complementary strand with a detection limit of 0.12 nM, using a single step procedure.

For patients with relapsedrefractory AML, the prognosis is particularly poor with currently available treatments. Although genetically heterogeneous, AML subtypes share a common differentiation arrest at hematopoietic progenitor stages. Overcoming this differentiation arrest has the potential to improve the longterm survival of patients, as is the case in acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL), which is characterized by a chromosomal translocation involving the retinoic acid receptor alpha gene. Treatment of APL with alltrans retinoic acid (ATRA) induces terminal differentiation and apoptosis of leukemic promyelocytes, resulting in cure rates of over 80%. Unfortunately, similarly efficacious differentiation therapies have, to date, been lacking outside of APL.

Many COPD patients got readmitted to hospital within 30 days after discharge due to various reasons. Such readmission can usually be avoided if additional attention is paid to patients with high readmission risk and appropriate actions are taken. This makes early prediction of the hospital readmission risk an important problem. The goal of this paper is to conduct a systematic study on developing different types of machine learning models, including both deep and nondeep ones, for predicting the readmission risk of COPD patients. We evaluate those different approaches on a real world database containing the medical claims of 111,992 patients from the Geisinger Health System from January 2004 to September 2015. The patient features we build the machine learning models upon include both knowledgedriven ones, which are the features extracted according to clinical knowledge potentially related to COPD readmission, and datadriven features, which are extracted from the patient data themselves. Our analysis showed that the prediction performance in terms of Area Under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) Curve (AUC) can be improved from around 0.60 using knowledgedriven features, to 0.653 by combining both knowledgedriven and datadriven features, based on the oneyear claims history before discharge.

fe6fab08f26a47f2b6ae8ec2cc38172b,Inbeam measurement of the hydrogen hyperfine splitting and prospects for antihydrogen spectroscopy,"Antihydrogen, the lightest atom consisting purely of antimatter, is an ideal laboratory to study the CPT symmetry by comparison with hydrogen. With respect to absolute precision, transitions within the groundstate hyperfine structure (GSHFS) are most appealing by virtue of their small energy separation. ASACUSA proposed employing a beam of cold antihydrogen atoms in a Rabitype experiment, to determine the GSHFS in a fieldfree region. Here we present a measurement of the zerofield hydrogen GSHFS using the spectroscopy apparatus of ASACUSA's antihydrogen experiment. The measured value of HF1,420,405,748.4(3.4) (1.6) Hz with a relative precision of 2.7  109 constitutes the most precise determination of this quantity in a beam and verifies the developed spectroscopy methods for the antihydrogen HFS experiment to the p.p.b. level. Together with the recently presented observation of antihydrogen atoms 2.7 m downstream of the production region, the prerequisites for a measurement with antihydrogen are now available within the ASACUSA collaboration. Comparing the groundstate hyperfine structure of antihydrogen to that of hydrogen will provide insights into CPT symmetry in nature. Here the authors report the most precise inbeam measurement of this quantity for hydrogen to demonstrate the viability of ASACUSA's setup to measure it in antihydrogen.",M. Diermaier; C. B.

dac550e6fd544b6483be2619652f15fa,Structural basis of cotranslational quality control by ArfA and RF2 bound to ribosome,"The structure of the bacterial ribosome in complex with the ArfA and the release factor RF2 shows how ArfA recruits RF2 to terminate translation of messenger RNAs that lack a stop codon in the ribosome. When ribosomes stall on messenger RNAs, translation must be terminated so that the ribosome can be recycled. One trigger for stalling is the lack of a stop codon. Bacteria have multiple rescue systems, one of which uses the ArfA protein. The groups of Daniel Wilson, Ning Gao and Hong Jin have independently solved the structure of the bacterial ribosome in complex with ArfA, the release factor RF2, an mRNA that mimics the nonstop situation, and, in the Gao work, a Psite transfer RNA. They find that the C terminus of ArfA occupies the mRNA entry channel, while the N terminus recruits RF2 and stabilizes an active conformation in the release factor, even in the absence of a stop codon. Quality control mechanisms intervene appropriately when defective translation events occur, in order to preserve the integrity of protein synthesis. Rescue of ribosomes translating on messenger RNAs that lack stop codons is one of the cotranslational quality control pathways. In many bacteria, ArfA recognizes stalled ribosomes and recruits the release factor RF2, which catalyses the termination of protein synthesis1,2,3. Although an inducedfit mechanism of nonstop mRNA surveillance mediated by ArfA and RF2 has been reported4, the molecular interaction between ArfA and RF2 in the ribosome that is responsible for the mechanism is unknown. Here we report an electron cryomicroscopy structure of ArfA and RF2 in complex with the 70S ribosome bound to a nonstop mRNA. The structure, which is consistent with our kinetic and biochemical data, reveals the molecular interactions that enable ArfA to specifically recruit RF2, not RF1, into the ribosome and to enable RF2 to release the truncated protein product in this cotranslational quality control pathway. The positively charged Cterminal domain of ArfA anchors in the mRNA entry channel of the ribosome. Furthermore, binding of ArfA and RF2 induces conformational changes in the ribosomal decoding centre that are similar to those seen in other proteininvolved decoding processes. Specific interactions between residues in the Nterminal domain of ArfA and RF2 help RF2 to adopt a catalytically competent conformation for peptide release. Our findings provide a framework for understanding recognition of the translational state of the ribosome by new proteins, and expand our knowledge of the decoding potential of the ribosome.",Fuxing Zeng; Yanbo Chen; Jonathan Remis; Mrinal Shekhar; James C.

The current frontier is the integration of models expressed in different formalisms to address the multiscale biological system organization challenge. We present MUFINS (MUltiFormalism Interaction Network Simulator) software, implementing a unique set of approaches for multiformalism simulation of interaction networks. We extend the constraintbased modeling (CBM) framework by incorporation of linear inhibition constraints, enabling for the first time linear modeling of networks simultaneously describing gene regulation, signaling and wholecell metabolism at steady state. We present a use case where a logical hypergraph model of a regulatory network is expressed by linear constraints and integrated with a GenomeScale Metabolic Network (GSMN) of mouse macrophage. We experimentally validate predictions, demonstrating application of our software in an iterative cycle of hypothesis generation, validation and model refinement. MUFINS incorporates an extended version of our QuasiSteady State Petri Net approach to integrate dynamic models with CBM, which we demonstrate through a dynamic model of cortisol signaling integrated with the human Recon2 GSMN and a model of nutrient dynamics in physiological compartments. Finally, we implement a number of methods for deriving metabolic states from ~omics data, including our new variant of the iMAT congruency approach. We compare our approach with iMAT through the analysis of 262 individual tumor transcriptomes, recovering features of metabolic reprogramming in cancer.

Here, we demonstrated the capability of the small molecule N(1,3benzodioxol5yl)25chloro2methoxy(phenylsulfonyl)anilino]acetamide (LX2343) to ameliorate the cognitive dysfunction of AD model rats by inhibiting OSinduced neuronal apoptosis and tauopathy. Streptozotocin (STZ) was used to induce OS in neuronal cells in vitro and in AD model rats that were made by intracerebroventricular injection of STZ (3 mgkg, bilaterally), and Morris water maze test was used to evaluate the cognitive dysfunction in ICVSTZ rats. Treatment with LX2343 (520 molL) significantly attenuated STZinduced apoptosis in SHSY5Y cells and mouse primary cortical neurons by alleviating OS and inhibiting the JNKp38 and proapoptotic pathways. LX2343 was able to restore the integrity of mitochondrial function and morphology, increase ATP biosynthesis, and reduce ROS accumulation in the neuronal cells. In addition, LX2343 was found to be a nonATP competitive GSK3 inhibitor with IC50 of 1.840.07 molL, and it potently inhibited tau hyperphosphorylation in the neuronal cells. In ICVSTZ rats, administration of LX2343 (7, 21 mgkg1d1, ip, for 5 weeks) efficiently improved their cognitive deficits. LX2343 ameliorates the cognitive dysfunction in the AD model rats by suppressing OSinduced neuronal apoptosis and tauopathy, thus highlighting the potential of LX2343 for the treatment of AD.",Xiaodan Guo; Guanglong Sun; Tingting Zhou; Yiyang Wang; Xin Xu; Xiaofan Shi; Zhiyuan Zhu; Vatcharin Rukachaisirikul; Lihong Hu; Xu Shen,"Biomedicine, general; PharmacologyToxicology; Medical Microbiology; Immunology; Internal Medicine; Vaccine","CAS Key Laboratory of Receptor Research, Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai, China; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China; CAS Key Laboratory of Receptor Research, Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai, China; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China; CAS Key Laboratory of Receptor Research, Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai, China; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China; CAS Key Laboratory of Receptor Research, Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai, China; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China; CAS Key Laboratory of Receptor Research, Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai, China; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China; CAS Key Laboratory of Receptor Research, Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai, China; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China; CAS Key Laboratory of Receptor Research, Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai, China; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China; Department of Chemistry, Faculty of Science, Prince of Songkla University, Hat Yai, Songkhla, Thailand; CAS Key Laboratory of Receptor Research, Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai, China; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China; CAS Key Laboratory of Receptor Research, Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai, China; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China"

A skyrmionium is a more promising spin texture for memory applications, since it has zero total topological charge and propagates strictly along a nanotrack. Here, the stability of the skyrmionium, as well as the dependence of its size on the magnetic parameters, such as the DzyaloshinskiiMoriya interaction and perpendicular magnetic anisotropy, are studied by means of micromagnetic simulations. We propose an advanced method for the skyrmionium nucleation due to a local enhancement of the spin Hall effect.

Braiding Majorana zero modes forms the basis of topologically protected quantum operations which could, in principle, significantly reduce qubit decoherence and gate control errors at the device level. Therefore, searching for Majorana zero modes in various solid state systems is a major topic in condensed matter physics and quantum computer science. Since the first experimental signature observed in hybrid superconductorsemiconductor nanowire devices, this field has witnessed a dramatic expansion in material science, transport experiments and theory. While making the first topological qubit based on these Majorana nanowires is currently an ongoing effort, several related important transport experiments are still being pursued in the near term. These will not only serve as intermediate steps but also show Majorana physics in a more fundamental aspect. In this perspective, we summarize these key Majorana experiments and the potential challenges. The pursuit of topological qubits based on Majorana zero mode within nanowires is highly desired.

We summarize ways that immunosuppression and immunoenhancement are defined and explain how specific outcomes are used to evaluate immunotoxicity in humans and experimental animals. We observe that different approaches to defining immunotoxicological outcomes, particularly those that do not produce clinical disease, may lead to different conclusions from epidemiological and toxicological studies. The fundamental point that we make is that aspects of epidemiological studies considered as limitations can be minimized when data from toxicological studies support epidemiological findings. Taken together, we find that results of epidemiological studies, supported by findings from toxicological studies, provide strong evidence that humans exposed to PFOA and PFOS are at risk for immunosuppression.",Jamie C.

A targetdirected miRNA degradation mechanism (TDMD) has been suggested, but further investigation on endogenous targets is necessary. Here, we identify hundreds of targets eligible for TDMD and show that an endogenous RNA (Serpine1) controls the degradation of two miRNAs (miR30b5p and miR30c5p) in mouse fibroblasts. In our study, TDMD occurs when the target is expressed at relatively low levels, similar in range to those of its miRNAs (100200 copies per cell), and becomes more effective at high target:miRNA ratios (10:1). We employ CRISPRCas9 to delete the miR30 responsive element within Serpine1 3'UTR and interfere with TDMD. TDMD suppression increases miR30bc levels and boosts their activity towards other targets, modulating gene expression and cellular phenotypes (i.e., cell cycle reentry and apoptosis). In conclusion, a sophisticated regulatory layer of miRNA and gene expression mediated by specific endogenous targets exists in mammalian cells. Via the targetdirected miRNA degradation process, RNAs can induce degradation of miRNAs by binding with extensive complementarity. Here, the authors show Serpine1 mRNA as one such RNA that can control the levels of the endogenous miRNA miR30bc5p by modulating miRNA degradation.",Francesco Ghini; Carmela Rubolino; Montserrat Climent; Ines Simeone; Matteo J.

Here we show that the glycolytic enzyme pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2) limits glucose oxidation, and maintains the growth and epigenetic state of ECs. We find that loss of PKM2 alters mitochondrial substrate utilization and impairs EC proliferation and migration in vivo. Mechanistically, we show that the NFB transcription factor RELB is responsive to PKM2 loss, limiting EC growth through the regulation of P53. Furthermore, Sadenosylmethionine synthesis is impaired in the absence of PKM2, resulting in DNA hypomethylation, derepression of endogenous retroviral elements (ERVs) and activation of antiviral innate immune signalling. This work reveals the metabolic and functional consequences of glucose oxidation in the endothelium, highlights the importance of PKM2 for endothelial growth and links metabolic dysfunction with autoimmune activation in ECs. The glycolytic enzyme pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2) is required for nucleotide synthesis and cell proliferation.

In this work, we investigate the charge of solvated protons at the Pt(111) | H2O and Al(111) | H2O interfaces. Using semilocal densityfunctional theory as well as hybrid functionals and embedded correlated wavefunction methods as higherlevel benchmarks, we show that the effective charge of a solvated proton in the electrochemical double layer or outer Helmholtz plane at all levels of theory is fractional, when the solvated proton and solvent band edges are aligned correctly with the Fermi level of the metal (EF). The observed fractional charge in the absence of frontier band misalignment arises from a significant overlap between the proton and the electron density from the metal surface, and results in an energetic difference between protons in bulk solution and those in the outer Helmholtz plane.

Here we show that LbCpf1 can be used for therapeutic gene editing in a mouse model of agerelated macular degeneration (AMD). The intravitreal delivery of LbCpf1, targeted to two angiogenesisassociated genes encoding vascular endothelial growth factor A (Vegfa) and hypoxia inducing factor 1a (Hif1a), using adenoassociated virus, led to efficient gene disruption with no apparent offtarget effects in the retina and retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) cells. Importantly, LbCpf1 targeted to Vegfa or Hif1a in RPE cells reduced the area of laserinduced choroidal neovascularization as efficiently as aflibercept, an antiVEGF drug currently used in the clinic, without inducing cone dysfunction. Unlike aflibercept, LbCpf1 targeted to Vegfa or Hif1a achieved a longterm therapeutic effect on CNV, potentially avoiding repetitive injections. Taken together, these results indicate that LbCpf1mediated in vivo genome editing to ablate pathologic angiogenesis provides an effective strategy for the treatment of AMD and other neovascularizationassociated diseases. The CRISPR endonuclease LbCpf1 is reported to have greater efficiency and specificity than Cas9. Here, the authors use LbCpf1 to target the angiogenesisrelated genes VEGF and HIF1a, and show that delivery of the nuclease using AAV9 is effective in mouse models of macular degeneration.",Taeyoung Koo; Sung Wook Park; Dong Hyun Jo; Daesik Kim; Jin Hyoung Kim; HeeYeon Cho; Jeungeun Kim; Jeong Hun Kim; JinSoo Kim,Gene therapy; Macular degeneration,"Center for Genome Engineering, Institute for Basic Science, Seoul, Republic of Korea; Department of Basic Science, University of Science and Technology, Daejeon, Republic of Korea; FARB Laboratory, Biomedical Research Institute, Seoul National University Hospital, Seoul, Republic of Korea; Department of Biomedical Sciences, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul, Republic of Korea; Department of Ophthalmology, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul, Republic of Korea; FARB Laboratory, Biomedical Research Institute, Seoul National University Hospital, Seoul, Republic of Korea; Department of Chemistry, Seoul National University, Seoul, South Korea; FARB Laboratory, Biomedical Research Institute, Seoul National University Hospital, Seoul, Republic of Korea; Center for Genome Engineering, Institute for Basic Science, Seoul, Republic of Korea; Department of Chemistry, Seoul National University, Seoul, South Korea; FARB Laboratory, Biomedical Research Institute, Seoul National University Hospital, Seoul, Republic of Korea; Department of Biomedical Sciences, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul, Republic of Korea; Department of Ophthalmology, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul, Republic of Korea; Center for Genome Engineering, Institute for Basic Science, Seoul, Republic of Korea; Department of Basic Science, University of Science and Technology, Daejeon, Republic of Korea; Department of Chemistry, Seoul National University, Seoul, South Korea"

To date, oceanacidification studies with fish larvae have focused on the direct physiological impacts of elevated CO2, but largely ignored the potential effects of ocean acidification on food web interactions. In an in situ mesocosm study on Atlantic herring (Clupea harengus) larvae as top predators in a pelagic food web, we account for indirect CO2 effects on larval survival mediated by changes in food availability. The community was exposed to projected endofthecentury CO2 conditions (~760 atm pCO2) over a period of 113 days. In contrast with laboratory studies that reported a decrease in fish survival, the survival of the herring larvae in situ was significantly enhanced by 19  2%. Analysis of the plankton community dynamics suggested that the herring larvae benefitted from a CO2stimulated increase in primary production. Such indirect effects may counteract the possible direct negative effects of ocean acidification on the survival of fish early life stages. These findings emphasize the need to assess the food web effects of ocean acidification on fish larvae before we can predict even the sign of change in fish recruitment in a highCO2 ocean. An in situ mesocosm experiment finds enhanced survival of Atlantic herring larvae under projected endofcentury oceanacidification conditions, which probably results from higher primary production in higher CO2 levels.",Michael Sswat; Martina H.

However, the role of EBV in NKTCL development is unclear, largely due to the lack of information about EBV genome and transcriptome in NKTCL. Here, using highthroughput sequencing, we obtained whole genome (n  27) and transcriptome datasets (n  18) of EBV derived from NKTCL tumor biopsies. We assembled 27 EBV genomes and detected an average of 1,152 single nucleotide variants and 44.8 indels (50 bp) of EBV per sample. We also identified frequent focal EBV genome deletions and integrated EBV fragments in the host genome. Moreover, Phylogenetic analysis revealed that NKTCLderived EBVs are closely clustered; transcriptome analysis revealed less activation of both latent and lytic genes and larger amount of Tcell epitope alterations in NKTCL, as compared with other EBVassociated cancers. Furthermore, we observed transcriptional defects of the BARTs miRNA by deletion, and the disruption of host NHEJ1 by integrated EBV fragment, implying novel pathogenic mechanisms of EBV. Taken together, we reported for the first time global mutational and transcriptional profiles of EBV in NKTCL clinical samples, revealing important somatic events of EBV and providing insights to better understanding of EBV's contribution in tumorigenesis.",RouJun Peng; BoWei Han; QingQing Cai; XiaoYu Zuo; Tao Xia; JieRong Chen; LiNa Feng; Jing Quan Lim; ShuWei Chen; MuSheng Zeng; YunMiao Guo; Bo Li; XiaoJun Xia; Yi Xia; Yurike Laurensia; Burton Kuan Hui Chia; HuiQiang Huang; Ken He Young; Soon Thye Lim; Choon Kiat Ong; YiXin Zeng; JinXin Bei,Cancer genomics; Tumour virus infections,"Sun YatSen University Cancer Center, State Key Laboratory of Oncology in South China, Collaborative Innovation Center for Cancer Medicine, Guangzhou, China; Sun YatSen University Cancer Center, State Key Laboratory of Oncology in South China, Collaborative Innovation Center for Cancer Medicine, Guangzhou, China; Sun YatSen University Cancer Center, State Key Laboratory of Oncology in South China, Collaborative Innovation Center for Cancer Medicine, Guangzhou, China; Sun YatSen University Cancer Center, State Key Laboratory of Oncology in South China, Collaborative Innovation Center for Cancer Medicine, Guangzhou, China; Sun YatSen University Cancer Center, State Key Laboratory of Oncology in South China, Collaborative Innovation Center for Cancer Medicine, Guangzhou, China; Sun YatSen University Cancer Center, State Key Laboratory of Oncology in South China, Collaborative Innovation Center for Cancer Medicine, Guangzhou, China; Sun YatSen University Cancer Center, State Key Laboratory of Oncology in South China, Collaborative Innovation Center for Cancer Medicine, Guangzhou, China; Department of Oncology, Affiliated Hospital of Jining Medical University, Jining, China; Division of Cellular and Molecular Research, National Cancer Centre Singapore, Singapore, Singapore; Sun YatSen University Cancer Center, State Key Laboratory of Oncology in South China, Collaborative Innovation Center for Cancer Medicine, Guangzhou, China; Sun YatSen University Cancer Center, State Key Laboratory of Oncology in South China, Collaborative Innovation Center for Cancer Medicine, Guangzhou, China; Sun YatSen University Cancer Center, State Key Laboratory of Oncology in South China, Collaborative Innovation Center for Cancer Medicine, Guangzhou, China; Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Zhongshan School of Medicine, Sun YatSen University, Guangzhou, China; RNA Biomedical Institute, Sun YatSen Memorial Hospital, Sun YatSen University, Guangzhou, China; Sun YatSen University Cancer Center, State Key Laboratory of Oncology in South China, Collaborative Innovation Center for Cancer Medicine, Guangzhou, China; Sun YatSen University Cancer Center, State Key Laboratory of Oncology in South China, Collaborative Innovation Center for Cancer Medicine, Guangzhou, China; Division of Cellular and Molecular Research, National Cancer Centre Singapore, Singapore, Singapore; Division of Cellular and Molecular Research, National Cancer Centre Singapore, Singapore, Singapore; Sun YatSen University Cancer Center, State Key Laboratory of Oncology in South China, Collaborative Innovation Center for Cancer Medicine, Guangzhou, China; Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, USA; Division of Medical Oncology, National Cancer Center Singapore, Singapore, Singapore; SingHealth DukeNUS Blood Cancer Centre, Singapore, Singapore; DukeNUS Medical School, Singapore, Singapore; Division of Cellular and Molecular Research, National Cancer Centre Singapore, Singapore, Singapore; Genome Institute of Singapore, ASTAR, Singapore, Singapore; DukeNUS Medical School, Singapore, Singapore; Sun YatSen University Cancer Center, State Key Laboratory of Oncology in South China, Collaborative Innovation Center for Cancer Medicine, Guangzhou, China; Sun YatSen University Cancer Center, State Key Laboratory of Oncology in South China, Collaborative Innovation Center for Cancer Medicine, Guangzhou, China; Center for Precision Medicine, Sun YatSen University, Guangzhou, China"
10e7403cd58141b58c28429b3d3df33a,Novel therapeutic strategy for cervical cancer harboring FGFR3TACC3 fusions,"We previously found that therapeutic targetable fusions are detected across various cancers. To identify therapeutic targetable fusion in uterine cervical cancer, for which no effective gene targeted therapy has yet been clinically applied, we analyzed RNA sequencing data from 306 cervical cancer samples. We detected 445 high confidence fusion transcripts and identified four samples that harbored FGFR3TACC3 fusion as an attractive therapeutic target. The frequency of FGFR3TACC3fusionpositive cervical cancer is also 1.9% (2103) in an independent cohort. Continuous expression of the FGFR3TACC3 fusion transcript and protein induced anchorageindependent growth in the cervical epithelial cell line established from the ectocervix (Ect1E6E7) but not in that from endocervix (End1E6E7). Injection of FGFR3TACC3 fusiontransfectedEct1E6E7 cells subcutaneously into NOG mice generated squamous cell carcinoma xenograft tumors, suggesting the association between FGFR3TACC3 fusion and squamous cell carcinogenesis. Transfection of a FGFR3TACC3 fusion transcript into four cervical cancer cell lines (SiHa, ME180, HeLa, and Ca Ski) induced activation of the MAPK pathway and enhancement of cell proliferation. Transcriptome analysis of the FGFR3TACC3 fusiontransfected cell lines revealed that an IL8triggered inflammatory response was increased, via activation of FGFR3MAPK signaling. Continuous expression of FGFR3TACC3 fusion led to activation of the PI3KAKT pathway only in the two cell lines that harbored PIK3CA mutations. Sensitivity to the FGFR inhibitor, BGJ398, was found to depend on PIK3CA mutation status. Dual inhibition of both FGFR and AKT showed an obvious synergistic effect in cell lines that harbor mutant PIK3CA. Additionally, TACC3 inhibitor, KHS101, suppressed FGFR3TACC3 fusion protein expression and showed antitumor effect against FGFR3TACC3 fusiontransfected cell lines. FGFR3TACC3 fusionpositive cancer has frequent genetic alterations of the PI3KAKT pathway and selection of appropriate treatment based on PI3KAKT pathway status should be required.",Ryo Tamura; Kosuke Yoshihara; Tetsuya Saito; Ryosuke Ishimura; Juan Emmanuel MartinezLedesma; Hu Xin; Tatsuya Ishiguro; Yutaro Mori; Kaoru Yamawaki; Kazuaki Suda; Seiya Sato; Hiroaki Itamochi; Teiichi Motoyama; Yoichi Aoki; Shujiro Okuda; Cristine R.

30ba6801502d4152b1128ca0f78f7aaf,Aspirin inhibits the proliferation of hepatoma cells through controlling GLUT1mediated glucose metabolism,"Aspirin can efficiently inhibit liver cancer growth, but the mechanism is poorly understood. In this study, we report that aspirin modulates glucose uptake through downregulating glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1), leading to the inhibition of hepatoma cell proliferation. Our data showed that aspirin significantly decreased the levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and glucose consumption in hepatoma cells. Interestingly, we identified that GLUT1 and HIF1 could be decreased by aspirin. Mechanically, we demonstrated that the 1008780 region was the regulatory element of transcriptional factor NFB in GLUT1 promoter by luciferase report gene assays. PDTC, an inhibitor of NFB, could suppress the expression of GLUT1 in HepG2 and H7402 cells, followed by affecting the levels of ROS and glucose consumption. CoCl2activated HIF1 expression could slightly rescue the GLUT1 expression inhibited by aspirin or PDTC, suggesting that aspirin depressed GLUT1 through targeting NFB or NFBHIF1 signaling. Moreover, we found that GLUT1 was highly expressed in clinical HCC tissues relating to their paired adjacent normal tissues. Importantly, we observed that high level of GLUT1 was significantly correlated with the poor relapsefree survival of HCC patients by analysis of public data. Functionally, overexpression of GLUT1 blocked the PDTCinduced or aspirininduced inhibition of glucose metabolism in HepG2 cells. Conversely, aspirin failed to work when GLUT1 was stably knocked down in the cells. Administration of aspirin could depress the growth of hepatoma cells through controlling GLUT1 in vitro and in vivo. Thus, our finding provides new insights into the mechanism by which aspirin depresses liver cancer.",Yunxia Liu; Jinyan Feng; Mingming Sun; Bowen Liu; Guang Yang; Yanan Bu; Man Zhao; Tianjiao Wang; Weiying Zhang; Hongfeng Yuan; Xiaodong Zhang,"Biomedicine, general; PharmacologyToxicology; Medical Microbiology; Immunology; Internal Medicine; Vaccine","Department of Cancer Research, College of Life Sciences, Nankai University, Tianjin, China; Department of Cancer Research, College of Life Sciences, Nankai University, Tianjin, China; Department of Cancer Research, College of Life Sciences, Nankai University, Tianjin, China; Department of Biochemistry, College of Life Sciences, Nankai University, Tianjin, China; Department of Cancer Research, College of Life Sciences, Nankai University, Tianjin, China; Department of Cancer Research, College of Life Sciences, Nankai University, Tianjin, China; Department of Cancer Research, College of Life Sciences, Nankai University, Tianjin, China; Department of Biochemistry, College of Life Sciences, Nankai University, Tianjin, China; Department of Cancer Research, College of Life Sciences, Nankai University, Tianjin, China; Department of Cancer Research, College of Life Sciences, Nankai University, Tianjin, China; Department of Cancer Research, College of Life Sciences, Nankai University, Tianjin, China"

c9e5ce1ae43d4bedb78eb01b9a591af5, Opioid Receptor Activation in Dopamine Neurons Disrupts Behavioral Inhibition,"The dynorphinopioid receptor (KOR) system has been previously implicated in the regulation of cognition, but the neural circuitry and molecular mechanisms underlying KORmediated cognitive disruption are unknown. Here, we used an operational test of cognition involving timing and behavioral inhibition and found that systemic KOR activation impairs performance of male and female C57BL6 mice in the differential reinforcement of low response rate (DRL) task. Systemic KOR antagonism also blocked stressinduced disruptions of DRL performance. KOR activation increased 'bursts' of incorrect responses in the DRL task and increased marble burying, suggesting that the observed disruptions in DRL performance may be attributed to KORinduced increases in compulsive behavior. Local inactivation of KOR by injection of the longacting antagonist norBNI in the ventral tegmental area (VTA), but not the infralimbic prefrontal cortex (PFC) or dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN), prevented disruption of DRL performance caused by systemic KOR activation. Credependent genetic excision of KOR from dopaminergic, but not serotonergic neurons, also blocked KORmediated disruption of DRL performance. At the molecular level, we found that these disruptive effects did not require arrestindependent signaling, because neither global deletion of Gprotein receptor kinase 3 (GRK3) nor cellspecific deletion of GRK3arrestindependent p38 MAPK from dopamine neurons blocked KORmediated DRL disruptions. We then showed that nalfurafine, a clinically available Gbiased KOR agonist, could also produce DRL disruptions. Together, these studies demonstrate that KOR activation in VTA dopamine neurons disrupts behavioral inhibition in a GRK3arrestinindependent manner and suggests that KOR antagonists could be beneficial for decreasing stressinduced compulsive behaviors.",Antony D Abraham; Harrison M Fontaine; Allisa J Song; Mackenzie M Andrews; Madison A Baird; Brigitte L Kieffer; Benjamin B Land; Charles Chavkin,Cell signalling; Cognitive neuroscience; Membrane proteins; Molecular neuroscience; Psychology,"Department of Pharmacology, University of Washington School of Medicine, Seattle, USA; Department of Pharmacology, University of Washington School of Medicine, Seattle, USA; Department of Pharmacology, University of Washington School of Medicine, Seattle, USA; Department of Pharmacology, University of Washington School of Medicine, Seattle, USA; Department of Pharmacology, University of Washington School of Medicine, Seattle, USA; Department of Psychiatry, Research Center of the Douglas Mental Health University Institute, McGill University, Montreal, Quebec, Canada,

The disease is usually characterized by a benign or slowly progressive, congenital or early onset muscle weakness and atrophy that mainly affects the lower extremities, although some affected individuals show involvement of the arms and the shoulder girdle. Here we report unusual extremes of BICD2related diseases: A severe form of congenital muscular atrophy with arthrogryposis multiplex, respiratory insufficiency and lethality within four months. This was caused by three BICD2 variants, (c.581AG, p.(Gln194Arg)), (c.1626CG, p.(Cys542Trp)) and (c.2080CT, p.(Arg694Cys)), two of which were proven to be de novo. Affected individuals showed reduced fetal movement, weak muscle tone and sparse or no spontaneous activity after birth. Despite assisted ventilation, the condition led to early death. At the other extreme, we identified an asymptomatic woman with a known BICD2 variant (c.2108CT, p.(Thr703Met)). Radiological examination showed fatty degeneration of selected thigh and calf muscles without clinical consequences. Instead, her son carrying the same variant is affected by a mild childhood onset disease with myopathic and neurogenic features. Mechanisms leading to variable expressivity and onset of BICD2related disease may include alterations in molecular interactions of BICD2 and suggest the presence of genetic modifiers that may act in a protective fashion to ameliorate or abrogate disease.

4295c9817b5a4268ace18fa9f9add9b8,Deep phenotyping unveils hidden traits and genetic relations in subtle mutants,"Discovering mechanistic insights from phenotypic information is critical for the understanding of biological processes. For model organisms, unlike in cell culture, this is currently bottlenecked by the nonquantitative nature and perceptive biases of human observations, and the limited number of reporters that can be simultaneously incorporated in live animals. An additional challenge is that isogenic populations exhibit significant phenotypic heterogeneity. These difficulties limit genetic approaches to many biological questions. To overcome these bottlenecks, we developed tools to extract complex phenotypic traits from images of fluorescently labelled subcellular landmarks, using C. elegans synapses as a test case. By populationwide comparisons, we identified subtle but relevant differences inaccessible to subjective conceptualization. Furthermore, the models generated testable hypotheses of how individual alleles relate to known mechanisms or belong to new pathways. We show that our model not only recapitulates current knowledge in synaptic patterning but also identifies novel alleles overlooked by traditional methods. Experimenter scoring of cellular imaging data can be biased. This study describes an automated and unbiased multidimensional phenotyping method that relies on machine learning and complex feature computation of imaging data, and identifies weak alleles affecting synapse morphology in live C. elegans.

                 Multipass membrane proteins perform critical signal transduction and transport across membranes. How transmembrane helix (TMH) sequences encode the topology and conformational flexibility regulating these functions remains poorly understood. Here we describe a comprehensive analysis of the sequencestructure relationships at multiple interacting TMHs from all membrane proteins with structures in the Protein Data Bank (PDB). We found that membrane proteins can be deconstructed in interacting TMH trimer units, which mostly fold into six distinct structural classes of topologies and conformations. Each class is enriched in recurrent sequence motifs from functionally unrelated proteins, revealing unforeseen consensus and evolutionary conserved networks of stabilizing interhelical contacts. Interacting TMHs' topology and local protein conformational flexibility were remarkably well predicted in a blinded fashion from the identified bindinghotspot motifs. Our results reveal universal sequencestructure principles governing the complex anatomy and plasticity of multipass membrane proteins that may guide de novo structure prediction, design, and studies of folding and dynamics.",Xiang Feng; Patrick Barth,Biochemistry; Bioinformatics; Protein structure predictions,"Department of Pharmacology, Baylor College of Medicine, One Baylor Plaza, Houston, USA; Department of Pharmacology, Baylor College of Medicine, One Baylor Plaza, Houston, USA; Verna and Marrs McLean Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, USA; Structural and Computational Biology and Molecular Biophysics Graduate Program, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, USA"

Alternatively, cationic liposomal components or polymers can be used to encapsulate multiple CRISPR components into large particles (typically 100 nm diameter); however, such systems are limited by variability in the loading of the cargo. Here, we report the design of customizable synthetic nanoparticles for the delivery of Cas9 nuclease and a singleguide RNA (sgRNA) that enables the controlled stoichiometry of CRISPR components and limits the possible safety concerns in vivo. We describe the synthesis of a thin glutathione (GSH)cleavable covalently crosslinked polymer coating, called a nanocapsule (NC), around a preassembled ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complex between a Cas9 nuclease and an sgRNA. The NC is synthesized by in situ polymerization, has a hydrodynamic diameter of 25 nm and can be customized via facile surface modification. NCs efficiently generate targeted gene edits in vitro without any apparent cytotoxicity. Furthermore, NCs produce robust gene editing in vivo in murine retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) tissue and skeletal muscle after local administration.

466e8657bebb473e864fdd78683f7837,Reconciling globalmodel estimates and country reporting of anthropogenic forest CO 2 sinks,"Achieving the longterm temperature goal of the Paris Agreement requires forestbased mitigation. Collective progress towards this goal will be assessed by the Paris Agreement's Global stocktake. At present, there is a discrepancy of about 4 GtCO2 yr1 in global anthropogenic net landuse emissions between global models (reflected in IPCC assessment reports) and aggregated national GHG inventories (under the UNFCCC). We show that a substantial part of this discrepancy (about 3.2 GtCO2 yr1) can be explained by conceptual differences in anthropogenic forest sink estimation, related to the representation of environmental change impacts and the areas considered as managed. For a more credible tracking of collective progress under the Global stocktake, these conceptual differences between models and inventories need to be reconciled. We implement a new method of disaggregation of global land model results that allows greater comparability with GHG inventories. This provides a deeper understanding of modelinventory differences, allowing more transparent analysis of forestbased mitigation and facilitating a more accurate Global stocktake. The modelinventory discrepancy in net landuse carbon emissions mainly results from conceptual differences in estimating anthropogenic forest sinks. A revised disaggregation of global land model results allows greater comparability with inventories.",Giacomo Grassi; Jo House; Werner A. Kurz; Alessandro Cescatti; Richard A. Houghton; Glen P.

a6eb05cdf7334400893006a9dded162e,Sensing Native Protein Solution Structures Using a Solidstate Nanopore: Unraveling the States of VEGF,"Monitoring individual proteins in solution while simultaneously obtaining tertiary and quaternary structural information is challenging. In this study, translocation of the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) protein through a solidstate nanopore (ssNP) produces distinct ioncurrent blockade amplitude levels and durations likely corresponding to monomer, dimer, and higher oligomeric states. Upon changing from a nonreducing to a reducing condition, ioncurrent blockage events from the monomeric state dominate, consistent with the expected reduction of the two interchain VEGF disulfide bonds. Cleavage by plasmin and application of either a positive or a negative NP bias results in nanopore signals corresponding either to the VEGF receptor recognition domain or to the heparin binding domain, accordingly. Interestingly, multilevel analysis of VEGF events reveals how individual domains affect their translocation pattern. Our study shows that careful characterization of ssNP results elucidates realtime structural information about the protein, thereby complementing classical techniques for structural analysis of proteins in solution with the added advantage of quantitative singlemolecule resolution of native proteins.",Nitinun Varongchayakul; Diana Huttner; Mark W.

7ce65d87a8a944d88579c9d932b563db,Phosphorylation of conserved phosphoinositide binding pocket regulates sorting nexin membrane targeting,"Sorting nexins anchor trafficking machines to membranes by binding phospholipids. The paradigm of the superfamily is sorting nexin 3 (SNX3), which localizes to early endosomes by recognizing phosphatidylinositol 3phosphate (PI3P) to initiate retromermediated segregation of cargoes to the transGolgi network (TGN). Here we report the solution structure of full length human SNX3, and show that PI3P recognition is accompanied by bilayer insertion of a proximal loop in its extended Phox homology (PX) domain. Phosphoinositide (PIP) binding is completely blocked by cancerlinked phosphorylation of a conserved serine beside the stereospecific PI3P pocket. This ""PIPstop"" releases endosomal SNX3 to the cytosol, and reveals how protein kinases control membrane assemblies. It constitutes a widespread regulatory element found across the PX superfamily and throughout evolution including of fungi and plants. This illuminates the mechanism of a biological switch whereby structured PIP sites are phosphorylated to liberate protein machines from organelle surfaces. Sorting nexin 3 (SNX3) is a phosphatidylinositol 3phosphate binding protein that localizes to early endosomes. Here the authors use NMR to resolve SNX3s membrane interactions, revealing that membrane binding is regulated through phosphorylation of a conserved serine by its lipid recognition site.",Marc Lenoir; Cansel Ustunel; Sandya Rajesh; Jaswant Kaur; Dimitri Moreau; Jean Gruenberg; Michael Overduin,Endosomes; Solutionstate NMR,"School of Cancer Sciences, College of Medical and Dental Sciences, University of Birmingham, Edgbaston, Birmingham, UK; Biochemistry Department, University of Geneva, Geneva 4, Switzerland; School of Cancer Sciences, College of Medical and Dental Sciences, University of Birmingham, Edgbaston, Birmingham, UK; School of Cancer Sciences, College of Medical and Dental Sciences, University of Birmingham, Edgbaston, Birmingham, UK; Biochemistry Department, University of Geneva, Geneva 4, Switzerland; Biochemistry Department, University of Geneva, Geneva 4, Switzerland; Department of Biochemistry, Faculty of Medicine  Dentistry, University of Alberta, Edmonton, Canada"

Here we investigate the evolution of largely disjunct (and potentially reproductively isolated) phylogeographic lineages within the amphiboreal kelp Saccharina latissima s. l. Using molecular data (COI, microsatellites) we confirm that S. latissima comprises also the NE Pacific S. cichorioides complex and is composed of divergent lineages with limited range overlap and genetic admixture. Only a few genetic hybrids were detected throughout a Canadian ArcticNW Greenland contact zone. The degree of genetic differentiation and sympatric isolation of phylogroups suggest that S. latissima s. l. represents a complex of incipient species. Phylogroup distributions compared with paleoenvironmental reconstructions of the cryosphere further suggest that diversification within S. latissima results from chronic glacial isolation in disjunct persistence areas intercalated with ephemeral interglacial poleward expansions and admixture at highlatitude (Arctic) contact zones. This study thus supports a role for glaciations not just in redistributing preexisting marine lineages but also as a speciation pump across multiglacial cycles for marine organisms otherwise exhibiting cosmopolite amphiboreal distributions.",Joao Neiva; Cristina Paulino; Mette M.

Both of them were incorporated inside the matrimid as the polymer matrix. Using our customdesigned membrane testing cell, it was observed that the MMMs showed up to 9% difference in CO2 permeability between its pristine and UVirradiated condition. This shows that the lightresponsive ability of the lightresponsive MOFs could still be maintained. Thus, this finding is applicable in designing a smart material. Apart from that, the MMMs also has the potential to be applied for postcombustion carbon capture. At loadings up to 15 wt%, both CO2 permeability and CO2N2 ideal selectivity could be significantly improved and surpassed the value exhibited by most of the MOFmatrimid MMM. Lastly the long term performance of the MMM was also evaluated and it was observed that both MMM could maintain their performance up to 1 month with only a slight decrease in CO2 permeability observed for 10 wt% PCN250matrimid. This study then opens up the possibility to fabricate a novel antiaging multifunctional membrane material that is applicable as a smart material and also in post combustion carbon capture applications.",Nicholaus Prasetya; Anastasia A.

Here we perform a crossspecies analysis by sequencing tumorgermline pairs from 46 primary human muscosal, 65 primary canine oral and 28 primary equine melanoma cases from mucosal sites. Analysis of these data reveals recurrently mutated driver genes shared between species such as NRAS, FAT4, PTPRJ, TP53 and PTEN, and pathogenic germline alleles of BRCA1, BRCA2 and TP53. We identify a UV mutation signature in a small number of samples, including human cases from the lip and nasal mucosa. A crossspecies comparative analysis of recurrent copy number alterations identifies several candidate drivers including MDM2, B2M, KNSTRN and BUB1B. Comparison of somatic mutations in recurrences and metastases to those in the primary tumor suggests pervasive intratumor heterogeneity. Collectively, these studies suggest a convergence of some genetic changes in mucosal melanomas between species but also distinctly different paths to tumorigenesis. Mucosal melanoma is a rare melanoma subtype that is poorly characterised.

The secretory Cabinding phosphoprotein (SCPP) gene cluster at 4q13 encodes structurally related phosphoproteins of which some are specifically expressed at high levels in the salivary glands and constitute major components of saliva. Here we report on recurrent rearrangements t(4;9)(q13;q31)] in AciCC that translocate active enhancer regions from the SCPP gene cluster to the region upstream of Nuclear Receptor Subfamily 4 Group A Member 3 (NR4A3) at 9q31. We show that NR4A3 is specifically upregulated in AciCCs, and that active chromatin regions and gene expression signatures in AciCCs are highly correlated with the NR4A3 transcription factor binding motif. Overexpression of NR4A3 in mouse salivary gland cells increases expression of known NR4A3 target genes and has a stimulatory functional effect on cell proliferation. We conclude that NR4A3 is upregulated through enhancer hijacking and has important oncogenic functions in AciCC. Acinic cell carcinoma (AciCC) is a rare salivary gland carcinoma that is poorly understood.

Consecutive HFpEF patients underwent invasive hemodynamic assessment, cardiac magnetic resonance imaging and exercise testing. Study endpoints were: cardiac death, a combined endpoint of HF hospitalization or cardiac death and allcause death. 260 HFpEF patients were prospectively enrolled. Men were more compromised with regard to exercise capacity and had significantly more comorbidities. Men had more pronounced pulmonary vascular disease with higher diastolic pressure gradients and a lower right ventricular EF. During followup, 9.2% experienced cardiac death, 33.5% the combined endpoint and 17.3% allcause death. Male gender was independently associated with cardiac death, but neither with the combined endpoint nor with allcause mortality. We detected clear gender differences in HFpEF patients.

1d7fd8ff91ce4fe2b693dafa64bc29dc,"Serum exosomes contain ECRG 4 mRNA that suppresses tumor growth via inhibition of genes involved in inflammation, cell proliferation, and angiogenesis","Esophageal cancer related gene4 (Ecrg4) has been shown to be a tumor suppressor in many organs. Exosomes are naturally secreted nanosized particles that carry signal molecules including microRNAs (miRNAs), long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs), and messenger RNAs (mRNAs) among others. Upon internalization, exosomes unload their cargos that in turn modulate the biology of the recipient cells. Mounting evidence has shown that exosomal miRNAs are functional. However, reports that exosomes carry functional mRNAs remain scarce. We found that serum exosomes contain ECRG4 open reading frame. To simulate serum exosomal ECRG4, stable cell line expressing ECRG4 was created, from which exosomes were isolated and characterized, and the internalization and the resulting biological effects of exosomal ECRG4 were evaluated. Results showed that serum exosomes contain higher levels of ECRG4 mRNA in healthy individuals than their cancer counterparts. Exosomal ECRG4 can be internalized and unload the encapsulated ECRG4 into recipient cells, which subsequently suppressed cell proliferation in vitro, and inhibited tumor growth in a xenograft mouse model. Mechanistically, ECRG4containing exosomes, when internalized, suppressed the expression of genes commonly implicated in inflammation, cell proliferation, and angiogenesis. Given that exosome is an ideal vehicle for therapeutics delivery and that ECRG4 is a tumor suppressor gene, the exosomal ECRG4 can be exploited as a formulation for cancer gene therapy.",Liang Mao; Xue Li; Shu Gong; Haiyang Yuan; Yu Jiang; Wenjun Huang; Xingwang Sun; Xitong Dang,Drug development,"Institute of Cardiovascular Research, The Key Laboratory of Medical Electrophysiology, Ministry of Education, Southwest Medical University, Luzhou, China; Institute of Cardiovascular Research, The Key Laboratory of Medical Electrophysiology, Ministry of Education, Southwest Medical University, Luzhou, China; Department of Pathophysiology, Southwest Medical University, Luzhou, China; Institute of Cardiovascular Research, The Key Laboratory of Medical Electrophysiology, Ministry of Education, Southwest Medical University, Luzhou, China; Institute of Cardiovascular Research, The Key Laboratory of Medical Electrophysiology, Ministry of Education, Southwest Medical University, Luzhou, China; Institute of Cardiovascular Research, The Key Laboratory of Medical Electrophysiology, Ministry of Education, Southwest Medical University, Luzhou, China; Department of Pathology, Southwest Medical University, Luzhou, China; Institute of Cardiovascular Research, The Key Laboratory of Medical Electrophysiology, Ministry of Education, Southwest Medical University, Luzhou, China"

BC and adjacent normal tissues were collected from 165 BC patients. Western blotting and quantitative realtime PCR were used to detect the expression of GSK3, catenin, cyclinD1, Ecadherin, vimentin and miR135a in BC tissues and cells. Cells were assigned to blank, negative control (NC), miR135a mimics, miR135a inhibitors, small interfering RNA (siRNA)GSK3 or miR135a inhibitorssiRNAGSK3 groups. miR135a, catenin, cyclinD1 and vimentin expression increased, while GSK3 and Ecadherin expression decreased in BC tissues compared with adjacent normal tissues. Compared with the blank and NC groups, the expression of miR135a, catenin, cyclinD1 and vimentin was higher, and cell proliferation, migration, invasion and tumor growth were increased in the miR135a mimics and siRNAGSK3 groups. These groups showed an opposite trend in GSK3 and Ecadherin expression and cell apoptosis. The miR135a inhibitors group was inversely correlated with the blank and NC groups. It was concluded that miR135a accelerates the EMT, invasion and migration of BC cells by activating the Wntcatenin signaling pathway through the downregulation of GSK3 expression. The small regulatory RNA molecule microRNA135a contributes to bladder cancer by stimulating cell proliferation and migration. Dr Nan Zhang and colleagues at Zhejiang University Medical College in Hangzhou, China, examined both bladder cancer and adjacent normal tissues in 156 patients. The levels of microRNA135a and of the signaling protein catenin were higher in the cancerous tissue. In contrast, the levels of the tumor suppressor glycogen synthase kinase3 beta (GSK3) were lower, suggesting that microRNA135a triggers signaling through the Wntcatenin pathway. This evolutionarily conserved pathway is crucial for orchestrating development and when deregulated can lead to diseases including cancer and osteoporosis. Increased expression of microRNA135a stimulated cell proliferation and motility in human bladder cells and tumor growth in mice through this signaling pathway. These findings could lead to new treatment strategies for bladder cancer patients.",XiaWa Mao; JiaQuan Xiao; ZhongYi Li; YiChun Zheng; Nan Zhang,Bladder cancer,"Department of Urology Surgery, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University Medical College, Hangzhou, P.R.

ebbc27ea75364eae837522abf8f4984a,Impact of graftversushost disease on relapse and survival after allogeneic stem cell transplantation for pediatric leukemia,"Graftversushost disease (GVHD) occasionally leads to morbidity and mortality but is thought to reduce the risk of relapses in patients with a hematological malignancy. However, information on the effect of GVHD in pediatric leukemia is limited. Using a nationwide registry, we retrospectively analyzed 1526 children who underwent allogeneic stem cell transplantation for leukemia. Grades 0I acute GVHD were associated with a higher relapse rate at three years after transplantation, at 25.4 and 24.3%, respectively, than grades II, III, or IV acute GVHD at 18.9%, 21.2%, and 2.6%, respectively. In contrast, the overall survival curve of the grades 0 and I GVHD groups (79.0% and 79.5%, respectively) approximated that of the grade II GVHD group (76.3%), and the probability of survival was worst in the severe GVHD groups (66.9% for grade III and 42.5% for grade IV). Chronic GVHD also reduced the relapse risk but conferred no survival advantage. Acute lymphoblastic leukemia was more sensitive to acute GVHD than acute myeloid leukemia (AML) while AML was more sensitive to chronic GVHD.

f7c9e28a83f6492ba3392670f7172029,Structural basis of trans synaptic interactions between PTP and SALMs for inducing synapse formation,"Synapse formation is triggered by transsynaptic interactions of cell adhesion molecules, termed synaptic organizers. Three members of typeII receptor protein tyrosine phosphatases (classified as typeIIa RPTPs; PTP, PTP and LAR) are known as presynaptic organizers. Synaptic adhesionlike molecules (SALMs) have recently emerged as a family of postsynaptic organizers. Although all five SALM isoforms can bind to the typeIIa RPTPs, only SALM3 and SALM5 reportedly have synaptogenic activities depending on their binding. Here, we report the crystal structures of apoSALM5, and PTPSALM2 and PTPSALM5 complexes. The leucinerich repeat (LRR) domains of SALMs interact with the second immunoglobulinlike (Ig) domain of PTP, whereas the Ig domains of SALMs interact with both the second and third Ig domains of PTP. Unexpectedly, the structures exhibit the LRRmediated 2:2 complex. Our synaptogenic coculture assay using sitedirected SALM5 mutants demonstrates that presynaptic differentiation induced by PTPSALM5 requires the dimeric property of SALM5. Synaptic organizers are cell adhesion molecules that facilitate synapse formation through transsynaptic interactions. Here the authors give molecular insights into synaptic differentiation by determining the structures of the synaptic adhesionlike molecules SALM2 and SALM5 bound to the presynaptic organizer PTP.",Sakurako GotoIto; Atsushi Yamagata; Yusuke Sato; Takeshi Uemura; Tomoko Shiroshima; Asami Maeda; Ayako Imai; Hisashi Mori; Tomoyuki Yoshida; Shuya Fukai,Molecular neuroscience; Xray crystallography,"Institute of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan; Synchrotron Radiation Research Organization, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan; CREST, JST, Saitama, Japan; Institute of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan; Synchrotron Radiation Research Organization, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan; CREST, JST, Saitama, Japan; Department of Medical Genome Sciences, Graduate School of Frontier Sciences, The University of Tokyo, Chiba, Japan; Institute of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan; Synchrotron Radiation Research Organization, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan; CREST, JST, Saitama, Japan; Department of Medical Genome Sciences, Graduate School of Frontier Sciences, The University of Tokyo, Chiba, Japan; CREST, JST, Saitama, Japan; Department of Molecular and Cellular Physiology, Shinshu University School of Medicine, Nagano, Japan; Department of Biological Sciences for Intractable Neurological Diseases, Institute for Biomedical Sciences, Interdisciplinary Cluster for Cutting Edge Research, Shinshu University, Nagano, Japan; Institute of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan; Synchrotron Radiation Research Organization, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan; CREST, JST, Saitama, Japan; Institute of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan; Synchrotron Radiation Research Organization, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan; CREST, JST, Saitama, Japan; Department of Molecular Neuroscience, Graduate School of Medicine and Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Toyama, Toyama, Japan; Department of Molecular Neuroscience, Graduate School of Medicine and Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Toyama, Toyama, Japan; Department of Molecular Neuroscience, Graduate School of Medicine and Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Toyama, Toyama, Japan; PRESTO, JST, Saitama, Japan; Institute of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan; Synchrotron Radiation Research Organization, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan; CREST, JST, Saitama, Japan; Department of Medical Genome Sciences, Graduate School of Frontier Sciences, The University of Tokyo, Chiba, Japan"

We examined the prevalence of metabolic syndrome in relation to H. pylori infection and its symptoms in a large and unselected population. Coded data from the computerised database of a large health maintenance organisation in Israel were accessed for 147,936 individuals 2595 years of age who performed the urea breath test during 20022012. The classification of metabolic syndrome followed a modified definition of the international diabetes federation. Prevalences of H. pylori infection and metabolic syndrome were 52.0% and 11.4% respectively. H. pylori infected patients had increased likelihood of metabolic syndrome: adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 1.15 (95% confidence intervals (CI) 1.101.19), as did patients with gastric ulcer: aOR 1.15 (95% CI 1.031.28) vs patients without these conditions. Duodenal ulcer was associated with metabolic syndrome only in persons aged 2534 years: aOR 1.59 (95% CI 1.192.13), but not in older persons (P  0.001 for heterogeneity). In conclusion, the likelihood of metabolic syndrome appeared significantly increased in relation to H. pylori infection and gastric and duodenal ulcers.

Hyperglycemia plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of microvascular complications, such as diabetic retinopathy, incipient nephropathy, and neuropathy, while atherosclerosis contributes to the pathogenesis of macrovascular complications. Diabetes mellitus and hypertension are frequently present together. Among many microvascular diabetic complications, hypertension plays a predominant role in the progression of diabetic nephropathy by glomerular hyperfiltration. Hypertension also induces atherosclerosis in diabetes. Thus, hypertension is a highrisk factor for both microvascular and macrovascular chronic diabetic complications. In this review, we summarize the current knowledge on the pathophysiological mechanisms of microvascular and macrovascular chronic diabetic complications with particular emphasis on the contribution of hypertension. We also briefly discuss various options available for the treatment of each diabetic complication.",Daisuke Yamazaki; Hirofumi Hitomi; Akira Nishiyama,"MedicinePublic Health, general; Internal Medicine; Public Health; GeriatricsGerontology; ObstetricsPerinatologyMidwifery; Health Promotion and Disease Prevention","Department of Pharmacology, Faculty of Medicine, Kagawa University, Kagawa, Japan; Department of Pharmacology, Faculty of Medicine, Kagawa University, Kagawa, Japan; Department of Pharmacology, Faculty of Medicine, Kagawa University, Kagawa, Japan"
4a33db0f25fd437bacf16336bc2e8921,Spatial competition constrains resistance to targeted cancer therapy,"Adaptive therapy (AT) aims to control tumour burden by maintaining therapysensitive cells to exploit their competition with resistant cells. This relies on the assumption that resistant cells have impaired cellular fitness. Here, using a model of resistance to a pharmacological cyclindependent kinase inhibitor (CDKi), we show that this assumption is valid when competition between cells is spatially structured. We generate CDKiresistant cancer cells and find that they have reduced proliferative fitness and stably rewired cell cycle control pathways. Lowdose CDKi outperforms highdose CDKi in controlling tumour burden and resistance in tumour spheroids, but not in monolayer culture. Mathematical modelling indicates that tumour spatial structure amplifies the fitness penalty of resistant cells, and identifies their relative fitness as a critical determinant of the clinical benefit of AT. Our results justify further investigation of AT with kinase inhibitors. Adaptive therapy aims to control tumours by exploiting competition between therapysensitive and resistant cells. Here, the authors show that tumour spatial structure is a critical parameter for adaptive therapy as competition for space increases fitness differentials, allowing suppression of resistance with lowdose treatments.",Katarina Bacevic; Robert Noble; Ahmed Soffar; Orchid Wael Ammar; Benjamin Boszonyik; Susana Prieto; Charles Vincent; Michael E.

Host and virus interactions occurring at the posttranscriptional level are critical for infection but remain poorly understood. Here, we performed comprehensive transcriptomewide analyses revealing that human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) infection results in widespread alternative splicing (AS), shortening of 3 untranslated regions (3 UTRs) and lengthening of poly(A)tails in host gene transcripts. We found that the host RNAbinding protein CPEB1 was highly induced after infection, and ectopic expression of CPEB1 in noninfected cells recapitulated infectionrelated posttranscriptional changes. CPEB1 was also required for poly(A)tail lengthening of viral RNAs important for productive infection. Strikingly, depletion of CPEB1 reversed infectionrelated cytopathology and posttranscriptional changes, and decreased productive HCMV titers. Host RNA processing was also altered in herpes simplex virus2 (HSV2)infected cells, thereby indicating that this phenomenon might be a common occurrence during herpesvirus infections.

                 Microtubulecrosslinking motor proteins, which slide antiparallel microtubules, are required for the remodeling of microtubule networks. Hitherto, all microtubulecrosslinking motors have been shown to slide microtubules at a constant velocity until no overlap remains between them, leading to the breakdown of the initial microtubule geometry. Here, we show in vitro that the sliding velocity of microtubules, driven by human kinesin14 HSET, decreases when microtubules start to slide apart, resulting in the maintenance of finitelength microtubule overlaps. We quantitatively explain this feedback using the local interaction kinetics of HSET with overlapping microtubules that cause retention of HSET in shortening overlaps. Consequently, the increased HSET density in the overlaps leads to a densitydependent decrease in sliding velocity and the generation of an entropic force that antagonizes the force exerted by the motors. Our results demonstrate that a spatial arrangement of microtubules can regulate the collective action of molecular motors through the local alteration of their individual interaction kinetics.",Marcus Braun; Zdenek Lansky; Agata Szuba; Friedrich W Schwarz; Aniruddha Mitra; Mengfei Gao; Annemarie Ludecke; Pieter Rein ten Wolde; Stefan Diez,Biophysics; Cell division; Imaging,"B CUBE Center for Molecular Bioengineering, Technische Universitat Dresden, Dresden, Germany; Max Planck Institute of Molecular Cell Biology and Genetics, Dresden, Germany; Institute of Biotechnology CAS, BIOCEV, Vestec, Czech Republic; B CUBE Center for Molecular Bioengineering, Technische Universitat Dresden, Dresden, Germany; Max Planck Institute of Molecular Cell Biology and Genetics, Dresden, Germany; Institute of Biotechnology CAS, BIOCEV, Vestec, Czech Republic; B CUBE Center for Molecular Bioengineering, Technische Universitat Dresden, Dresden, Germany; Max Planck Institute of Molecular Cell Biology and Genetics, Dresden, Germany; B CUBE Center for Molecular Bioengineering, Technische Universitat Dresden, Dresden, Germany; Max Planck Institute of Molecular Cell Biology and Genetics, Dresden, Germany; B CUBE Center for Molecular Bioengineering, Technische Universitat Dresden, Dresden, Germany; Max Planck Institute of Molecular Cell Biology and Genetics, Dresden, Germany; B CUBE Center for Molecular Bioengineering, Technische Universitat Dresden, Dresden, Germany; Max Planck Institute of Molecular Cell Biology and Genetics, Dresden, Germany; B CUBE Center for Molecular Bioengineering, Technische Universitat Dresden, Dresden, Germany; Max Planck Institute of Molecular Cell Biology and Genetics, Dresden, Germany; AMOLF, Amsterdam, The Netherlands; B CUBE Center for Molecular Bioengineering, Technische Universitat Dresden, Dresden, Germany; Max Planck Institute of Molecular Cell Biology and Genetics, Dresden, Germany"

Paradoxically, its great sensitivity to small variations of local environment becomes a handicap for heterogeneous systems, such as are encountered in environmental, medical, ancient materials sciences and engineering. Here we demonstrate that a novel fullfield photoluminescence imaging approach allows accessing the spatial distribution of crystal defect fluctuations at the crystallite level across centimetrewide fields of view. This capacity is illustrated in archaeology and material sciences. The coexistence of two hitherto indistinguishable nonstoichiometric cuprous oxide phases is revealed in a 6,000yearold amulet from Mehrgarh (Baluchistan, Pakistan), identified as the oldest known artefact made by lostwax casting and providing a better understanding of this fundamental invention. Lowconcentration crystal defect fluctuations are readily mapped within ZnO nanowires. High spatial dynamicsphotoluminescence imaging holds great promise for the characterization of bulk heterogeneous systems across multiple disciplines. Photoluminescence is a powerful probe of chemical composition and structure, but it is challenging to image heterogeneous materials over large scale. Thoury et al. develop a fullfield imaging approach to map two cuprous oxide phases in the earliest known lostwax cast artefact manufactured 6,000 years ago.

Cardiolipin is a nonbilayer anionic phospholipid found in bacterial inner membrane. It forms lipid microdomains located at the cell poles and division plane. Mechanisms by which microdomains are affected by membraneacting antibiotics and the impact of these alterations on membrane properties and protein functions remain unclear. In this study, we demonstrated cardiolipin relocation and clustering as a result of exposure to a cardiolipinacting amphiphilic aminoglycoside antibiotic, the 3,6dinonyl neamine. Changes in the biophysical properties of the bacterial membrane of P. aeruginosa, including decreased fluidity and increased permeability, were observed. Cardiolipininteracting proteins and functions regulated by cardiolipin were impacted by the amphiphilic aminoglycoside as we demonstrated an inhibition of respiratory chain and changes in bacterial shape. The latter effect was characterized by the loss of bacterial rod shape through a decrease in length and increase in curvature. It resulted from the effect on MreB, a cardiolipin dependent cytoskeleton protein as well as a direct effect of 3,6dinonyl neamine on cardiolipin.

479ecee0a5f74e99bd0983ccb5cee401,Population extinctions can increase metapopulation persistence,"Metapopulations persist when local populations are rapidly recolonized following local extinctions. Such persistence requires asynchrony; simultaneous crashes of all populations would leave no source of recolonization. We show theoretically and experimentally that catastrophic population extinctions themselves can promote metapopulation persistence, by preventing spatial synchrony and thus enhancing recolonization. We refer to this behaviour as the 'spatial hydra effect': as with the mythical hydra that grows two new heads when one is removed, extinctions can increase recolonization. The effect is robust, occurring in a wide range of theoretical models exhibiting cyclic or quasicyclic population dynamics. In a laboratory microcosm experiment using cyclic protist predatorprey metapopulations, catastrophic perturbations wiping out populations but leaving the patch otherwise unchanged increased metapopulation persistence when high dispersal rates would otherwise have led to spatially synchronous extinctions of all populations. We discuss several candidate examples of the spatial hydra effect in nature.

However, our ability to examine its biological function and role in disease is limited by the large amounts of starting material required to perform current experimental approaches. Here, we present LowC, a HiC method for low amounts of input material. By systematically comparing HiC libraries made with decreasing amounts of starting material we show that LowC is highly reproducible and robust to experimental noise. To demonstrate the suitability of LowC to analyse rare cell populations, we produce LowC maps from primary Bcells of a diffuse large Bcell lymphoma patient. We detect a common reciprocal translocation t(3;14)(q27;q32) affecting the BCL6 and IGH loci and abundant local structural variation between the patient and healthy Bcells. The ability to study chromatin conformation in primary tissue will be fundamental to fully understand the molecular pathogenesis of diseases and to eventually guide personalised therapeutic strategies. Chromatin conformation studies are limited by the large amounts of starting material required to perform current protocols.

Here we engineered MitoTag mice, which express a Cre recombinasedependent green fluorescent protein targeted to the outer mitochondrial membrane, and developed an isolation approach to profile tagged mitochondria from defined cell types. We determined the mitochondrial proteome of the three major cerebellar cell types (Purkinje cells, granule cells and astrocytes) and identified hundreds of mitochondrial proteins that are differentially regulated. Thus, we provide markers of celltypespecific mitochondria for the healthy and diseased mouse and human central nervous systems, including in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and Alzheimer's disease. Based on proteomic predictions, we demonstrate that astrocytic mitochondria metabolize longchain fatty acids more efficiently than neuronal mitochondria. We also characterize celltype differences in mitochondrial calcium buffering via the mitochondrial calcium uniporter (Mcu) and identify regulator of microtubule dynamics protein 3 (Rmdn3) as a determinant of endoplasmic reticulummitochondria proximity in Purkinje cells. Our approach enables exploring mitochondrial diversity in many in vivo contexts. Fecher et al. devise an approach to isolate celltypespecific mitochondria from the mouse CNS.

e4512111ddc84c18bd871182eb1ab0dc,Caveolin1 mediates cellular distribution of HER2 and affects trastuzumab binding and therapeutic efficacy,"Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) gene amplification andor protein overexpression in tumors is a prerequisite for initiation of trastuzumab therapy. Although HER2 is a cell membrane receptor, differential rates of endocytosis and recycling engender a dynamic surface pool of HER2. Since trastuzumab must bind to the extracellular domain of HER2, a depressed HER2 surface pool hinders binding. Using in vivo biological models and cultures of fresh human tumors, we find that the caveolin1 (CAV1) protein is involved in HER2 cell membrane dynamics within the context of receptor endocytosis. The translational significance of this finding is highlighted by our observation that temporal CAV1 depletion with lovastatin increases HER2 halflife and availability at the cell membrane resulting in improved trastuzumab binding and therapy against HER2positive tumors. These data show the important role that CAV1 plays in the effectiveness of trastuzumab to target HER2positive tumors. Trastuzumab binding to tumor cells depends on the availability of HER2 at the cell membrane. Here the authors show that caveolin1 (CAV1) regulates HER2 density at the cell membranes and that CAV1 gene knockdown or protein depletion via the cholesterol modulator lovastatin, increases trastuzumab binding and antitumor activity.",Patricia M.

0382bcbc00cb40668004e088ad7b0041,Cotransmission of acetylcholine and GABA regulates hippocampal states,"The basal forebrain cholinergic system is widely assumed to control cortical functions via nonsynaptic transmission of a single neurotransmitter. Yet, we find that mouse hippocampal cholinergic terminals invariably establish GABAergic synapses, and their cholinergic vesicles dock at those synapses only. We demonstrate that these synapses do not corelease but cotransmit GABA and acetylcholine via different vesicles, whose release is triggered by distinct calcium channels. This cotransmission evokes composite postsynaptic potentials, which are mutually crossregulated by presynaptic autoreceptors. Although postsynaptic cholinergic receptor distribution cannot be investigated, their response latencies suggest a focal, intra andor perisynaptic localisation, while GABAA receptors are detected intrasynaptically. The GABAergic component alone effectively suppresses hippocampal sharp waveripples and epileptiform activity. Therefore, the differentially regulated GABAergic and cholinergic cotransmission suggests a hitherto unrecognised level of control over cortical states. This novel model of hippocampal cholinergic neurotransmission may lead to alternative pharmacotherapies after cholinergic deinnervation seen in neurodegenerative disorders. Acetylcholine (ACh) release in the central nervous system is thought to be unitary and mediated nonsynaptically in volume transmission. Here, Takacs and colleagues show cholinergic terminals juxtapose GABAergic synapses anatomically and functionally, and GABA and ACh molecules are cotransmitted.",Virag T.

These cells also metabolize sugars using a respiratory system that functionally overlaps the photosynthetic apparatus. In this study, we describe the harvesting of photocurrent used for hydrogen production from live cyanobacteria. A nonharmful gentle physical treatment of the cyanobacterial cells enables lightdriven electron transfer by an endogenous mediator to a graphite electrode in a biophotoelectrochemical cell, without the addition of sacrificial electron donors or acceptors. We show that the photocurrent is derived from photosystem I and that the electrons originate from carbohydrates digested by the respiratory system. Finally, the current is utilized for hydrogen evolution on the cathode at a bias of 0.65 V. Taken together, we present a biophotoelectrochemical system where live cyanobacteria produce stable photocurrent that can generate hydrogen. Biologically  produced electrical currents and hydrogen are new energy sources. Here, the authors find that low presser microfluidizer treatment produced cyanobacterium that can utilize electrons from respiratory and photosynthesis to promote current and hydrogen generation, without the addition of exogenous electron mediators.",Gadiel Saper; Dan Kallmann; Felipe Conzuelo; Fangyuan Zhao; Tunde N.

364298bd64e54f3d8fbc3dac6b81f3ae,Roomtemperature stabilization of antiferromagnetic skyrmions in synthetic antiferromagnets,"Roomtemperature skyrmions in ferromagnetic films and multilayers show promise for encoding information bits in new computing technologies. Despite recent progress, ferromagnetic order generates dipolar fields that prevent ultrasmall skyrmion sizes, and allows a transverse deflection of moving skyrmions that hinders their efficient manipulation. Antiferromagnetic skyrmions shall lift these limitations. Here we demonstrate that roomtemperature antiferromagnetic skyrmions can be stabilized in synthetic antiferromagnets (SAFs), in which perpendicular magnetic anisotropy, antiferromagnetic coupling and chiral order can be adjusted concurrently. Utilizing interlayer electronic coupling to an adjacent bias layer, we demonstrate that spinspiral states obtained in a SAF with vanishing perpendicular magnetic anisotropy can be turned into isolated antiferromagnetic skyrmions. We also provide modelbased estimates of skyrmion size and stability, showing that roomtemperature antiferromagnetic skyrmions below 10 nm in radius can be anticipated in further optimized SAFs. Antiferromagnetic skyrmions in SAFs may thus solve major issues associated with ferromagnetic skyrmions for lowpower spintronic devices. Antiferromagnetic skyrmionswhich have distinct advantages over skyrmions found in other magnetic systemsare observed at room temperature in synthetic antiferromagnets.

Most interesting is the strict resonant excitation of such emitters to control their occupation coherently and to generate close to ideal quantum light, which is of utmost importance for applications in photonic quantum technology. To date, the approaches and experiments in this field have been performed exclusively using bulky lasers, which hinders the application of resonantly driven twolevel emitters in compact photonic quantum systems. Here we address this issue and present a concept for a compact resonantly driven singlephoton source by performing quantumoptical spectroscopy of a twolevel system using a compact high microlaser as the excitation source. The twolevel system is based on a semiconductor quantum dot (QD), which is excited resonantly by a fibercoupled electrically driven micropillar laser. We dress the excitonic state of the QD under continuous wave excitation, and trigger the emission of single photons with strong multiphoton suppression (

These results clearly demonstrate the high potential of our resonant excitation scheme, which can pave the way for compact electrically driven quantum light sources with excellent quantum properties to enable the implementation of advanced quantum communication protocols. Sending encrypted quantum data over long distances is set to become more feasible using a lowcost system for generating photons one at a time. Repeating signals in a quantum network requires techniques for emitting single photons that preserve information such as polarization states. Stephan Reitzenstein from the Technische Universitat Berlin, Germany, and coworkers report that bulky lasers used in typical quantum repeaters can be downsized using lowdimensional semiconductor nanostructures known as quantum dots. They fabricated micropillar structures, each containing aluminumgalliumarsenicbased quantum dots as active medium, which produce coherent laser pulses when electrically stimulated. By directing the micropillardriven pulses onto another quantum dot that resonates after absorbing laser light, the team triggered emission of highquality, individual photons that may be beneficial for the implementation of longdistance quantum communication protocols.",Soren Kreinberg; Tomislav Grbesic; Max Strau; Alexander Carmele; Monika Emmerling; Christian Schneider; Sven Hofling; Xavier Porte; Stephan Reitzenstein,Nearinfrared spectroscopy; Photonic devices; Semiconductor lasers; Single photons and quantum effects,"Institut fur Festkorperphysik, Technische Universitat Berlin, Berlin, Germany; Institut fur Festkorperphysik, Technische Universitat Berlin, Berlin, Germany; Institut fur Festkorperphysik, Technische Universitat Berlin, Berlin, Germany; Institut fur Theoretische Physik, Technische Universitat Berlin, Berlin, Germany; Technische Physik, JuliusMaximiliansUniversitat Wurzburg, Wurzburg, Germany; Technische Physik, JuliusMaximiliansUniversitat Wurzburg, Wurzburg, Germany; Technische Physik, JuliusMaximiliansUniversitat Wurzburg, Wurzburg, Germany; SUPA, School of Physics and Astronomy, University of St Andrews, St Andrews, UK; Institut fur Festkorperphysik, Technische Universitat Berlin, Berlin, Germany; Institut fur Festkorperphysik, Technische Universitat Berlin, Berlin, Germany"

Direct targeting of AR has valuable therapeutic potential. However, the lack of disease relevant cellular methodologies capable of discriminating between inhibitors that directly bind AR and those that instead act on AR coregulators has made identification of novel antagonists challenging. The Cellular Thermal Shift Assay (CETSA) is a technology enabling confirmation of direct target engagement with labelfree, endogenous protein in living cells. We report the development of the first highthroughput CETSA assay (CETSA HT) to identify direct AR binders in a prostate cancer cell line endogenously expressing AR. Using this approach, we screened a pharmacology library containing both compounds reported to directly engage AR, and compounds expected to target AR coregulators. Our results show that CETSA HT exclusively identifies direct AR binders, differentiating them from coregulator inhibitors where other cellular assays measuring functional responses cannot. Using this CETSA HT approach we can derive apparent binding affinities for a range of AR antagonists, which represent an intracellular measure of antagonistreceptor Ki performed for the first time in a labelfree, diseaserelevant context.

However, the complex 3D structure of lignocellulosic biomass is recalcitrant to deconstruction. Major efforts to overcome this recalcitrance have involved pretreating biomass before catalytic processing. This Perspective describes recent work aimed at elucidating the molecularlevel physical phenomena that drive biomass assembly. These are at play in commonly employed aqueousbased and thermochemical pretreatments. Several key processes have been found to be driven by biomass solvation thermodynamics, an understanding of which therefore facilitates the rational improvement of methods aimed at the complete solubilization and fractionation of the major biomass components. This Perspective describes the physical molecular driving forces that stabilize native lignocellulosic plant biomass structures and govern thermochemical biomass pretreatments. Understanding these driving forces can help us to design efficient methods for deconstructing biomass into biofuels and other bioproducts.

Different forms of arthritis affect ~50 million people in the USA alone, and it is therefore crucial to identify methods that will halt or slow the progression to arthritis, starting with the initiating events of cartilage and meniscus defects. The surgical approaches in current use have a limited capacity for tissue regeneration and yield only shortterm relief of symptoms. Tissue engineering approaches are emerging as alternatives to current surgical methods for cartilage and meniscus repair. Several cellbased and tissueengineered products are currently in clinical trials for cartilage lesions and meniscal tears, opening new avenues for cartilage and meniscus regeneration. This Review provides a summary of surgical techniques, including tissueengineered products, that are currently in clinical use, as well as a discussion of stateoftheart tissue engineering strategies and technologies that are being developed for use in articular cartilage and meniscus repair and regeneration. The obstacles to clinical translation of these strategies are also included to inform the development of innovative tissue engineering approaches. Tissue engineering strategies to repair articular cartilage and menisci are advancing rapidly. This Review provides an overview of surgical and tissue engineering approaches in current use and outlines exciting developments in the field.

However, less is known about the role of epigenetics in this process. Although previous studies have identified eye development genes associated with the lossofeyes phenotype in the Pachon blind cave morph of the Mexican tetra Astyanax mexicanus, no inactivating mutations have been found in any of these genes. Here, we show that excess DNA methylationbased epigenetic silencing promotes eye degeneration in blind cave A. mexicanus. By performing parallel analyses in A. mexicanus cave and surface morphs, and in the zebrafish Danio rerio, we have discovered that DNA methylation mediates eyespecific gene repression and globally regulates early eye development. The most significantly hypermethylated and downregulated genes in the cave morph are also linked to human eye disorders, suggesting that the function of these genes is conserved across vertebrates. Our results show that changes in DNA methylationbased gene repression can serve as an important molecular mechanism generating phenotypic diversity during development and evolution. Loss of eyes is a common feature of caveadapted animals such as the blind cave morphs of Astyanax mexicanus. Here, the authors show that DNA methylation mediates eyespecific gene repression and globally regulates early eye development in A. mexicanus.",Aniket V. Gore; Kelly A.

Global Hg models have postulated that Hg(II) reduction in the atmosphere occurs through aqueousphase photoreduction that may take place in clouds. Here we report that experimental rainfall Hg(II) photoreduction rates are much slower than modelled rates. We compute absorption cross sections of Hg(II) compounds and show that fast gasphase Hg(II) photolysis can dominate atmospheric mercury reduction and lead to a substantial increase in the modelled, global atmospheric Hg lifetime by a factor two. Models with Hg(II) photolysis show enhanced Hg(0) deposition to land, which may prolong recovery of aquatic ecosystems long after Hg emissions are lowered, due to the longer residence time of Hg in soils compared with the ocean. Fast Hg(II) photolysis substantially changes atmospheric Hg dynamics and requires further assessment at regional and local scales. Reduction of gaseous Hg(II) compounds drives atmospheric mercury wet and dry deposition to Earth surface ecosystems. Global Hg models assume this reduction takes place in clouds. Here the authors report a new gasphase Hg photochemical mechanism that changes atmospheric mercury lifetime and its deposition to the surface.",Alfonso SaizLopez; Sebastian P.

9ffd79afb1bb4f9f8edb791a11e58317,The clinical role of the TME in solid cancer,"The highly complex and heterogenous ecosystem of a tumour not only contains malignant cells, but also interacting cells from the host such as endothelial cells, stromal fibroblasts, and a variety of immune cells that control tumour growth and invasion. It is well established that antitumour immunity is a critical hurdle that must be overcome for tumours to initiate, grow and spread and that antitumour immunity can be modulated using current immunotherapies to achieve meaningful antitumour clinical responses. Pioneering studies in melanoma, ovarian and colorectal cancer have demonstrated that certain features of the tumour immune microenvironment (TME)in particular, the degree of tumour infiltration by cytotoxic T cellscan predict a patient's clinical outcome. More recently, studies in renal cell cancer have highlighted the importance of assessing the phenotype of the infiltrating T cells to predict early relapse. Furthermore, intricate interactions with nonimmune cellular players such as endothelial cells and fibroblasts modulate the clinical impact of immune cells in the TME. Here, we review the critical components of the TME in solid tumours and how they shape the immune cell contexture, and we summarise numerous studies evaluating its clinical significance from a prognostic and theranostic perspective.",Nicolas A.

Elucidation of gliadin evolution provides knowledge to produce wheat with better enduse properties and reduced immunogenic potential. The Gli2 loci contain a large number of tandemly duplicated genes and highly repetitive DNA, making sequence assembly of their genomic regions challenging. Here, we constructed highquality sequences spanning the three wheat homeologous gliadin loci by aligning PacBiobased sequence contigs with BioNano genome maps. A total of 47 gliadin genes were identified with only 26 encoding intact fulllength protein products. Analyses of gliadin loci and phylogenetic tree reconstruction indicate significant duplications of gliadin genes in the last ~2.5 million years after the divergence of the A, B and D genomes, supporting its rapid lineageindependent expansion in different Triticeae genomes. We showed that dramatic divergence in expression of gliadin genes could not be attributed to sequence variations in the promoter regions. The study also provided insights into the evolution of CD epitopes and identified a single indel event in the hexaploid wheat D genome that likely resulted in the generation of the highly toxic 33mer CD epitope.",Naxin Huo; Tingting Zhu; Susan Altenbach; Lingli Dong; Yi Wang; Toni Mohr; Zhiyong Liu; Jan Dvorak; MingCheng Luo; Yong Q.

07ebbb9302a047dbb525fdf5aa7048b8,NKX25 regulates human cardiomyogenesis via a HEY2 dependent transcriptional network,"Congenital heart defects can be caused by mutations in genes that guide cardiac lineage formation. Here, we show deletion of NKX25, a critical component of the cardiac gene regulatory network, in human embryonic stem cells (hESCs), results in impaired cardiomyogenesis, failure to activate VCAM1 and to downregulate the progenitor marker PDGFR. Furthermore, NKX25 null cardiomyocytes have abnormal physiology, with asynchronous contractions and altered action potentials. Molecular profiling and genetic rescue experiments demonstrate that the bHLH protein HEY2 is a key mediator of NKX25 function during human cardiomyogenesis. These findings identify HEY2 as a novel component of the NKX25 cardiac transcriptional network, providing tangible evidence that hESC models can decipher the complex pathways that regulate early stage human heart development. These data provide a human context for the evaluation of pathogenic mutations in congenital heart disease. A gene regulatory network, including the transcription factor Nkx25, regulates cardiac development. Here, the authors show that on deletion of NKX25 from human embryonic stem cells, there is impaired cardiomyogenesis and changes in action potentials, and that this is regulated via HEY2.",David J.

ffeb02270e4843c3a4414cd123008f79,Conserved roles of C. elegans and human MANFs in sulfatide binding and cytoprotection,"Mesencephalic astrocytederived neurotrophic factor (MANF) is an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) protein that can be secreted and protects dopamine neurons and cardiomyocytes from ER stress and apoptosis. The mechanism of action of extracellular MANF has long been elusive. From a genetic screen for mutants with abnormal ER stress response, we identified the gene Y54G2A.23 as the evolutionarily conserved C. elegans MANF orthologue. We find that MANF binds to the lipid sulfatide, also known as 3Osulfogalactosylceramide present in serum and outercell membrane leaflets, directly in isolated forms and in reconstituted lipid micelles. Sulfatide binding promotes cellular MANF uptake and cytoprotection from hypoxiainduced cell death. Heightened ER stress responses of MANFnull C. elegans mutants and mammalian cells are alleviated by human MANF in a sulfatidedependent manner. Our results demonstrate conserved roles of MANF in sulfatide binding and ER stress response, supporting sulfatide as a longsought lipid mediator of MANF's cytoprotection. MANF is a secreted ER stressinducible protein that protects neurons, pancreatic  cells and cardiomyocytes from cell death under oxidative stress, hypoxic or ischemic conditions. Here the authors show that MANF confers cytoprotection through direct binding to sulfatide followed by cellular uptake in both C. elegans and mammalian cells.",Meirong Bai; Roman Vozdek; Ales Hnizda; Chenxiao Jiang; Bingying Wang; Ladislav Kuchar; Tiejun Li; Yuefan Zhang; Chase Wood; Liang Feng; Yongjun Dang; Dengke K.

Here we report an extensive molecular and immune profiling study of 245 Chinese patients with nonsmall cell lung cancer. Tumorinfiltrating lymphocyte estimated using immune cell signatures is found to be significantly higher in adenocarcinoma (ADC, 72.5%) compared with squamous cell carcinoma (SQCC, 54.4%). The correlation of genomic alterations with immune signatures reveals that low immune infiltration was associated with EGFR mutations in ADC samples, PI3K andor WNT pathway activation in SQCC. While KRAS mutations are found to be significantly associated with T cell infiltration in ADC samples. The SQCC patients with high antigen presentation machinery and cytotoxic T cell signature scores are found to have a prolonged overall survival time.

A higher level of hsa_circ_001783 was significantly correlated with heavier tumor burden and poorer prognosis of patients with breast cancer. Knockdown of this circRNA remarkably inhibited the proliferation and invasion of breast cancer cells. Importantly, hsa_circ_001783 promoted progression of breast cancer cells via sponging miR200c3p.

74e7de91769e454799f3b5e555614e30,Metallurgical investigation on fourth century BCE silver jewellery of two hoards from Samaria,"A fourth century BCE silver jewellery collection, which is part of two hoards of Samarian coins (the Samaria and Nablus Hoards), was studied by nondestructive analyses. The collection, which consists of pendants, rings, beads and earrings, had been examined by visual testing, multifocal microscopy and SEMEDS analysis. In order to enhance our knowledge of past technologies of silver jewellery production, we developed a metallurgical methodology based on the chemical composition of the joints and bulk. The results show that all artefacts are made of silver containing a small percentage of copper. Higher copper concentrations were measured in the joining regions. Our research indicates that the manufacturing of the jewellery from both hoards involved similar techniques, including casting, cutting, hammering, bending, granulating and joining methods, indicating that the artefacts were made by trained silversmiths. Although the burial date of the Samaria Hoard  352 BCE  is some 21 years earlier than that of the Nablus Hoard  circa 331 BCE, a noted continuity in the local production technology is apparent in the analysed items.

A structural model for monomeric, lipidfree apoAI, based on previous and new data, is now presented. Apolipoprotein (apo)AI is an organizing scaffold protein that is critical to highdensity lipoprotein (HDL) structure and metabolism, probably mediating many of its cardioprotective properties. However, HDL biogenesis is poorly understood, as lipidfree apoAI has been notoriously resistant to highresolution structural study. Published models from lowresolution techniques share certain features but vary considerably in shape and secondary structure. To tackle this central issue in lipoprotein biology, we assembled a team of structural biologists specializing in apolipoproteins and set out to build a consensus model of monomeric lipidfree human apoAI. Combining novel and published crosslink constraints, smallangle Xray scattering (SAXS), hydrogendeuterium exchange (HDX) and crystallography data, we propose a timeaveraged model consistent with much of the experimental data published over the last 40 years.

Twinning in aluminium, although difficult, may occur at low temperature and high strain rate. However, the 9R phase rarely occurs in aluminium simply because of its giant stacking fault energy. Here, by using a laserinduced projectile impact testing technique, we discover a deformationinduced 9R phase with tens of nm in width in ultrafinegrained aluminium with an average grain size of 140 nm, as confirmed by extensive postimpact microscopy analyses. The stability of the 9R phase is related to the existence of sessile Frank loops. Molecular dynamics simulations reveal the formation mechanisms of the 9R phase in aluminium. This study sheds lights on a deformation mechanism in metals with high stacking fault energies. Deformationinduced defects with high formation energy are difficult to nucleate in aluminium.

Here we use stimulated Raman adiabatic passage to generate microwave photon Fock states in a superconducting circuit quantum electrodynamics system comprised of a fixedfrequency transmon qubit in a threedimensional microwave cavity at 20 mK. A twophoton process is employed to overcome a first order forbidden transition and the first, second and third Fock states are demonstrated. We also demonstrate how this allmicrowave technique can be used to generate an arbitrary superposition of Fock states. Simulations of the system are in excellent agreement with the data and fidelities of 89%, 68% and 43% are inferred for the first three Fock states respectively. Precise quantum state preparation plays an important role in quantum information processing. Here, Premaratneet al. use stimulated Raman adiabatic passage to transfer population from a superconducting transmon qubit to a cavity Fock state.",Shavindra P. Premaratne; F. C. Wellstood; B. S.

Therefore, the noninvasive and precise laboratory diagnostic methods are needed. This study aimed to develop an objective method through screen potential biomarkers or a biomarker panel to facilitate the diagnosis in clinic using plasma metabolomics. Profiles were based on Hnuclear magnetic resonance (1HNMR) metabolomics techniques combing with multivariate statistical analysis. Furthermore, methods of correlation analysis with Metaboanalyst 3.0 for selecting a biomarker panel, traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) drug intervention for validating the close relations between the biomarker panel and the state and the receiver operating characteristic curves (ROC curves) analysis for evaluation of clinical diagnosis ability were carried out. 9 endogenous metabolites containing trimethylamine oxide (TMAO), glutamine, Nacetylglycoproteins, citrate, tyrosine, phenylalanine, isoleucine, valine and glucose were identified and considered as potential biomarkers. Then a biomarker panel consisting of phenylalanine, glutamine, tyrosine, citrate, Nacetylglycoproteins and TMAO was selected, which exhibited the highest area under the curve (AUC  0.971).

Here we show that an A. vinelandii strain expressing the Vnitrogenase is capable of in vivo reduction of CO to ethylene (C2H4), ethane (C2H6) and propane (C3H8). Moreover, we demonstrate that CO is not used as a carbon source for cell growth, being instead reduced to hydrocarbons in a secondary metabolic pathway. These findings suggest a possible role of the ancient nitrogenase as an evolutionary link between the carbon and nitrogen cycles on Earth and establish a solid foundation for biotechnological adaptation of a wholecell approach to recycling carbon wastes into hydrocarbon products. Thus, this study has several repercussions for evolution, environment and energyrelated areas. Nitrogenases reduce inorganic nitrogen to organic ammonia in a crucial step of the nitrogen cycle.

However, how the KDM4 family targets specific chromatin regions is largely unknown. Here, an extensive histone peptide microarray analysis uncovers trimethyllysine histonebinding preferences among the closely related KDM4 double tudor domains (DTDs). KDM4AB DTDs bind strongly to H3K23me3, a poorly understood histone modification recently shown to be enriched in meiotic chromatin of ciliates and nematodes. The 2.28 A cocrystal structure of KDM4ADTD in complex with H3K23me3 peptide reveals key intermolecular interactions for H3K23me3 recognition. Furthermore, analysis of the 2.56 A KDM4BDTD crystal structure pinpoints the underlying residues required for exclusive H3K23me3 specificity, an interaction supported by in vivo colocalization of KDM4B and H3K23me3 at heterochromatin in mammalian meiotic and newly postmeiotic spermatocytes. In vitro demethylation assays suggest H3K23me3 binding by KDM4B stimulates H3K36 demethylation. Together, these results provide a possible mechanism whereby H3K23me3binding by KDM4B directs localized H3K36 demethylation during meiosis and spermatogenesis. KDM4 histone demethylases target specific chromatin regions by a mechanism that is not fully characterised.

To capture the real complexity of such dynamics, we propose a novel model of the coevolution of epidemic and awareness spreading processes on a multiplex network, also introducing a preventive isolation strategy. Our aim is to evaluate and quantify the joint impact of heterogeneity and awareness, under different socioeconomic conditions. Considering, as case study, an emerging public health threat, Zika virus, we introduce a datadriven analysis by exploiting multiple sources and different types of data, ranging from Big Five personality traits to Google Trends, related to different world countries where there is an ongoing epidemic outbreak. Our findings demonstrate how the proposed model allows delaying the epidemic outbreak and increasing the resilience of nodes, especially under critical economic conditions.

Classical analysis of nuclear entry of heterogeneous viral particles only yields averaged information. We now have employed singlevirus fluorescence methods to follow the fate of single viral preintegration complexes (PICs) during infection by visualizing HIV1 integrase (IN). Nuclear entry is associated with a reduction in the number of IN molecules in the complexes while the interaction with LEDGFp75 enhances IN oligomerization in the nucleus. Addition of LEDGINs, small molecule inhibitors of the INLEDGFp75 interaction, during virus production, prematurely stabilizes a higherorder IN multimeric state, resulting in stable IN multimers resistant to a reduction in IN content and defective for nuclear entry. This suggests that a stringent size restriction determines nuclear pore entry.

e5bbe73abebb486e9279022f0e2cb96e,Spin canting across coreshell Fe 3 O 4 Mn x Fe 3x O 4 nanoparticles,"Magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) have become increasingly important in biomedical applications like magnetic imaging and hyperthermia based cancer treatment. Understanding their magnetic spin configurations is important for optimizing these applications. The measured magnetization of MNPs can be significantly lower than bulk counterparts, often due to canted spins. This has previously been presumed to be a surface effect, where reduced exchange allows spins closest to the nanoparticle surface to deviate locally from collinear structures. We demonstrate that intraparticle effects can induce spin canting throughout a MNP via the DzyaloshinskiiMoriya interaction (DMI). We study ~7.4 nm diameter, coreshell Fe3O4MnxFe3xO4 MNPs with a 0.5 nm Mnferrite shell. Mossbauer spectroscopy, xray absorption spectroscopy and xray magnetic circular dichroism are used to determine chemical structure of core and shell. Polarized small angle neutron scattering shows parallel and perpendicular magnetic correlations, suggesting multiparticle coherent spin canting in an applied field. Atomistic simulations reveal the underlying mechanism of the observed spin canting. These show that strong DMI can lead to magnetic frustration within the shell and cause canting of the net particle moment. These results illuminate how coreshell nanoparticle systems can be engineered for spin canting across the whole of the particle, rather than solely at the surface.",Samuel D.

However, commonly used tinbased narrowbandgap perovskites have shorter carrier diffusion lengths and lower absorption coefficient than leadbased perovskites, limiting the efficiency of perovskiteperovskite tandem solar cells. In this work, we discover that the charge collection efficiency in tinbased PSCs is limited by a short diffusion length of electrons. Adding 0.03 molar percent of cadmium ions into tinperovskite precursors reduce the background free hole concentration and electron trap density, yielding a long electron diffusion length of 2.72  0.15 m. It increases the optimized thickness of narrowbandgap perovskite films to 1000 nm, yielding exceptional stabilized efficiencies of 20.2 and 22.7% for single junction narrowbandgap PSCs and monolithic perovskiteperovskite tandem cells, respectively. This work provides a promising method to enhance the optoelectronic properties of narrowbandgap perovskites and unleash the potential of perovskiteperovskite tandem solar cells.

8a8ce61b59f545848fe5582df060cae3,Discovery of a potent HMGCoA reductase degrader that eliminates statininduced reductase accumulation and lowers cholesterol,"Statins are inhibitors of HMGCoA reductase, the ratelimiting enzyme of cholesterol biosynthesis, and have been clinically used to treat cardiovascular disease. However, a paradoxical increase of reductase protein following statin treatment may attenuate the effect and increase the side effects. Here we present a previously unexplored strategy to alleviate statininduced reductase accumulation by inducing its degradation. Inspired by the observations that cholesterol intermediates trigger reductase degradation, we identify a potent degrader, namely Cmpd 81, through structureactivity relationship analysis of sterol analogs. Cmpd 81 stimulates ubiquitination and degradation of reductase in an Insigdependent manner, thus dramatically reducing protein accumulation induced by various statins. Cmpd 81 can act alone or synergistically with statin to lower cholesterol and reduce atherosclerotic plaques in mice. Collectively, our work suggests that inducing reductase degradation by Cmpd 81 or similar chemicals alone or in combination with statin therapy can be a promising strategy for treating cardiovascular disease. Accumulated HMGCoA reductase (HMGCR) limits the cholesterollowering effect of statins via a feedback loop. Here the authors developed a compound that degrades HMGCR, thus decreasing cholesterol levels and reducing atherosclerotic plaques.",ShiYou Jiang; Hui Li; JingJie Tang; Jie Wang; Jie Luo; Bing Liu; JinKai Wang; XiongJie Shi; HaiWei Cui; Jie Tang; Fan Yang; Wei Qi; WenWei Qiu; BaoLiang Song,Dyslipidaemias; Sterols; Ubiquitylated proteins,"Hubei Key Laboratory of Cell Homeostasis, College of Life Sciences, Institute for Advanced Studies, Wuhan University, Wuhan, China; Shanghai Engineering Research Center of Molecular Therapeutics and New Drug Development, School of Chemistry and Molecular Engineering, East China Normal University, Shanghai, China; State Key Laboratory of Molecular Biology, Institute of Biochemistry and Cell Biology, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai, China; Shanghai Engineering Research Center of Molecular Therapeutics and New Drug Development, School of Chemistry and Molecular Engineering, East China Normal University, Shanghai, China; Hubei Key Laboratory of Cell Homeostasis, College of Life Sciences, Institute for Advanced Studies, Wuhan University, Wuhan, China; Shanghai Engineering Research Center of Molecular Therapeutics and New Drug Development, School of Chemistry and Molecular Engineering, East China Normal University, Shanghai, China; Hubei Key Laboratory of Cell Homeostasis, College of Life Sciences, Institute for Advanced Studies, Wuhan University, Wuhan, China; Hubei Key Laboratory of Cell Homeostasis, College of Life Sciences, Institute for Advanced Studies, Wuhan University, Wuhan, China; Shanghai Engineering Research Center of Molecular Therapeutics and New Drug Development, School of Chemistry and Molecular Engineering, East China Normal University, Shanghai, China; Shanghai Engineering Research Center of Molecular Therapeutics and New Drug Development, School of Chemistry and Molecular Engineering, East China Normal University, Shanghai, China; Shanghai Engineering Research Center of Molecular Therapeutics and New Drug Development, School of Chemistry and Molecular Engineering, East China Normal University, Shanghai, China; School of Life Science and Technology, ShanghaiTech University, Shanghai, China; Shanghai Engineering Research Center of Molecular Therapeutics and New Drug Development, School of Chemistry and Molecular Engineering, East China Normal University, Shanghai, China; Hubei Key Laboratory of Cell Homeostasis, College of Life Sciences, Institute for Advanced Studies, Wuhan University, Wuhan, China"

Here we focus on the antenna complex peridininchlorophyll aprotein (PCP), known for its remarkable efficiency of excitation energy transfer from carotenoidsperidininsto chlorophylls. PCP solutions are studied by means of 2D electronic spectroscopy in different experimental conditions. Together with a global kinetic analysis and multiscale quantum chemical calculations, these data allow us to comprehensively address the contribution of the potential pathways of energy flow in PCP.

The purpose of this study was to assess whether a potentially autologous endothelial cell (EC) source derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCECs) can form the same robust, stable microvasculature as previously documented for other sources of ECs. We utilized a wellestablished in vitro assay, in which endothelial cellcoated (iPSCEC or HUVEC) beads were coembedded with fibroblasts in a 3D fibrin matrix to assess their ability to form stable microvessels. iPSCECs exhibited a fivefold reduction in capillary network formation compared to HUVECs. Increasing matrix density reduced sprouting, although this effect was attenuated by distributing the NHLFs throughout the matrix. Inhibition of both MMP and plasminmediated fibrinolysis was required to completely block sprouting of both HUVECs and iPSCECs. Further analysis revealed MMP9 expression and activity were significantly lower in iPSCECNHLF cocultures than in HUVECNHLF cocultures at later time points, which may account for the observed deficiencies in angiogenic sprouting of the iPSCECs. Collectively, these findings suggest fundamental differences in EC phenotypes must be better understood to enable the promise and potential of iPSCECs for clinical translation to be realized.",Jonathan R.

Development of AD follows a distinctive pattern in the brain and is poorly modelled in animals. Therefore, it is vital to widen the spatial scope of the study of AD and prioritise the study of human brains. Here we show that functionally distinct human brain regions display varying and regionspecific changes in protein expression. These changes provide insights into the progression of disease, novel ADrelated pathways, the presence of a gradient of protein expression change from less to more affected regions and a possibly protective protein expression profile in the cerebellum. This spatial proteomics analysis provides a framework which can underpin current research and open new avenues to enhance molecular understanding of AD pathophysiology, provide new targets for intervention and broaden the conceptual frameworks for future AD research.

Using the archetypal MSC in vitro surface marker, CD90Thy1, here we show that 30% of the MSCs in the continuously growing mouse incisor express CD90Thy1 and these cells give rise to 30% of the differentiated cell progeny during postnatal development. In adulthood, when growth rate homeostasis is established, the CD90Thy1 MSCs decrease dramatically in number. When adult incisors are cut, the growth rate increases to rapidly reestablish tooth length and homeostasis. This accelerated growth rate correlates with the reappearance of CD90Thy MSCs and reestablishment of their contribution to cell differentiation. A population of Celsr1 quiescent cells becomes mitotic following clipping and replenishes the CD90Thy1 population. A subpopulation of MSCs thus exists in the mouse incisor, distinguished by expression of CD90Thy1 that plays a specific role only during periods of increased growth rate. Mouse incisors constantly renew from a slow cycling population of mesenchymal stem cells. Here, the authors show that upon cutting of adult incisors, a subpopulation of dental mesenchymal stem cells reactivates, allowing an increased growth rate and rapid regeneration.",Zhengwen An; Maja Sabalic; Ryan F.

5282b9947d1a4a92ad4910de47ce2080,Identification of vacuolar phosphate efflux transporters in land plants,"Inorganic phosphate (Pi) is an essential component of all life forms. Land plants acquire Pi from the soil through roots and associated symbioses, and it is then transported throughout the plant. When sufficient, excess Pi is stored in vacuoles for remobilization following Pi deficiency. Although Pi release from the vacuoles to the cytoplasm serves as a critical mechanism for plants to adapt to lowPi stress, the transporters responsible for vacuolar Pi efflux have not been identified. Here, we identified a pair of Oryza sativa vacuolar Pi efflux transporters (OsVPE1 and OsVPE2) that were more abundant in plants grown under Pideficient conditions. These OsVPE proteins can transport Pi into yeast cells and Xenopus laevis oocytes. Vacuolar Pi content was higher in the lossoffunction Osvpe1 Osvpe2 double mutant than in wild type, particularly under lowPi stress. Overexpression of either OsVPE1 or OsVPE2 in transgenic plants reduced vacuolar Pi content, consistent with a role in vacuolar Pi efflux. We demonstrate that these VPE proteins evolved from an ancient plasma membrane glycerol3phosphate transporter protein. Together, these data indicate that this transporter was recruited to the vacuolar membrane to catalyse Pi efflux during the course of land plant evolution. Phosphorus is one of the essential nutrients for all living organisms. Plants and fungi store phosphate in their vacuoles. Multiple plant influx transporters have been reported to import phosphate to the vacuoles. Now, two new phosphate efflux transporters are shown to be important for phosphate export from the vacuole in rice and probably other land plants.",Lei Xu; Hongyu Zhao; Renjing Wan; Yu Liu; Zhuang Xu; Wang Tian; Wenyuan Ruan; Fang Wang; Minjuan Deng; Junmin Wang; Liam Dolan; Sheng Luan; Shaowu Xue; Keke Yi,Abiotic; Plant physiology,"Key Laboratory of Plant Nutrition and Fertilizers, Ministry of Agriculture, Institute of Agricultural Resources and Regional Planning, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Beijing, China; Key Laboratory of Plant Nutrition and Fertilizers, Ministry of Agriculture, Institute of Agricultural Resources and Regional Planning, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Beijing, China; College of Life Science and Technology, Huazhong Agricultural University, Wuhan, China; College of Life Sciences, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China; College of Life Science and Technology, Huazhong Agricultural University, Wuhan, China; Department of Plant and Microbial Biology, University of California, Berkeley, USA; Key Laboratory of Plant Nutrition and Fertilizers, Ministry of Agriculture, Institute of Agricultural Resources and Regional Planning, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Beijing, China; Zhejiang Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Hangzhou, China; Zhejiang Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Hangzhou, China; Zhejiang Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Hangzhou, China; Department of Plant Sciences, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK; Department of Plant and Microbial Biology, University of California, Berkeley, USA; College of Life Science and Technology, Huazhong Agricultural University, Wuhan, China; Key Laboratory of Plant Nutrition and Fertilizers, Ministry of Agriculture, Institute of Agricultural Resources and Regional Planning, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Beijing, China"
de74c268a5b64f0cbae27ac8814a351d,"Biomolecular regulation, composition and nanoarchitecture of bone mineral","Tough natural nanocomposites like bone, nacre and sea sponges contain within their hierarchy, a mineral (phosphate, silicate or carbonate) phase that interacts with an organic phase. In bone, the role of mineral ultrastructure (organization, morphology, composition) is crucial to the mechanical and biological properties of the tissue. Better understanding of mineral interaction with the organic matrix, in particular noncollagenous proteins, osteocalcin (OC) and osteopontin (OPN), can lead to better design of biomimetic materials. Using small angle xray scattering (SAXS) and wavelength dispersive spectroscopy (WDS) on single (OC and OPN) and double (OCOPN;) genetic knockout mice bones, we demonstrate that both osteocalcin and osteopontin have specific roles in the biomolecular regulation of mineral in bone and together they are major determinants of the quality of bone mineral. Specifically, for the first time, we show that proteins osteocalcin and osteopontin regulate bone mineral crystal size and organization in a codependent manner, while they independently determine crystal shape. We found that OC is more dominant in the regulation of the physical properties of bone mineral, while OPN is more dominant in the regulation of the mineral composition.",Atharva A.

Here we report on the pulsed laser deposition and characterization of thin films of a representative pyrochlore compound Bi2Ir2O7. The films were epitaxially grown on yttriastabilized zirconia substrates and have lattice constants that are a few percent larger than that of the bulk single crystals. The film composition shows a strong dependence on the oxygen partial pressure. Densityfunctionaltheory calculations indicate the existence of BiIr antisite defects, qualitatively consistent with the high Bi: Ir ratio found in the films. Both Ir and Bi have oxidation states that are lower than their nominal values, suggesting the existence of oxygen deficiency. The iridate thin films show a variety of intriguing transport characteristics, including multiple charge carriers, logarithmic dependence of resistance on temperature, antilocalization corrections to conductance due to spinorbit interactions, and linear positive magnetoresistance.",W.

Subsequent instantaneous quenching in water allows preserving the microstructures obtained at various stages of crystallization. One Zrbased and two CuZrbased BMGs were flashannealed at the onset of crystallization with different heating rates in order to prepare advanced BMGmatrix composites. The highly reproducible composite microstructures contain uniformly dispersed crystals and a narrow crystal size distribution. In order to assess the limitations of the present process, which mainly originate from nonuniform inductive heating, the skin depth was calculated. It is determined to be about 2.3 mm, which enables flashannealing of rather bulky samples. The cooling rate was estimated from the interlamellar spacing of eutectic AlCu alloys to be on the order of 103 Ks. This ensures that decomposition of the microstructure during quenching is prevented. The present flashannealing procedure is applicable to a wide variety of glassforming liquids and has a large potential for tailoring the microstructure and, consequently, the mechanical properties of BMGmatrix composites.",K.

Ribosomeassociated J proteinHsp70 chaperones promote nascentpolypeptide folding and normal translational fidelity. The J protein Zuo1 is known to span the ribosomal subunits, but understanding of its function is limited. Here we present new structural and crosslinking data allowing more precise positioning of Saccharomyces cerevisiae Zuo1 near the 60S polypeptideexit site and suggesting interactions of Zuo1 with the ribosomal protein eL31 and 25S rRNA helix 24. The junction between the 60Sinteracting and subunitspanning helices is a hinge that positions Zuo1 on the 40S yet accommodates subunit rotation. Interaction between the Zuo1 C terminus and 40S occurs via 18S rRNA expansion segment 12 (ES12) of helix 44, which originates at the decoding site. Deletions in either ES12 or the Zuo1 C terminus alter readthrough of stop codons and 1 frameshifting. Our study offers insight into how this cotranslational chaperone system may monitor decodingsite activity and nascentpolypeptide transit, thereby coordinating protein translation and folding.",Kanghyun Lee; Ruchika Sharma; Om Kumar Shrestha; Craig A Bingman; Elizabeth A Craig,Chaperones; Xray crystallography,"Department of Biochemistry, University of WisconsinMadison, Madison, USA; Department of Biochemistry, University of WisconsinMadison, Madison, USA; Department of Biochemistry, University of WisconsinMadison, Madison, USA; Present address: Cold Spring Harbor Laboratories, Cold Spring Harbor, New York, USA.,

9f9d8eef43674f1ab354f3c769ea523c,Highfidelity selfassembly pathways for hydrogenbonding molecular semiconductors,"The design of molecular systems with highfidelity selfassembly pathways that include several levels of hierarchy is of primary importance for the understanding of structurefunction relationships, as well as for controlling the functionality of organic materials. Reported herein is a highfidelity selfassembly system that comprises two hydrogenbonding molecular semiconductors with regioisomerically attached short alkyl chains. Despite the availability of both discrete cyclic and polymeric linear hydrogenbonding motifs, the two regioisomers select one of the two motifs in homogeneous solution as well as at the 2Dconfined liquidsolid interface. This selectivity arises from the high directionality of the involved hydrogenbonding interactions, which renders rerouting to other selfassembly pathways difficult. In thin films and in the bulk, the resulting hydrogenbonded assemblies further organize into the expected columnar and lamellar higherorder architectures via solution processing. The contrasting organized structures of these regioisomers are reflected in their notably different miscibility with soluble fullerene derivatives in the solid state. Thus, electron donoracceptor blend films deliver a distinctly different photovoltaic performance, despite their virtually identical intrinsic optoelectronic properties. Currently, we attribute this highfidelity control via selfassembly pathways to the molecular design of these supramolecular semiconductors, which lacks structuredetermining long aliphatic chains.",Xu Lin; Mika Suzuki; Marina Gushiken; Mitsuaki Yamauchi; Takashi Karatsu; Takahiro Kizaki; Yuki Tani; Kenichi Nakayama; Mitsuharu Suzuki; Hiroko Yamada; Takashi Kajitani; Takanori Fukushima; Yoshihiro Kikkawa; Shiki Yagai,Selfassembly,"Graduate School of Engineering, Chiba University, Inageku, Japan; Graduate School of Engineering, Chiba University, Inageku, Japan; Graduate School of Engineering, Chiba University, Inageku, Japan; Graduate School of Engineering, Chiba University, Inageku, Japan; Graduate School of Engineering, Chiba University, Inageku, Japan; Graduate School of Science and Engineering, Yamagata University, Yonezawa, Japan; Graduate School of Science and Engineering, Yamagata University, Yonezawa, Japan; Graduate School of Engineering, Osaka University, Suita, Japan; Graduate School of Material Science, Nara Institute of Science and Technology (NAIST), Ikoma, Japan; Graduate School of Material Science, Nara Institute of Science and Technology (NAIST), Ikoma, Japan; Laboratory for Chemistry and Life Science, Institute of Innovative Research, Tokyo Institute of Technology, Midoriku, Japan; RIKEN SPring8 Center, Sayo, Japan; Laboratory for Chemistry and Life Science, Institute of Innovative Research, Tokyo Institute of Technology, Midoriku, Japan; National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology (AIST), Tsukuba, Japan; Graduate School of Engineering, Chiba University, Inageku, Japan"
11f9e91b92394b01a5b9a2e1b545f1df,Activitydependent plasticity of hippocampal place maps,"Hippocampal neurons encode a cognitive map of space. These maps are thought to be updated during learning and in response to changes in the environment through activitydependent synaptic plasticity. Here we examine how changes in activity influence spatial coding in rats using halorhodopsinmediated, spatially selective optogenetic silencing. Halorhoposin stimulation leads to lightinduced suppression in many place cells and interneurons; some place cells increase their firing through disinhibition, whereas some show no effect. We find that place fields of the unaffected subpopulation remain stable. On the other hand, place fields of suppressed place cells were unstable, showing remapping across sessions before and after optogenetic inhibition. Disinhibited place cells had stable maps but sustained an elevated firing rate. These findings suggest that place representation in the hippocampus is constantly governed by activitydependent processes, and that disinhibition may provide a mechanism for rate remapping. Place cells in hippocampus encode a map of space, however the role of activity in place map stability is not known. Schoenenberger and colleagues optogenetically manipulate hippocampal firing rates within place fields and show lasting changes in spatial firing patterns through two separate mechanisms.

Here we report a metaanalysis of 11 nevus GWAS from Australia, Netherlands, UK, and USA comprising 52,506 individuals. We confirm known loci including MTAP, PLA2G6, and IRF4, and detect novel SNPs in KITLG and a region of 9q32. In a bivariate analysis combining the nevus results with a recent melanoma GWAS metaanalysis (12,874 cases, 23,203 controls), SNPs near GPRC5A, CYP1B1, PPARGC1B, HDAC4, FAM208B, DOCK8, and SYNE2 reached global significance, and other loci, including MIR146A and OBFC1, reached a suggestive level. Overall, we conclude that most nevus genes affect melanoma risk (KITLG an exception), while many melanoma risk loci do not alter nevus count. For example, variants in TERC and OBFC1 affect both traits, but other telomere length maintenance genes seem to affect melanoma risk only. Our findings implicate multiple pathways in nevogenesis. Melanocytic nevus count is associated with melanoma risk. In this study, a metaanalysis of 11 nevus GWAS studies identifies novel SNPs in KITLG and 9q32, and bivariate analysis with melanoma GWAS metaanalysis reveals that most nevus genes affect melanoma risk, while melanoma risk loci do not alter the nevus count.",David L.

Being earthabundant, lowcost and nontoxic, elemental Si is a very attractive candidate for this process, which targets CO2 conversion to synthetic fuels on a gigatonneperyear scale. It is well known, however, that silicon hydrides react stoichiometrically with CO2, and all attempts have failed to achieve catalytic conversion. The problem originates from the formation of inactive silanols and siloxanes with permanent loss of Si hydrides. Here, we deposit Pd on the surface of Si nanosheets, aiming to address the core of the problem. An operando infrared study shows Si hydrides successfully regenerating on such surfaces exposed to CO2 and H2. We demonstrate that siliconhydride nanosheets decorated with Pd nanoparticles can enable the reverse watergas shift reaction in a catalytic cycle. Siliconhydride materials are attractive candidates for the photoreduction of carbon dioxide into fuels, although they have only worked stoichiometrically so far. Now, Ozin and coworkers show how decorating silicon nanosheets with palladium nanoparticles renders the process catalytic.

Suppressing any such distortions of a wave's free propagation is a challenging task with many applications in a number of different disciplines. In a recent theoretical proposal, it was pointed out that both perfect transmission through disorder as well as a complete suppression of any variation in a wave's intensity can be achieved by adding a continuous gainloss distribution to the disorder. Here we propose a practical discretized version of this abstract concept and implement it in a realistic acoustic system. Our prototype consists of an acoustic waveguide containing several inclusions that scatter the incoming wave in a passive configuration and provide the gain or loss when being actively controlled. Our measurements on this nonHermitian acoustic metamaterial demonstrate the creation of a reflectionless scattering wave state that features a unique form of discrete constantamplitude pressure waves. In addition to demonstrating that gainloss additions can turn localized systems into transparent ones, we expect our proofofprinciple demonstration to trigger interesting new developments, not only in sound engineering, but also in other related fields such as in nonHermitian photonics. Perfect transmission of sound waves through a strongly disordered environment is demonstrated using a set of speakers that provide exactly the right input to counteract scattering by the disorder. These principles can also be applied to light.",Etienne Rivet; Andre Brandstotter; Konstantinos G.

These grain boundaries can dominate the overall (opto)electronic properties of the entire device and their exact morphological and energetic nature is still under current debate. Here, we explore in detail the energetics at the grain boundaries of a novel electron conductive perylene diimide thin film. Via a combination of temperature dependent charge transport measurements and abinitio simulations at atomistic resolution, we identify that energetic barriers at grain boundaries dominate charge transport in our system. This novel aspect of physics at the grain boundary is distinct from previously identified grainboundary defects that had been explained by trapping of charges.

da7296b41fbd4342968b8e7d392061a8,A smartphone app to reduce excessive alcohol consumption: Identifying the effectiveness of intervention components in a factorial randomised control trial,"Our aim was to evaluate intervention components of an alcohol reduction app: Drink Less. Excessive drinkers (AUDIT 8) were recruited to test enhanced versus minimal (reduced functionality) versions of five app modules in a 25 factorial trial. Modules were: Selfmonitoring and Feedback, Action Planning, Identity Change, Normative Feedback, and Cognitive Bias Retraining. Outcome measures were: change in weekly alcohol consumption (primary); full AUDIT score, app usage, app usability (secondary). Main effects and twoway interactions were assessed by ANOVA using intentiontotreat. A total of 672 study participants were included. There were no significant main effects of the intervention modules on change in weekly alcohol consumption or AUDIT score. There were twoway interactions between enhanced Normative Feedback and Cognitive Bias Retraining on weekly alcohol consumption (F  4.68, p  0.03) and between enhanced Selfmonitoring and Feedback and Action Planning on AUDIT score (F  5.82, p  0.02). Enhanced Selfmonitoring and Feedback was used significantly more often and rated significantly more positively for helpfulness, satisfaction and recommendation to others than the minimal version. To conclude, in an evaluation of the Drink Less smartphone application, the combination of enhanced Normative Feedback and Cognitive Bias Retraining and enhanced Selfmonitoring and Feedback and Action Planning yielded improvements in alcoholrelated outcomes after 4weeks.",David Crane; Claire Garnett; Susan Michie; Robert West; Jamie Brown,Lifestyle modification; Population screening,"Department of Clinical, Educational and Health Psychology, University College London, London, UK; Department of Clinical, Educational and Health Psychology, University College London, London, UK; Department of Behavioural Science and Health, University College London, London, UK; Department of Clinical, Educational and Health Psychology, University College London, London, UK; Department of Behavioural Science and Health, University College London, London, UK; Department of Clinical, Educational and Health Psychology, University College London, London, UK; Department of Behavioural Science and Health, University College London, London, UK"

However, the effects of a threedimensional (3D) environment on direct neuronal reprogramming remain unexplored. Here, we show that brain extracellular matrix (BEM) decellularized from human brain tissue facilitates the plasmidtransfectionbased direct conversion of primary mouse embryonic fibroblasts into induced neuronal (iN) cells. We first show that twodimensional (2D) surfaces modified with BEM significantly increase the generation efficiency of iN cells and enhance neuronal transdifferentiation and maturation. Moreover, in an animal model of ischaemic stroke, iN cells generated on the BEM substrates and transplanted into the brain led to significant improvements in locomotive behaviours. We also show that compared with the 2D BEM substrates, 3D BEM hydrogels recapitulating brainlike microenvironments further promote neuronal conversion and potentiate the functional recovery of the animals. Our findings suggest that 3D microenvironments can boost nonviral direct reprogramming for the generation of therapeutic neuronal cells. Hydrogels made from decellularized human brain tissue facilitate the direct conversion of primary mouse embryonic fibroblasts into induced neuronal cells that lead to therapeutic outcomes after transplantation in an animal model of ischaemic stroke.",Yoonhee Jin; Jung Seung Lee; Jin Kim; Sungjin Min; Soohyun Wi; Ji Hea Yu; GyeongEon Chang; AnnNa Cho; Yeeun Choi; DaHee Ahn; SungRae Cho; Eunji Cheong; YunGon Kim; HyongPyo Kim; Yonghwan Kim; Dong Seok Kim; Hyun Woo Kim; Zhejiu Quan; HoonChul Kang; SeungWoo Cho,Bioinspired materials; Biomedical engineering; Biophysics; Reprogramming; Transdifferentiation,"Department of Biotechnology, Yonsei University, Seoul, Republic of Korea; Department of Biotechnology, Yonsei University, Seoul, Republic of Korea; Department of Biotechnology, Yonsei University, Seoul, Republic of Korea; Department of Biotechnology, Yonsei University, Seoul, Republic of Korea; Department and Research Institute of Rehabilitation Medicine, Yonsei University College of Medicine, Seoul, Republic of Korea; Brain Korea 21 PLUS Project for Medical Science, Yonsei University College of Medicine, Seoul, Republic of Korea; Department and Research Institute of Rehabilitation Medicine, Yonsei University College of Medicine, Seoul, Republic of Korea; Department of Biotechnology, Yonsei University, Seoul, Republic of Korea; Department of Biotechnology, Yonsei University, Seoul, Republic of Korea; Brain Korea 21 PLUS Project for Medical Science, Yonsei University College of Medicine, Seoul, Republic of Korea; Department of Environmental Medical Biology, Yonsei University College of Medicine, Seoul, Republic of Korea; Department of Chemical Engineering, Soongsil University, Seoul, Republic of Korea; Department and Research Institute of Rehabilitation Medicine, Yonsei University College of Medicine, Seoul, Republic of Korea; Brain Korea 21 PLUS Project for Medical Science, Yonsei University College of Medicine, Seoul, Republic of Korea; Department of Biotechnology, Yonsei University, Seoul, Republic of Korea; Department of Chemical Engineering, Soongsil University, Seoul, Republic of Korea; Brain Korea 21 PLUS Project for Medical Science, Yonsei University College of Medicine, Seoul, Republic of Korea; Department of Environmental Medical Biology, Yonsei University College of Medicine, Seoul, Republic of Korea; Division of Biological Sciences, Sookmyung Women's University, Seoul, Republic of Korea; Division of Pediatric Neurosurgery, Severance Children's Hospital, Department of Neurosurgery, Yonsei University College of Medicine, Seoul, Republic of Korea; Division of Pediatric Neurology, Department of Pediatrics, Yonsei University College of Medicine, Seoul, Republic of Korea; Division of Pediatric Neurology, Department of Pediatrics, Yonsei University College of Medicine, Seoul, Republic of Korea; Division of Pediatric Neurology, Department of Pediatrics, Yonsei University College of Medicine, Seoul, Republic of Korea; Department of Biotechnology, Yonsei University, Seoul, Republic of Korea; Center for Nanomedicine, Institute for Basic Science (IBS), Seoul, Republic of Korea"

In this study 16S rRNA gene amplicon, shotgun metagenomics sequencing and antibiotic resistance (ABR) microarray were used on fecal samples of 70 healthy participants, taken at four time points in probiotic (Lactobacillus rhamnosus R0011 and Lactobacillus helveticus R0052) and placebo groups to profile the gut bacterial microbiota and its resistome following administration of amoxicillinclavulanic acid for one week. Significant shifts in microbiota family composition caused by the antimicrobial in both groups that included decreases in the proportion of Lachnospiraceae, Coriobacteriaceae and unidentified Clostridiales; and notable increases for the proportion of Enterobacteriaceae, Bacteroidaceae and Porphyromonadaceae compared to baseline levels. Resistome showed a corresponding enrichment of ABR genes compared to baseline from such classes as aminoglycosides and betalactams that were linked, by in silico inference, to the enrichment of the family Enterobacteriaceae. Despite perturbations caused by shortterm antibiotic treatment, both gut microbiota and resistome showed prompt recovery to baseline levels one week after cessation of the antimicrobial.

However, the anatomical and neural circuitry underlying these behaviors are unknown. We generated mice with Shank3 selectively deleted in forebrain, striatum, and striatal D1 and D2 cells. These mice were used to interrogate the circuitbrainregion and celltype specific role of Shank3 in the expression of autismrelated behaviors. Wholecell patch recording and biochemical analyses were used to study the synaptic function and molecular changes in specific brain regions. We found perseverative exploratory behaviors in mice with deletion of Shank3 in striatal inhibitory neurons. Conversely, selfgrooming induced lesions were observed in mice with deletion of Shank3 in excitatory neurons of forebrain. However, social, communicative, and instrumental learning behaviors were largely unaffected in these mice, unlike what is seen in global e422 mice. We discovered unique patterns of change for the biochemical and electrophysiological findings in respective brain regions that reflect the complex nature of transcriptional regulation of Shank3. Reductions in Homer1bc and membrane hyperexcitability were observed in striatal loss of Shank3. By comparison, Shank3 deletion in hippocampal neurons resulted in increased NMDARcurrents and GluN2Bcontaining NMDARs. These results together suggest that Shank3 may differentially regulate neural circuits that control behavior. Our study supports a dissociation of Shank3 functions in cortical and striatal neurons in ASDrelated behaviors, and it illustrates the complexity of neural circuit mechanisms underlying these behaviors.",Alexandra L.

They may have had an important role in the colonization of land by eukaryotes, and in the appearance and success of land plants and metazoans13. Nevertheless, fossils that can unambiguously be identified as fungi are absent from the fossil record until the middle of the Palaeozoic era4,5. Here we show, using morphological, ultrastructural and spectroscopic analyses, that multicellular organicwalled microfossils preserved in shale of the Grassy Bay Formation (Shaler Supergroup, Arctic Canada), which dates to approximately 1,010890 million years ago, have a fungal affinity. These microfossils are more than half a billion years older than previously reported unambiguous occurrences of fungi, a date which is consistent with data from molecular clocks for the emergence of this clade6,7. In extending the fossil record of the fungi, this finding also pushes back the minimum date for the appearance of eukaryotic crown group Opisthokonta, which comprises metazoans, fungi and their protist relatives8,9.

Information is not readily available in a form suitable for policy and reporting. The Global Register of Introduced and Invasive Species (GRIIS) provides the first countrywise checklists of introduced (naturalised) and invasive species. GRIIS was conceived to provide a sustainable platform for information delivery to support national governments. We outline the rationale and methods underpinning GRIIS, to facilitate transparent, repeatable analysis and reporting. Twenty country checklists are presented as exemplars; GRIIS Checklists for close to all countries globally will be submitted through the same process shortly. Over 11000 species records are currently in the 20 country exemplars alone, with environmental impact evidence for just over 20% of these. GRIIS provides significant support for countries to identify and prioritise invasive alien species, and establishes national and global baselines. In future this will enable a global system for sustainable monitoring of trends in biological invasions that affect the environment.

Furthermore, the transient expression system can be used to identify the localization of proteins in plant cells. In this study, we demonstrated that combination of a geminiviral replication and a double terminator dramatically enhanced the transient protein expression level in plants. The GFP protein was expressed transiently in lettuce, Nicotiana benthamiana, tomatoes, eggplants, hot peppers, melons, and orchids with agroinfiltration. Compared to a single terminator, a double terminator enhanced the expression level. A heat shock protein terminator combined with an extensin terminator resulted in the highest protein expression. Transiently expressed GFP was confirmed by immunoblot analysis with antiGFP antibodies. Quantitative analysis revealed that the geminiviral vector with a double terminator resulted in the expression of at least 3.7 mgg fresh weight of GFP in Nicotiana benthamiana, approximately 2fold that of the geminiviral vector with a single terminator. These results indicated that combination of the geminiviral replication and a double terminator is a useful tool for transient expression of the gene of interest in plant cells.",Tsuyoshi Yamamoto; Ken Hoshikawa; Kentaro Ezura; Risa Okazawa; Satoshi Fujita; Miyo Takaoka; Hugh S.

ce67eeff489a4f30a29e70f6cb714f0e,Quantumcoherent mixtures of causal relations,"Understanding the causal influences that hold among parts of a system is critical both to explaining that system's natural behaviour and to controlling it through targeted interventions. In a quantum world, understanding causal relations is equally important, but the set of possibilities is far richer. The two basic ways in which a pair of timeordered quantum systems may be causally related are by a causeeffect mechanism or by a commoncause acting on both. Here we show a coherent mixture of these two possibilities. We realize this nonclassical causal relation in a quantum optics experiment and derive a set of criteria for witnessing the coherence based on a quantum version of Berkson's effect, whereby two independent causes can become correlated on observation of their common effect. The interplay of causality and quantum theory lies at the heart of challenging foundational puzzles, including Bell's theorem and the search for quantum gravity. The set of causal relations that can connect two systems is much richer in the quantum world. Here the authors show that it is possible to have a coherent mixture of a causeeffect and a commoncause mechanism between two systems, realizing this in a quantum optics experiment.",JeanPhilippe W.

In vitro reconstitution of the redox relay revealed a role for the Yap1binding protein Ybp1 in promoting the formation of a ternary complex with Orp1 and Yap1 to enable redox transfer.
                  
                    
                  
                 In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Yap1 regulates an H2O2inducible transcriptional response that controls cellular H2O2 homeostasis. H2O2 activates Yap1 by oxidation through the intermediary of the thiol peroxidase Orp1. Upon reacting with H2O2, Orp1 catalytic cysteine oxidizes to a sulfenic acid, which then engages into either an intermolecular disulfide with Yap1, leading to Yap1 activation, or an intramolecular disulfide that commits the enzyme into its peroxidatic cycle. How the first of these two competing reactions, which is kinetically unfavorable, occurs was previously unknown. We show that the Yap1binding protein Ybp1 brings together Orp1 and Yap1 into a ternary complex that selectively activates condensation of the Orp1 sulfenylated cysteine with one of the six Yap1 cysteines while inhibiting Orp1 intramolecular disulfide formation. We propose that Ybp1 operates as a scaffold protein and as a sulfenic acid chaperone to provide specificity in the transfer of oxidizing equivalents by a reactive sulfenic acid species.",Antoine Bersweiler; Benoit D'Autreaux; Hortense Mazon; Alexandre Kriznik; Gemma Belli; Agnes DelaunayMoisan; Michel B Toledano; Sophie RahuelClermont,Cell signalling; Enzyme mechanisms; Posttranslational modifications; Transcription factors,"UMR 7365 CNRSUniversite de Lorraine IMoPA, Biopole, Campus BiologieSante, VanduvrelesNancy, France; Institute for Integrative Biology of the Cell (I2BC), CNRS, CEASaclay, Universite ParisSaclay, iBiTecSSBIGEM, Laboratoire Stress Oxydant et Cancer, GifsurYvette, France; UMR 7365 CNRSUniversite de Lorraine IMoPA, Biopole, Campus BiologieSante, VanduvrelesNancy, France; UMR 7365 CNRSUniversite de Lorraine IMoPA, Biopole, Campus BiologieSante, VanduvrelesNancy, France; Institute for Integrative Biology of the Cell (I2BC), CNRS, CEASaclay, Universite ParisSaclay, iBiTecSSBIGEM, Laboratoire Stress Oxydant et Cancer, GifsurYvette, France; Department of Basic Medical Sciences, IRB Lleida, University of Lleida, Lleida, Spain; Institute for Integrative Biology of the Cell (I2BC), CNRS, CEASaclay, Universite ParisSaclay, iBiTecSSBIGEM, Laboratoire Stress Oxydant et Cancer, GifsurYvette, France; Institute for Integrative Biology of the Cell (I2BC), CNRS, CEASaclay, Universite ParisSaclay, iBiTecSSBIGEM, Laboratoire Stress Oxydant et Cancer, GifsurYvette, France; UMR 7365 CNRSUniversite de Lorraine IMoPA, Biopole, Campus BiologieSante, VanduvrelesNancy, France"
3f006422b835434d84c0171720e4156b,Insulin and TOR signal in parallel through FOXO and S6K to promote epithelial wound healing,"The TOR and InsulinIGF signalling (IIS) network controls growth, metabolism and ageing. Although reducing TOR or insulin signalling can be beneficial for ageing, it can be detrimental for wound healing, but the reasons for this difference are unknown. Here we show that IIS is activated in the cells surrounding an epidermal wound in Drosophila melanogaster larvae, resulting in PI3K activation and redistribution of the transcription factor FOXO. Insulin and TOR signalling are independently necessary for normal wound healing, with FOXO and S6K as their respective effectors. IIS is specifically required in cells surrounding the wound, and the effect is independent of glycogen metabolism. Insulin signalling is needed for the efficient assembly of an actomyosin cable around the wound, and constitutively active myosin II regulatory light chain suppresses the effects of reduced IIS. These findings may have implications for the role of insulin signalling and FOXO activation in diabetic wound healing. The TOR and insulinIGF signalling (IIS) network are central responses to wound healing. Here the authors develop a technique of live imaging of laserinduced epidermal wounds to flies and show that TOR and IIS are independently required for wound healing, which may have implications for diabetic wound healing and its treatment.

               Sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) is the leading cause of infant mortality in developed countries. In this Review, Behr and colleagues provide an update on the spectrum and prevalence of the subset of SIDS mediated by cardiogenetic factors, and the clinical implications of SIDS in the surviving family and general population. Sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) is the leading cause of postneonatal infant mortality in developed countries, characterized by the death of infants for no obvious reason and without prior warning. The complex interaction of multiple factors in the pathogenesis of SIDS is illustrated by the 'triple risk hypothesis', which proposed that SIDS results from a convergence of three overlapping risk factors: a critical developmental period, an exogenous stressor, and underlying genetic andor nongenetic vulnerability in the infant. Rare variants in genes associated with inherited arrhythmia syndromes and cardiomyopathies have been proposed as the substrate for an infant's critical vulnerability in a small subset of SIDS cases. Given the potential risk of inherited cardiac disease, current guidelines recommend postmortem genetic testing (molecular autopsy) and cardiological investigation of the surviving family, complemented by targeted genetic testing if appropriate. In this Review, we highlight the latest developments in understanding the spectrum and prevalence of cardiacmediated SIDS, and discuss the clinical implications of SIDS in the surviving family and the general population.",AlbanElouen Baruteau; David J.

d827f6cf4ef14062a41c2ce328541da1,"Pumping liquid metal at high temperatures up to 1,673 kelvin","Heat is fundamental to power generation and many industrial processes, and is most useful at high temperatures because it can be converted more efficiently to other types of energy. However, efficient transportation, storage and conversion of heat at extreme temperatures (more than about 1,300 kelvin) is impractical for many applications. Liquid metals can be very effective media for transferring heat at high temperatures, but liquidmetal pumping has been limited by the corrosion of metal infrastructures. Here we demonstrate a ceramic, mechanical pump that can be used to continuously circulate liquid tin at temperatures of around 1,4731,673 kelvin. Our approach to liquidmetal pumping is enabled by the use of ceramics for the mechanical and sealing components, but owing to the brittle nature of ceramics their use requires careful engineering. Our setup enables effective heat transfer using a liquid at previously unattainable temperatures, and could be used for thermal storage and transport, electric power production, and chemical or materials processing. By using ceramics for the mechanical and sealing components of a mechanical pump, liquid metal can be circulated continuously at temperatures at least as high as 1,673 kelvin. The ability to manipulate molten metals is not just of interest for materials processing: at extremely high temperatures a molten metal could become a medium for the efficient storage and transport of energy. But the high temperatures involved place severe limitations on the materials available for constructing a pumping apparatus. Caleb Amy et al. now show that usually brittle ceramics can, through careful engineering, be used to construct the mechanical and sealing components of a molten metal pump that is capable of continuous operation at temperatures up to a record 1,673 kelvin (1,400 degrees Celsius).",C.

                 Epoxides are highly useful synthons and biosynthons for the construction of complex natural products during total synthesis and biosynthesis, respectively. Among enzymecatalyzed epoxide transformations, a reaction that is notably missing, in regard to the synthetic toolbox, is cationic rearrangement that takes place under strong acid. This is a challenging transformation for enzyme catalysis, as stabilization of the carbocation intermediate upon epoxide cleavage is required. Here, we discovered two Brnsted acid enzymes that can catalyze two unprecedented epoxide transformations in biology. PenF from the penigequinolone pathway catalyzes a cationic epoxide rearrangement under physiological conditions to generate a quaternary carbon center, while AsqO from the aspoquinolone pathway catalyzes a 3exotet cyclization to forge a cyclopropanetetrahydrofuran ring system. The discovery of these new epoxidemodifying enzymes further highlights the versatility of epoxides in complexity generation during natural product biosynthesis.",Yi Zou; Marc GarciaBorras; Mancheng C Tang; Yuichiro Hirayama; Dehai H Li; Li Li; Kenji Watanabe; K N Houk; Yi Tang,Biocatalysis; Biosynthesis; Enzyme mechanisms; Enzymes,"Department of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering, University of California, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, California, USA.,

42ff798d751b4dd58d3e03b2dfb73f30,A Bayesian cluster analysis method for singlemolecule localization microscopy data,"Griffie et al. describe a protocol to perform cluster analysis of data generated from singlemolecule localization microscopy. Cell function is regulated by the spatiotemporal organization of the signaling machinery, and a key facet of this is molecular clustering. Here, we present a protocol for the analysis of clustering in data generated by 2D singlemolecule localization microscopy (SMLM)for example, photoactivated localization microscopy (PALM) or stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy (STORM). Three features of such data can cause standard cluster analysis approaches to be ineffective: (i) the data take the form of a list of points rather than a pixel array; (ii) there is a nonnegligible unclustered background density of points that must be accounted for; and (iii) each localization has an associated uncertainty in regard to its position. These issues are overcome using a Bayesian, modelbased approach. Many possible cluster configurations are proposed and scored against a generative model, which assumes Gaussian clusters overlaid on a completely spatially random (CSR) background, before every point is scrambled by its localization precision. We present the process of generating simulated and experimental data that are suitable to our algorithm, the analysis itself, and the extraction and interpretation of key cluster descriptors such as the number of clusters, cluster radii and the number of localizations per cluster. Variations in these descriptors can be interpreted as arising from changes in the organization of the cellular nanoarchitecture. The protocol requires no specific programming ability, and the processing time for one data set, typically containing 30 regions of interest, is 18 h; user input takes 1 h.",Juliette Griffie; Michael Shannon; Claire L Bromley; Lies Boelen; Garth L Burn; David J Williamson; Nicholas A Heard; Andrew P Cope; Dylan M Owen; Patrick RubinDelanchy,Image processing; Singlemolecule biophysics; Software; Superresolution microscopy,"Department of Physics and Randall Division of Cell and Molecular Biophysics, King's College London, London, UK; Department of Physics and Randall Division of Cell and Molecular Biophysics, King's College London, London, UK; MRC Centre for Developmental Biology, King's College London, London, UK; Faculty of Medicine, Imperial College London, London, UK; Department of Physics and Randall Division of Cell and Molecular Biophysics, King's College London, London, UK; Department of Physics and Randall Division of Cell and Molecular Biophysics, King's College London, London, UK; Department of Mathematics, Imperial College London and Heilbronn Institute for Mathematical Research, University of Bristol, Bristol, UK; Division of Immunology, Academic Department of Rheumatology, Infection and Inflammatory Disease, King's College London, London,, UK; Department of Physics and Randall Division of Cell and Molecular Biophysics, King's College London, London, UK; Department of Statistics, University of Oxford and Heilbronn Institute for Mathematical Research, University of Bristol, Bristol,, UK"
f7765a5bcadd49f3a0e016d2ba3c4a09,Preferential uptake of antioxidant carbon nanoparticles by T lymphocytes for immunomodulation,"Autoimmune diseases mediated by a type of white blood cellT lymphocytesare currently treated using mainly broadspectrum immunosuppressants that can lead to adverse side effects. Antioxidants represent an alternative approach for therapy of autoimmune disorders; however, dietary antioxidants are insufficient to play this role. Antioxidant carbon nanoparticles scavenge reactive oxygen species (ROS) with higher efficacy than dietary and endogenous antioxidants. Furthermore, the affinity of carbon nanoparticles for specific cell types represents an emerging tactic for celltargeted therapy. Here, we report that nontoxic poly(ethylene glycol)functionalized hydrophilic carbon clusters (PEGHCCs), known scavengers of the ROS superoxide (O2) and hydroxyl radical, are preferentially internalized by T lymphocytes over other splenic immune cells. We use this selectivity to inhibit T cell activation without affecting major functions of macrophages, antigenpresenting cells that are crucial for T cell activation. We also demonstrate the in vivo effectiveness of PEGHCCs in reducing T lymphocytemediated inflammation in delayedtype hypersensitivity and in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, an animal model of multiple sclerosis. Our results suggest the preferential targeting of PEGHCCs to T lymphocytes as a novel approach for T lymphocyte immunomodulation in autoimmune diseases without affecting other immune cells.",Redwan Huq; Errol L.

917835bfca7147149c1a4ed037b4b7a1,Three order increase in scanning speed of space chargecontrolled KTN deflector by eliminating electric field induced phase transition in nanodisordered KTN,"In this paper, we report a three ordersofmagnitude increase in the speed of a spacechargecontrolled KTN beam deflector achieved by eliminating the electric fieldinduced phase transition (EFIPT) in a nanodisordered KTN crystal. Previously, to maximize the electrooptic effect, a KTN beam deflector was operated at a temperature slightly above the Curie temperature. The electric field could cause the KTN to undergo a phase transition from the paraelectric phase to the ferroelectric phase at this temperature, which causes the deflector to operate in the linear electrooptic regime. Since the deflection angle of the deflector is proportional to the space charge distribution but not the magnitude of the applied electric field, the scanning speed of the beam deflector is limited by the electron mobility within the KTN crystal. To overcome this speed limitation caused by the EFIPT, we propose to operate the deflector at a temperature above the critical end point. This results in a significant increase in the scanning speed from the microsecond to nanosecond regime, which represents a major technological advance in the field of fast speed beam scanners. This can be highly beneficial for many applications including highspeed imaging, broadband optical communications, and ultrafast laser display and printing.",Wenbin Zhu; JuHung Chao; ChangJiang Chen; Shizhuo Yin; Robert C.

In this work, we report our attempt towards SERS based field biosensing, involving the development of a novel sustained and costeffective substrate composed of silver nanoparticles protected by small nitrogendoped Graphene Quantum Dots, i.e. Ag NPNGQD, and its systematic evaluation for glucose sensing. The new substrate demonstrated significantly stronger Raman enhancement compared to pure silver nanoparticles. More importantly, the new substrate preserved SERS performance in a normal indoor environment for at least 30 days in both the wet and dry states, in contrast to only 10 days for pure silver nanoparticles. The Ag NPNGQD thin film in the dry state was then successfully applied as a SERS substrate for glucose detection in mouse blood samples. The new substrate was synthesized under mild experimental conditions, and the cost increase due to NGQD was negligible. These results suggest that the Ag NPNGQD is a costeffective and sustained SERS substrate, the development of which represents an important step towards SERS based field biosensing.",Jian Ju; Wei Liu; Clint Michael Perlaki; Keren Chen; Chunhua Feng; Quan Liu,Raman spectroscopy; Surface plasmon resonance,"School of Chemical and Biomedical Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore, Singapore; School of Chemical and Biomedical Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore, Singapore; School of Chemical and Biomedical Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore, Singapore; School of Chemical and Biomedical Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore, Singapore; School of Chemical and Biomedical Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore, Singapore; School of Environment and Energy, South China University of Technology, Guangzhou, China; School of Chemical and Biomedical Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore, Singapore"

However, studies using animal models have indicated undesirable effects of in vitro embryo culture on offspring development and health. In vivo, the oviduct hosts a period in which the early embryo undergoes complete reprogramming of its (epi)genome in preparation for the reacquisition of (epi)genetic marks. We designed an oviductonachip platform to better investigate the mechanisms related to (epi)genetic reprogramming and the degree to which they differ between in vitro and in vivo embryos. The device supports more physiological (in vivolike) zygote genetic reprogramming than conventional IVF. This approach will be instrumental in identifying and investigating factors critical to fertilization and preimplantation development, which could improve the quality and (epi)genetic integrity of IVF zygotes with likely relevance for early embryonic and later fetal development. In vitro culture has detrimental effects on transcriptomes and epigenetic programming of zygotes. Here the authors use microfluidic technology to coculture bovine oviduct epithelial cells with zygotes and show that the transcriptomes and global methylation patterns of these zygotes are more similar to in vivo zygotes than to conventionally cultured zygotes.",Marcia A.

Here, Copeland and colleagues review the current understanding of RNA modifications with a focus on mRNA methylation and assess the potential of RMPs as novel anticancer targets. All major biological macromolecules (DNA, RNA, proteins and lipids) undergo enzymecatalysed covalent modifications that impact their structure, function and stability. A variety of covalent modifications of RNA have been identified and demonstrated to affect RNA stability and translation to proteins; these mechanisms of translational control have been termed epitranscriptomics. Emerging data suggest that some epitranscriptomic mechanisms are altered in human cancers as well as other human diseases.

7049a57f52d649c09e868d9768163e46,Extra virgin olive oil: More than a healthy fat,"The beneficial effects of a Mediterranean diet on human health and, in particular, on lowering risk of cardiovascular disease, has been mainly attributed to its high content to extra virgin olive oil (EVOO). While its main fatty acid, oleic acid, is considered important to these effects, EVOO has other biological properties that depend on, or are potentiated by other minor components of this oil. Initially, the mechanisms considered as possible causes of this cardioprotective effect of EVOO were based on the incidence on the socalled traditional risk factors (especially lipids and blood pressure). However, the high relative reduction in the prevalence of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality were not proportional to the limited findings about regulation of those traditional risk factors. In addition to several studies confirming the above effects, current research on beneficial effect of EVOO, and in particular in conjunction with Mediterranean style diets, is being focused on defining its effects on newer cardiovascular risk factors, such as inflammation, oxidative stress, coagulation, platelet aggregation, fibrinolysis, endothelial function or lipids or on the modulation of the conditions which predispose people to cardiovascular events, such as obesity, metabolic syndrome or type 2 diabetes mellitus. In the current review, we will mainly focus on reviewing the current evidence about the effects that EVOO exerts on alternative factors, including postprandial lipemia or coagulation, among others, discussing the underlying mechanism by which it exerts its effect, as well as providing a short review on future directions.",Elena M.

Frequently, colloids are used as sensitive probes, e.g., in biophysical applications from which molecular forces are inferred. The interpretation of such experiments rests on the assumption that, even when the particles are driven, the liquid remains in equilibrium. Here we experimentally demonstrate that this is not valid for particles in viscoelastic fluids. Even at small driving forces, we observe particle oscillations with several tens of seconds. They are attributed to nonequilibrium fluctuations of the fluid being excited by the particle's motion. The oscillatory dynamics is in quantitative agreement with an overdamped Langevin equation with negative frictionmemory term being equivalent to a stochastically driven underdamped oscillator. Such oscillatory modes are expected to widen the use of colloids as model systems but must also be considered in colloidal probe experiments. The motion of microparticles suspended in liquids is assumed to be dominated by viscous forces. Here, Berner et al. challenge this consensus by observing underdamped particle oscillations in a viscoelastic fluid and attributing it to the nonequilibrium fluctuations of liquid excited by particles.",Johannes Berner; Boris Muller; Juan Ruben GomezSolano; Matthias Kruger; Clemens Bechinger,Fluid dynamics; Thermodynamics,"2.

Spinorbit torques (SOTs) on MIs are more intriguing than magnetic metals since SOTs cannot be transferred to MIs through direct injection of electron spins. Understanding of SOTs on MIs remains elusive, especially how SOTs scale with the MI film thickness. Here, we observe the critical role of dimensionality on the SOT efficiency by studying the MI layer thicknessdependent SOT efficiency in tungstenthulium iron garnet (WTmIG) bilayers. We show that the TmIG thin film evolves from twodimensional to threedimensional magnetic phase transitions as the thickness increases. We report the significant enhancement of the measured SOT efficiency as the TmIG thickness increases, which is attributed to the increase of the magnetic moment density. We demonstrate the currentinduced SOT switching in the WTmIG bilayers with a TmIG thickness up to 15 nm.

d4e9e75dc0804a259c6dcbb42aacf274,A nanomedicine approach enables codelivery of cyclosporin A and gefitinib to potentiate the therapeutic efficacy in drugresistant lung cancer,"Drug resistance, accounting for therapeutic failure in the clinic, remains a major challenge to effectively manage cancer. Cyclosporin A (CsA) can reverse multidrug resistance (MDR), especially resistance to epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors. However, the application of both drugs in cancer therapies is hampered by their poor aqueous solubility and low bioavailability due to oral administration. CsA augments the potency of gefitinib (Gef) in both Gefsensitive and Gefresistant cell lines. Here, we show that the simultaneous encapsulation of CsA and Gef within polyethylene glycolblockpoly(D, Llactic acid) (PEGPLA) produced a stable and systemically injectable nanomedicine, which exhibited a sub50nm diameter and spherical structures. Impressively, the codelivery of therapeutics via single nanoparticles (NPs) outperformed the oral administration of the free drug combination at suppressing tumor growth. Furthermore, in vivo results indicated that CsA formulated in NPs sensitized Gefresistant cells and Gefresistant tumors to Gef treatment by inactivating the STAT3Bcl2 signaling pathway. Collectively, our nanomedicine approach not only provides an alternative administration route for the drugs of choice but also effectively reverses MDR, facilitating the development of effective therapeutic modalities for cancer. Injection of nanoparticles containing the anticancer drug gefitinib and the immunosuppressant cyclosporin A reverses drugresistant cancer growth in mice. The development of multidrug resistance is the main reason why many forms of chemotherapy fail. Cyclosporin A, a drug used to prevent immune rejection after organ transplantation, has previously been shown to enhance the potency of gefitinib. Hangxiang Wang and colleagues at Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China, have successfully combined cyclosporin A and gefitinib, two poorly watersoluble and slowly absorbed drugs, into stable injectable nanoparticles that delay the growth of gefitinib resistant human lung cancer cells as well as the growth of drug resistant tumors in mice. Importantly, this novel coformulation was more effective than oral coadministration of the two drugs. Further investigation into this drug delivery route could yield much needed alternative treatments for patients with multidrugresistant cancers.",Weidong Han; Linlin Shi; Lulu Ren; Liqian Zhou; Tongyu Li; Yiting Qiao; Hangxiang Wang,Drug delivery; Lung cancer; Molecular medicine,"Department of Medical Oncology, Sir Run Run Shaw Hospital, School of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China; Department of Medical Oncology, Sir Run Run Shaw Hospital, School of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China; Department of Medical Oncology, Sir Run Run Shaw Hospital, School of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China; The First Affiliated Hospital, Collaborative Innovation Center for Diagnosis and Treatment of Infectious Diseases, Key Laboratory of Combined MultiOrgan Transplantation, Ministry of Public Health, School of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China; The First Affiliated Hospital, Collaborative Innovation Center for Diagnosis and Treatment of Infectious Diseases, Key Laboratory of Combined MultiOrgan Transplantation, Ministry of Public Health, School of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China; The First Affiliated Hospital, Collaborative Innovation Center for Diagnosis and Treatment of Infectious Diseases, Key Laboratory of Combined MultiOrgan Transplantation, Ministry of Public Health, School of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China; The First Affiliated Hospital, Collaborative Innovation Center for Diagnosis and Treatment of Infectious Diseases, Key Laboratory of Combined MultiOrgan Transplantation, Ministry of Public Health, School of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China"

Decades of mostly experimental research has led to a large body of knowledge of the processingmicrostructureproperties linkages. But much of the existing understanding of point defects that play a significant role in the mechanical properties of titanium is based on semiempirical rules. In this work, we present the results of a detailed selfconsistent firstprinciples study that was developed to determine formation energies of intrinsic point defects including vacancies, selfinterstitials, and extrinsic point defects, such as, interstitial and substitutional impuritiesdopants. We find that most elements, regardless of size, prefer substitutional positions, but highly electronegative elements, such as C, N, O, F, S, and Cl, some of which are common impurities in Ti, occupy interstitial positions. First principles, not semiempirical rules, can systematically predict how point defects form because of impurities in titanium. A team led by Sanjeev Nayak and Rainer Herbert at the University of Connecticut, USA, used density functional theory to model the effect of more than twenty impurities in titanium, including the first twenty chemical elements as well as transition metals commonly added to titanium. Electronegative elements such as carbon and oxygen were stable at octahedral interstitial positions in the titanium lattice, in an identical manner to interstitial titanium. In contrast, metallic impurities such as vanadium preferred substitutional sites. Finally, vacancies in the lattice only persisted if they were far enough from their interstitial titanium atom. Research into point defect formation and stability may help us control materials for advanced manufacturing processes such as 3D printing.",Sanjeev K. Nayak; Cain J. Hung; Vinit Sharma; S.

It is prepared by the polymerization of aniline in frozen poly(vinyl alcohol) solutions. The biocompatibility of macroporous polyaniline cryogel was demonstrated by testing its cytotoxicity on mouse embryonic fibroblasts and via the test of embryotoxicity based on the formation of beating foci within spontaneous differentiating embryonic stem cells. Good biocompatibility was related to low contents of lowmolecularweight impurities in polyaniline cryogel, which was confirmed by liquid chromatography. The adhesion and growth of embryonic stem cells, embryoid bodies, cardiomyocytes, and neural progenitors prove that polyaniline cryogel has the potential to be used as a carrier for cells in tissue engineering or biosensing. The surface energy as well as the elasticity and porosity of cryogel mimic tissue properties.

a16e8fea892b4307a351b02576db4b3d,"Rational design, enantioselective synthesis and catalytic applications of axially chiral EBINOLs","Axially chiral 1,1binaphthols (BINOLs) and 1,1spirobiindanes (SPINOLs) have achieved great success in the field of asymmetric catalysis. Although several modifications of these skeletons have been reported, new useful scaffolds are in high demand for asymmetric catalysis. Here, on the basis of our ongoing research on atropisomeric alkenes, we have rationally designed a versatile disubstituted 1,1(ethene1,1diyl)binaphthol (EBINOL) scaffold, which would be a fine complement to 1,1binaphthyl and 1,1spirobiindane skeletons for asymmetric catalysis. To construct this axially chiral motif asymmetrically, a chiral phosphoric acidcatalysed asymmetric hydroarylation of alkynes has been developed. This approach features an efficient and convergent route to the synthesis of EBINOLs with high functional group tolerance, complete EZselectivity, and excellent enantioselectivities. Density function theory calculations reveal the mechanism and provide insights into the origins of the stereoselectivity and EZselectivity of this chiral Brnsted acidcatalysed alkyne activation method. The potent application of this structural scaffold is demonstrated by a series of asymmetric reactions catalysed by EBINOL derivatives. Axially chiral compounds have proven to be privileged catalystsligands for asymmetric catalysis, with BINOL, SPNIOL and their derivatives being particularly successful. Here the authors report a family of axially chiral alkenes, and demonstrate their use in asymmetric catalysis.

Nonthermal plasma (NTP) is a promising technique that can overcome barriers in conventional catalysis. Here we report an example of an NTPactivated watergas shift reaction (WGSR) over a MOF (HKUST1). Significantly, the exceptional stability of HKUST1 was sustained under NTP activation and in the presence of water, which led to a high specific rate of 8.8 h1. We found that NTPinduced water dissociation has a twofold promotion effect in WGSR, as it facilitates WGSR by supplying OH and sustains the stability and hence activity of HKUST1. In situ characterization of HKUST1 revealed the critical role of open Cu sites in the binding of substrate molecules. This study paves the way to utilize MOFs for a wider range of catalysis. MOFs have found limited application in catalysis so far, as the result of their limited thermal and hydrolytic stability. Now, nonthermal plasma is shown to be able to promote and sustain the activity of HKUST1 and other MOFs towards the watergas shift reaction despite the presence of water.

5fc1956a8e6f4515a5ab4b5ff6807ca3,Diverse manifestations of the midPleistocene climate transition,"The midPleistocene transition (MPT) is widely recognized as a shift in paleoclimatic periodicity from 41 to 100kyr cycles, which largely reflects integrated changes in global ice volume, sea level, and ocean temperature from the marine realm. However, much less is known about monsooninduced terrestrial vegetation change across the MPT. Here, on the basis of a 1.7millionyear 13C record of loess carbonates from the Chinese Loess Plateau, we document a unique MPT reflecting terrestrial vegetation changes from a dominant 23kyr periodicity before 1.2 Ma to combined 100, 41, and 23kyr cycles after 0.7 Ma, very different from the conventional MPT characteristics. Model simulations further reveal that the MPT transition likely reflects decreased sensitivity of monsoonal hydroclimate to insolation forcing as the Northern Hemisphere became increasingly glaciated through the MPT. Our proxymodel comparison suggests varied responses of temperature and precipitation to astronomical forcing under different iceCO2 boundary conditions, which greatly improves our understanding of monsoon variability and dynamics from the natural past to the anthropogenic future. The midPleistocene transition is recognized as a shift in paleoclimatic periodicity from 41 to 100kyr cycles. Here the authors present a unique midPleistocene transition of coupled monsoonvegetation changes from 23 to 100kyr cycles, which indicates varied sensitivity of past climate to astronomical and iceCO2 forcing.",Youbin Sun; Qiuzhen Yin; Michel Crucifix; Steven C.

We aimed to characterize the immune landscape of the CML BM and predict the current treatment goal of tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) therapy, molecular remission 4.0 (MR4.0). Using multiplex immunohistochemistry (mIHC) and automated image analysis, we studied BM tissues of CML patients (n  56) and controls (n  14) with a total of 30 immunophenotype markers essential in cancer immunology. CML patients' CD4 and CD8 Tcells expressed higher levels of putative exhaustion markers PD1, TIM3, and CTLA4 when compared to control. PD1 expression was higher in BM compared to paired peripheral blood (PB) samples, and decreased during TKI therapy. By combining clinical parameters and immune profiles, low CD4 Tcell proportion, high proportion of PD1TIM3CD8 T cells, and high PB neutrophil count were most predictive of lower MR4.0 likelihood. Low CD4 Tcell proportion and high PB neutrophil counts predicted MR4.0 also in a validation cohort (n  52) analyzed with flow cytometry. In summary, the CML BM is characterized by immune suppression and immune biomarkers predicted MR4.0, thus warranting further testing of immunomodulatory drugs in CML treatment.",Oscar Bruck; Sami Blom; Olli Dufva; Riku Turkki; Himanshu Chheda; Antonio Ribeiro; Panu Kovanen; Tero Aittokallio; Perttu Koskenvesa; Olli Kallioniemi; Kimmo Porkka; Teijo Pellinen; Satu Mustjoki,Cancer microenvironment; Chronic myeloid leukaemia; Immunoediting; Translational research,"Hematology Research Unit Helsinki, University of Helsinki and Department of Hematology, Helsinki University Hospital Comprehensive Cancer Center, Helsinki, Finland; Institute for Molecular Medicine Finland, University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland; Hematology Research Unit Helsinki, University of Helsinki and Department of Hematology, Helsinki University Hospital Comprehensive Cancer Center, Helsinki, Finland; Institute for Molecular Medicine Finland, University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland; Institute for Molecular Medicine Finland, University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland; Institute for Molecular Medicine Finland, University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland; Department of Pathology, University of Helsinki and HUSLAB, Helsinki University Hospital, Helsinki, Finland; Institute for Molecular Medicine Finland, University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland; Department of Mathematics and Statistics, University of Turku, Turku, Finland; Hematology Research Unit Helsinki, University of Helsinki and Department of Hematology, Helsinki University Hospital Comprehensive Cancer Center, Helsinki, Finland; Institute for Molecular Medicine Finland, University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland; Science for Life Laboratory, Karolinska Institutet, Department of Oncology and Pathology, Solna, Sweden; Hematology Research Unit Helsinki, University of Helsinki and Department of Hematology, Helsinki University Hospital Comprehensive Cancer Center, Helsinki, Finland; Institute for Molecular Medicine Finland, University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland; Hematology Research Unit Helsinki, University of Helsinki and Department of Hematology, Helsinki University Hospital Comprehensive Cancer Center, Helsinki, Finland; Department of Clinical Chemistry, University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland"

These HHF actuators are responsive to external stimuli in a rapid and reversible manner. Mechanically responsive materials that are able to sense and respond to external stimuli have important applications in soft robotics and the formation of artificial muscles, such as intelligent electronics, prosthetic limbs, comfortadjusting textiles and miniature actuators for microfluidics. However, previous artificial muscles based on polymer materials are insufficient in generating large actuations, fast responses, diverse deformation modes and high cycle performances. To this end, carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are proposed as promising candidates to be assembled into artificial muscles, as they are lightweight, robust and have high surfacetovolume ratios. This protocol describes a reproducible biomimetic method for preparing a family of hierarchically arranged helical fiber (HHF) actuators that are responsive to solvents and vapors. These HHFs are produced through helical assembly of CNTs into primary fibers and further twisting of the multiply primary fibers into a helical structure. A large number of nanoscale gaps between the CNTs and micronscale gaps between the primary fibers ensure large volume changes and fast responses upon the infiltration of solvents and vapors (e.g., water, ethanol, acetone and dichloromethane) by capillarity. The modes of shape transformations can be modulated precisely by controlling how the CNTs are assembled into primary fibers, multiply primary fibers, HHFs and hierarchical springs. This protocol provides a prototype for preparing actuators with different fiber components.

When the aluminium contains the smallest amount of added master alloy, ultrasonics caused significant additional grain refinement compared to that provided by the master alloy alone. However, the influence of ultrasonics on grain size reduces with increasing addition of the master alloy which adds additional TiB2 particles and Ti solute with each incremental addition. Applying the Interdependence model to analyse the experimentally measured grain sizes revealed that the results of this study and those from similar experiments on an Al2Cu alloy were consistent when the alloy compositions are converted to their growth restriction factors (Q) and that increasing Q had a major effect on reducing grain size and increasing grain number density. Compared with the application of ultrasonic treatment where an order of magnitude increase in the grain number density is achieved, an increase in the Ti content over the range of master alloy additions, causes the grain number density to increase by approximately three times.",G.

7d9034008cf442d595e4affc912fadfb,Widedynamicrange kinetic investigations of deep proton tunnelling in proteins,"Directional proton transport along 'wires' that feed biochemical reactions in proteins is poorly understood. Aminoacid residues with high pKa are seldom considered as active transport elements in such wires because of their large classical barrier for proton dissociation. Here, we use the lighttriggered proton wire of the green fluorescent protein to study its groundelectronicstate protontransport kinetics, revealing a large temperaturedependent kinetic isotope effect. We show that 'deep' proton tunnelling between hydrogenbonded oxygen atoms with a typical donoracceptor distance of 2.72.8 A fully accounts for the rates at all temperatures, including the unexpectedly large value (2.5  109 s1) found at room temperature. The ratelimiting step in green fluorescent protein is assigned to tunnelling of the ionizationresistant serine hydroxyl proton. This suggests how highpKa residues within a proton wire can act as a 'tunnel diode' to kinetically trap protons and control the direction of proton flow. A temperaturedependent kinetic study of groundstate proton transfer in the green fluorescent protein highlights the role of 'deep tunnelling' in proton wires.

Mesenchymal StemStromal Cell (MSC) migration towards degenerated IVD may represent a viable strategy to promote tissue repairregeneration. Here, human MSCs (hMSCs) were seeded on top of cartilaginous endplates (CEP) of nucleotomized IVDs of bovine origin and cultured ex vivo up to 3 weeks. hMSCs migrated from CEP towards the lesion area and significantly increased expression of collagen type II and aggrecan in IVD, namely in the nucleus pulposus. Concomitantly, hMSCs stimulated the production of growth factors, promoters of ECM synthesis, such as fibroblast growth factor 6 (FGF6) and 7 (FGF7), plateletderived growth factor receptor (PDGFR), granulocytemacrophage colonystimulating factor (GMCSF) and insulinlike growth factor 1 receptor (IGF1sR). Overall, our results demonstrate that CEP can be an alternative route to MSCbased therapies for IVD regeneration through ECM remodeling, thus opening new perspectives on endogenous repair capacity through MSC recruitment.",Catarina Leite Pereira; Graciosa Q.

One major shortcoming in previous studies of ionirradiated films is the assumption that constituent phases in ionirradiated and heattreated films are identical and that the ion irradiation effect is limited to changes in composition. In this study, we investigate the effects of ion irradiation on both the composition and structure of constituent phases and use the results to explain the measured elastic modulus of the films. The results indicated that the microstructure of the irradiated films consisted of carbon clusters within a silica matrix. It was found that carbon was present in a nongraphitic sp2bonded configuration. It was also observed that ion irradiation caused a decrease in the SiOSi bond angle of silica, similar to the effects of applied pressure. A phase transformation from tetrahedrally bonded to octahedrally bonded silica was also observed. The results indicated the incorporation of carbon within the silica network. A combination of the decrease in SiOSi bond angle and an increase in the carbon incorporation within the silica network was found to be responsible for the increase in the elastic modulus of the films.",S.

Most efforts to understand neural activity during welllearned tasks focus on cognitive computations and taskrelated movements. We wondered whether taskperforming animals explore a broader movement landscape and how this impacts neural activity. We characterized movements using video and other sensors and measured neural activity using widefield and twophoton imaging. Cortexwide activity was dominated by movements, especially uninstructed movements not required for the task. Some uninstructed movements were aligned to trial events. Accounting for them revealed that neurons with similar trialaveraged activity often reflected utterly different combinations of cognitive and movement variables. Other movements occurred idiosyncratically, accounting for trialbytrial fluctuations that are often considered 'noise'. This held true throughout tasklearning and for extracellular Neuropixels recordings that included subcortical areas. Our observations argue that animals execute expert decisions while performing richly varied, uninstructed movements that profoundly shape neural activity. The authors use a linear model to reveal how neural activity patterns are related to cognition or movements. They find that uninstructed movements dominate singlecell and population activity throughout the brain, outpacing taskrelated activity.",Simon Musall; Matthew T. Kaufman; Ashley L.

40e936ec1d3247e98fc5c5aa09b515c1,Latelife targeting of the IGF1 receptor improves healthspan and lifespan in female mice,"Diminished growth factor signaling improves longevity in laboratory models, while a reduction in the somatotropic axis is favorably linked to human aging and longevity. Given the conserved role of this pathway on lifespan, therapeutic strategies, such as insulinlike growth factor1 receptor (IGF1R) monoclonal antibodies (mAb), represent a promising translational tool to target human aging. To this end, we performed a preclinical study in 18moold male and female mice treated with vehicle or an IGF1R mAb (L2Cmu, Amgen Inc), and determined effects on aging outcomes. Here we show that L2Cmu preferentially improves female healthspan and increases median lifespan by 9% (P  0.03) in females, along with a reduction in neoplasms and inflammation (P  0.05). Thus, consistent with other models, targeting IGF1R signaling appears to be most beneficial to females. Importantly, these effects could be achieved at advanced ages, suggesting that IGF1R mAbs could represent a promising therapeutic candidate to delay aging. Reduced IGF1 signaling increases longevity in many organisms. Here, Mao et al. show that administration of an antiIGF1R antibody is well tolerated and delays aging in female mice; importantly, latelife targeting is sufficient to achieve the beneficial effects.",Kai Mao; Gabriela Farias Quipildor; Tahmineh Tabrizian; Ardijana Novaj; Fangxia Guan; Ryan O.

Many genes conserved in other plant species have been deleted from the G. elata genome, including most of those for photosynthesis. Additional evidence of the influence of genome plasticity in the adaptation of this mycoheterotrophic lifestyle is evident in the large number of gene families that are expanded in G. elata, including glycoside hydrolases and urease that likely facilitate the digestion of hyphae are expanded, as are genes associated with strigolactone signaling, and ATPases that may contribute to the atypical energy metabolism. We also find that the plastid genome of G. elata is markedly smaller than that of green plant species while its mitochondrial genome is one of the largest observed to date.

0f533eeb7119464093bfec1c609c1830,Plastid phylogenomics with broad taxon sampling further elucidates the distinct evolutionary origins and timing of secondary green plastids,"Secondary plastids derived from green algae occur in chlorarachniophytes, photosynthetic euglenophytes, and the dinoflagellate genus Lepidodinium. Recent advances in understanding the origin of these plastids have been made, but analyses suffer from relatively sparse taxon sampling within the green algal groups to which they are related. In this study we aim to derive new insights into the identity of the plastid donors, and when in geological time the independent endosymbiosis events occurred. We use newly sequenced green algal chloroplast genomes from carefully chosen lineages potentially related to chlorarachniophyte and Lepidodinium plastids, combined with recently published chloroplast genomes, to present taxonrich phylogenetic analyses to further pinpoint plastid origins. We integrate phylogenies with fossil information and relaxed molecular clock analyses. Our results indicate that the chlorarachniophyte plastid may originate from a precusor of siphonous green algae or a closely related lineage, whereas the Lepidodinium plastid originated from a pedinophyte. The euglenophyte plastid putatively originated from a lineage of prasinophytes within the order Pyramimonadales. Our molecular clock analyses narrow in on the likely timing of the secondary endosymbiosis events, suggesting that the event leading to Lepidodinium likely occurred more recently than those leading to the chlorarachniophyte and photosynthetic euglenophyte lineages.",Christopher Jackson; Andrew H.

2de55705253d4e939561ac08479dac4b,Neuropsychiatric lupus: new mechanistic insights and future treatment directions,"Patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) frequently show symptoms of central nervous system (CNS) involvement, termed neuropsychiatric SLE (NPSLE). The CNS manifestations of SLE are diverse and have a broad spectrum of severity and prognostic implications. Patients with NPSLE typically present with nonspecific symptoms, such as headache and cognitive impairment, but might also experience devastating features, such as memory loss, seizures and stroke. Some features of NPSLE, in particular those related to coagulopathy, have been characterized and an evidencebased treatment algorithm is available. The cognitive and affective manifestations of NPSLE, however, remain poorly understood. Various immune effectors have been evaluated as contributors to its pathogenesis, including brainreactive autoantibodies, cytokines and cellmediated inflammation. Additional brainintrinsic elements (such as resident microglia, the bloodbrain barrier and other neurovascular interfaces) are important facilitators of NPSLE. As yet, however, no unifying model has been found to underlie the pathogenesis of NPSLE, suggesting that this disease has multiple contributors and perhaps several distinct aetiologies. This heterogeneity presents a challenge for clinicians who have traditionally relied on empirical judgement in choosing treatment modalities for patients with NPSLE. Improved understanding of this manifestation of SLE might yield further options for managing this disease. Neuropsychiatric systemic lupus erythematosus (NPSLE) remains highly challenging to diagnose and treat. This Review describes current understanding of its pathogenesis, along with novel therapies and diagnostic tools that could eventually improve the management of NPSLE.

However, the entity of organelletethering factors is not well understood due to lack of means to analyze interorganelle interactions in living cells. Here we evaluate the splitGFP system for visualizing organelle contact sites in vivo and show its advantages and disadvantages. We observed punctate GFP signals from the splitGFP fragments targeted to any pairs of organelles among the ER, mitochondria, peroxisomes, vacuole and lipid droplets in yeast cells, which suggests that these organelles form contact sites with multiple organelles simultaneously although it is difficult to rule out the possibilities that these organelle contacts sites are artificially formed by the irreversible associations of the splitGFP probes. Importantly, splitGFP signals in the overlapped regions of the ER and mitochondria were mainly colocalized with ERMES, an authentic ERmitochondria tethering structure, suggesting that splitGFP assembly depends on the preexisting interorganelle contact sites. We also confirmed that the splitGFP system can be applied to detection of the ERmitochondria contact sites in HeLa cells. We thus propose that the splitGFP system is a potential tool to observe and analyze interorganelle contact sites in living yeast and mammalian cells.",Yuriko Kakimoto; Shinya Tashiro; Rieko Kojima; Yuki Morozumi; Toshiya Endo; Yasushi Tamura,Fluorescence imaging; Organelles,"Faculty of Science, Yamagata University, Yamagata, Japan; Faculty of Science, Yamagata University, Yamagata, Japan; Faculty of Science, Yamagata University, Yamagata, Japan; Faculty of Science, Yamagata University, Yamagata, Japan; Faculty of Life Sciences, Kyoto Sangyo University, Kamigamomotoyama, Kitaku, Kyoto, Japan; Faculty of Science, Yamagata University, Yamagata, Japan"

However, their emissions, atmospheric distribution, and trends in their atmospheric concentrations are insufficiently understood. Atmospheric model simulations using standard community emission inventories do not reproduce available measurements in the Northern Hemisphere. Here, we show that observations of preindustrial and presentday ethane and propane can be reproduced in simulations with a detailed atmospheric chemistry transport model, provided that natural geologic emissions are taken into account and anthropogenic fossil fuel emissions are assumed to be two to three times higher than is indicated in current inventories. Accounting for these enhanced ethane and propane emissions results in simulated surface ozone concentrations that are 513% higher than previously assumed in some polluted regions in Asia. The improved correspondence with observed ethane and propane in model simulations with greater emissions suggests that the level of fossil (geologic  fossil fuel) methane emissions in current inventories may need reevaluation. Observations of ethane and propane distributions in the atmosphere are reproduced in simulations with an atmospheric chemistry transport model, if fossil emissions are a factor of two to three higher than previously assumed.",Stig B.

These include stars disrupted by the central supermassive black hole, and supernovae that are 10100 times more energetic than typical ones.

                . Here we report the discovery of the most energetic of these to date: PS110adi, with a total radiated energy of ~2.3  1052 erg. The slow evolution of its light curve and persistently narrow spectral lines over  3 yr are inconsistent with known types of recurring black hole variability. The observed properties imply powering by shock interaction between expanding material and large quantities of surrounding dense matter. Plausible sources of this expanding material are a star that has been tidally disrupted by the central black hole, or a supernova. Both could satisfy the energy budget. For the former, we would be forced to invoke a new and hitherto unseen variant of a tidally disrupted star, while a supernova origin relies principally on environmental effects resulting from its nuclear location. Remarkably, we also discover that PS110adi is not an isolated case. We therefore surmise that this new population of transients has previously been overlooked due to incorrect association with underlying central black hole activity. The discovery of the most energetic transient event to date is reported. Its spectroscopic properties and temporal evolution imply it is powered by shock interaction between expanding material and large quantities of surrounding dense matter.",E. Kankare; R. Kotak; S.

25ab420efdcb4dbd94f17b21962c20c5,The mTORC14EBPeIF4E axis controls de novo Bcl6 protein synthesis in T cells and systemic autoimmunity,"Posttranscriptional modifications can control protein abundance, but the extent to which these alterations contribute to the expression of T helper (TH) lineagedefining factors is unknown. Tight regulation of Bcl6 expression, an essential transcription factor for T follicular helper (TFH) cells, is critical as aberrant TFH cell expansion is associated with autoimmune diseases, such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Here we show that lack of the SLE risk variant Def6 results in deregulation of Bcl6 protein synthesis in T cells as a result of enhanced activation of the mTORC14EBPeIF4E axis, secondary to aberrant assembly of a raptorp62TRAF6 complex. Proteomic analysis reveals that this pathway selectively controls the abundance of a subset of proteins. Rapamycin or raptor deletion ameliorates the aberrant TFH cell expansion in mice lacking Def6. Thus deregulation of mTORC1dependent pathways controlling protein synthesis can result in Tcell dysfunction, indicating a mechanism by which mTORC1 can promote autoimmunity. Excessive expansion of the T follicular helper (TFH) cell pool is associated with autoimmune disease and Def6 has been identified as an SLE risk variant. Here the authors show that Def6 limits proliferation of TFH cells in mice via alteration of mTORC1 signaling and inhibition of Bcl6 expression.",Woelsung Yi; Sanjay Gupta; Edd Ricker; Michela Manni; Rolf Jessberger; Yurii Chinenov; Henrik Molina; Alessandra B.

8d570080aed0441fa926d3ba25548a9b,In Vitro Characterization and Concerted Function of Three Core Enzymes of a Glycyl Radical Enzyme  Associated Bacterial Microcompartment,"Many bacteria encode proteinaceous bacterial microcompartments (BMCs) that encapsulate sequential enzymatic reactions of diverse metabolic pathways. Wellcharacterized BMCs include carboxysomes for CO2fixation, and propanediol and ethanolamineutilizing microcompartments that contain B12dependent enzymes. Genes required to form BMCs are typically organized in gene clusters, which promoted their distribution across phyla by horizontal gene transfer. Recently, BMCs associated with glycyl radical enzymes (GREs) were discovered; these are widespread and comprise at least three functionally distinct types. Previously, we predicted one type of these GREassociated microcompartments (GRMs) represents a B12independent propanediolutilizing BMC. Here we functionally and structurally characterize enzymes of the GRM of Rhodopseudomonas palustris BisB18 and demonstrate their concerted function in vitro. The GRM signature enzyme, the GRE, is a dedicated 1,2propanediol dehydratase with a new type of intramolecular encapsulation peptide. It forms a complex with its activating enzyme and, in conjunction with an aldehyde dehydrogenase, converts 1,2propanediol to propionylCoA. Notably, homologous GRMs are also encoded in pathogenic Escherichia coli strains. Our highresolution crystal structures of the aldehyde dehydrogenase lead to a revised reaction mechanism. The successful in vitro reconstitution of a part of the GRM metabolism provides insights into the metabolic function and steps in the assembly of this BMC.",Jan Zarzycki; Markus Sutter; Nina Socorro Cortina; Tobias J.

e9169d67d3fb4e59826e9d91b4eeb588,A new frontier in CO 2 flux measurements using a highly portable DIAL laser system,"Volcanic CO2 emissions play a key role in the geological carbon cycle and monitoring of volcanic CO2 fluxes helps to forecast eruptions. The quantification of CO2 fluxes is challenging due to rapid dilution of magmatic CO2 in CO2rich ambient air and the diffuse nature of many emissions, leading to large uncertainties in the global magmatic CO2 flux inventory. Here, we report measurements using a new DIAL laser remote sensing system for volcanic CO2 (CO2DIAL). Two sites in the volcanic zone of Campi Flegrei (Italy) were scanned, yielding CO2 pathamount profiles used to compute fluxes. Our results reveal a relatively high CO2 flux from Campi Flegrei, consistent with an increasing trend. Unlike previous methods, the CO2DIAL is able to measure integrated CO2 pathamounts at distances up to 2000 m using virtually any solid surface as a reflector, whilst also being highly portable. This opens a new frontier in quantification of geological and anthropogenic CO2 fluxes.",Manuel Queier; Domenico Granieri; Mike Burton,Environmental impact; Natural hazards,"School of Earth, Atmospheric and Environmental Sciences, University of Manchester, Manchester, UK; Istituto Nazionale di Geofisica e Vulcanologia (INGV), Sezione di Pisa, Italy; School of Earth, Atmospheric and Environmental Sciences, University of Manchester, Manchester, UK"
46891d2673b441c29a0a22cc190d308d,Magnetodielectric detection of magnetic quadrupole order in Ba(TiO)Cu 4 (PO 4 ) 4 with Cu 4 O 12 square cupolas,"In vortexlike spin arrangements, multiple spins can combine into emergent multipole moments. Such multipole moments have broken spaceinversion and timereversal symmetries, and can therefore exhibit linear magnetoelectric (ME) activity. Three types of such multipole moments are known: toroidal; monopole; and quadrupole moments. So far, however, the ME activity of these multipole moments has only been established experimentally for the toroidal moment. Here we propose a magnetic square cupola cluster, in which four cornersharing squarecoordinated metalligand fragments form a noncoplanar buckled structure, as a promising structural unit that carries an MEactive multipole moment. We substantiate this idea by observing clear magnetodielectric signals associated with an antiferroic MEactive magnetic quadrupole order in the real material Ba(TiO)Cu4(PO4)4. The present result serves as a useful guide for exploring and designing new MEactive materials based on vortexlike spin arrangements. Experimental knowledge of magnetoelectric (ME) activity from magnetic multipole moments has so far been limited. Here, Kimura et al. show that a magnetic square cupola cluster such as Cu4O12 realized in Ba(TiO)Cu4(PO4)4is a promising structural unit carrying MEactive magnetic quadrupole moments.

Immunomodulation aimed at maximizing the beneficial effects while minimizing the detrimental roles of the innate immunity may aid functional recovery after SCI. However, intracellular drivers of global reprogramming of the inflammatory gene networks in the innate immune cells are poorly understood. Here we show that SCI resulted in an upregulation of histone deacetylase 3 (HDAC3) in the innate immune cells at the injury site. Remarkably, blocking HDAC3 with a selective small molecule inhibitor shifted microgliamacrophage responses towards inflammatory suppression, resulting in neuroprotective phenotypes and improved functional recovery in SCI model. Mechanistically, HDAC3 activity is largely responsible for histone deacetylation and inflammatory responses of primary microglia to classic inflammatory stimuli. Our results reveal a novel function of HDAC3 inhibitor in promoting functional recovery after SCI by dampening inflammatory cytokines, thus pointing towards a new direction of immunomodulation for SCI repair.",Tomoharu Kuboyama; Shalaka Wahane; Yong Huang; Xiang Zhou; Jamie K.

35df94e7f3094f929d13918e46deee93,Two pathways regulate cortical granule translocation to prevent polyspermy in mouse oocytes,"An egg must be fertilized by a single sperm only. To prevent polyspermy, the zona pellucida, a structure that surrounds mammalian eggs, becomes impermeable upon fertilization, preventing the entry of further sperm. The structural changes in the zona upon fertilization are driven by the exocytosis of cortical granules. These translocate from the oocyte's centre to the plasma membrane during meiosis. However, very little is known about the mechanism of cortical granule translocation. Here we investigate cortical granule transport and dynamics in live mammalian oocytes by using Rab27a as a marker. We show that two separate mechanisms drive their transport: myosin Vadependent movement along actin filaments, and an unexpected vesicle hitchhiking mechanism by which cortical granules bind to Rab11a vesicles powered by myosin Vb. Inhibiting cortical granule translocation severely impaired the block to sperm entry, suggesting that translocation defects could contribute to miscarriages that are caused by polyspermy. Mammalian eggs release cortical granules to avoid being fertilized by more than a single sperm as polyspermy results in nonviable embryos. Here, the authors describe the mechanism driving translocation of the granules to the cortex in the mouse egg and show this process is essential to prevent polyspermy.",Liam P.

The authors use the MIXED procedure to deal with instances in which data are missing, by fitting linear models with general error covariance structures. Testing of therapies for disease or injury often involves the analysis of longitudinal data from animals. Modern analytical methods have advantages over conventional methods (particularly when some data are missing), yet they are not used widely by preclinical researchers. Here we provide an easytouse protocol for the analysis of longitudinal data from animals, and we present a clickbyclick guide for performing suitable analyses using the statistical package IBM SPSS Statistics software (SPSS). We guide readers through the analysis of a reallife data set obtained when testing a therapy for brain injury (stroke) in elderly rats. If a few data points are missing, as in this example data set (for example, because of animal dropout), repeatedmeasures analysis of covariance may fail to detect a treatment effect. An alternative analysis method, such as the use of linear models (with various covariance structures), and analysis using restricted maximum likelihood estimation (to include all available data) can be used to better detect treatment effects.

6282e6e5808d4c3eaf2bf5264ac3ba31,Highresolution mapping of infraslow cortical brain activity enabled by graphene microtransistors,"Recording infraslow brain signals (0.1 Hz) with microelectrodes is severely hampered by current microelectrode materials, primarily due to limitations resulting from voltage drift and high electrode impedance. Hence, most recording systems include highpass filters that solve saturation issues but come hand in hand with loss of physiological and pathological information. In this work, we use flexible epicortical and intracortical arrays of graphene solutiongated fieldeffect transistors (gSGFETs) to map cortical spreading depression in rats and demonstrate that gSGFETs are able to record, with high fidelity, infraslow signals together with signals in the typical local field potential bandwidth. The wide recording bandwidth results from the direct fieldeffect coupling of the active transistor, in contrast to standard passive electrodes, as well as from the electrochemical inertness of graphene. Taking advantage of such functionality, we envision broad applications of gSGFET technology for monitoring infraslow brain activity both in research and in the clinic. Arrays of graphene microtransistors are used to record infraslow cortical brain activity. The reduced signal drift and the array compatibility with optical imaging techniques make these devices useful for monitoring of brain physiology.",Eduard MasvidalCodina; Xavi Illa; Miguel Dasilva; Andrea Bonaccini Calia; Tanja Dragojevic; Ernesto E.

However, current hydrazine splitting is achieved using external powers to drive the two reactions, which is inapplicable to outdoor use. Here, Fedoped CoS2 nanosheets are developed as a bifunctional electrocatalyst for the two reactions, by which direct hydrazine fuel cells and overallhydrazinesplitting units are realized and integrated to form a selfpowered H2 production system. Without external powers, this system employs hydrazine bifunctionally as the fuel of direct hydrazine fuel cell and the splitting target, namely a sole consumable, and exhibits an H2 evolution rate of 9.95 mmol h1, a 98% Faradaic efficiency and a 20h stability, all comparable to the best reported for selfpowered water splitting. These performances are due to that Fe doping decreases the freeenergy changes of H adsorption and adsorbed NH2NH2 dehydrogenation on CoS2. While water electrolysis provides an attractive means to produce highenergy hydrogen (H2), the process imposes significant material overpotential barriers.

Despite constant progress in chemical synthesis, the construction of complex polycyclic sesqui and diterpene scaffolds remains challenging. However, natural cyclase enzymes are able to form the whole variety of terpene structures from just a handful of linear precursors. Manmade catalysts able to mimic such natural enzymes are lacking. Here, we describe examples of sesquiterpene cyclizations inside an enzymemimicking supramolecular catalyst. This strategy allowed the formation of the tricyclic sesquiterpene isolongifolene in only four steps. The mechanism of the catalysed cyclization reaction was elucidated using 13Clabelling studies and density functional theory calculations. The synthesis of complex terpene compounds in the laboratory using manmade catalysts has proven to be much more complicated than in nature. Now, Tiefenbacher and coworkers report the use of an enzymemimicking supramolecular catalyst for the efficient and short synthesis of tricyclic sesquiterpenes.

One of the crucial effects they exerted is immunesuppression, which was reported recently, however, the overall mechanism has not been fully addressed. In this study, it was shown that TAMs were enriched in colorectal cancer, and their infiltration was associated with VCAM1 expression. Human colorectal cancerderived CAFs can promote the adhesion of monocytes by upregulating VCAM1 expression in colorectal cancer cells. Furthermore, CAFs can attract monocytes by secreting IL8 rather than SDF1 and subsequently promote M2 polarization of macrophages, which synergize with CAFs in suppressing the functioning of natural killer (NK) cells. It was also found that CAFs promoted M2 macrophages recruitment in tumor tissue in vivo, and after VCAM1 knockingdown in tumor cells or depletion of macrophages, the protumor effect of CAFs was partly abolished, but no change was observed in NK cells infiltration. Collectively, the findings in this work show that TAMs and CAFs function synergistically in the tumor microenvironment and have the capacity to regulate NK cells in colorectal cancer and this presents a novel mechanism.",Rongsheng Zhang; Fan Qi; Fei Zhao; Geng Li; Shengli Shao; Xiaochao Zhang; Lifei Yuan; Yongdong Feng,Cancer microenvironment; Chemokines,"Cancer Research Institute, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China; Department of OtolaryngologyHead and Neck Surgery, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China; Jinzhou Medical University, Jinzhou, China; Cancer Research Institute, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China; Cancer Research Institute, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China; Cancer Research Institute, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China; Cancer Research Institute, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China; Cancer Research Institute, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"

PINTA measures VCS and VPC fluxes over a wide range of physiological conditions with minimal pyruvate cycling and detects increased hepatic VCS following treatment with a livertargeted mitochondrial uncoupler. Finally, validation studies in humans demonstrate that the VPCVCS ratio measured by PINTA is similar to that determined by in vivo NMR spectroscopy. This method will provide investigators with a relatively simple tool to noninvasively examine the role of altered hepatic mitochondrial metabolism.

d7943396d1ac412cb3b4a457cf07e0e6,Mesenchymal stem cells secretomeinduced axonal outgrowth is mediated by BDNF,"Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have been used for cellbased therapies in regenerative medicine, with increasing importance in central and peripheral nervous system repair. However, MSCs grafting present disadvantages, such as, a high number of cells required for transplantation and low survival rate when transplanted into the central nervous system (CNS). In line with this, MSCs secretome which present on its composition a wide range of molecules (neurotrophins, cytokines) and microvesicles, can be a solution to surpass these problems. However, the effect of MSCs secretome in axonal elongation is poorly understood. In this study, we demonstrate that application of MSCs secretome to both rat cortical and hippocampal neurons induces an increase in axonal length. In addition, we show that this growth effect is axonal intrinsic with no contribution from the cell body. To further understand which are the molecules required for secretomeinduced axonal outgrowth effect, we depleted brainderived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) from the secretome. Our results show that in the absence of BDNF, secretomeinduced axonal elongation effect is lost and that axons present a reduced axonal growth rate. Altogether, our results demonstrate that MSCs secretome is able to promote axonal outgrowth in CNS neurons and this effect is mediated by BDNF.",Luis F. Martins; Rui O. Costa; Joana R.

RECQL4, deficient in RothmundThomson Syndrome, promotes the two major DSB repair pathways, nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ) and homologous recombination (HR). Here we report that RECQL4 promotes and coordinates NHEJ and HR in different cell cycle phases. RECQL4 interacts with Ku70 to promote NHEJ in G1 when overall cyclindependent kinase (CDK) activity is low. During SG2 phases, CDK1 and CDK2 (CDK12) phosphorylate RECQL4 on serines 89 and 251, enhancing MRE11RECQL4 interaction and RECQL4 recruitment to DSBs. After phosphorylation, RECQL4 is ubiquitinated by the DDB1CUL4A E3 ubiquitin ligase, which facilitates its accumulation at DSBs. Phosphorylation of RECQL4 stimulates its helicase activity, promotes DNA end resection, increases HR and cell survival after ionizing radiation, and prevents cellular senescence. Collectively, we propose that RECQL4 modulates the pathway choice of NHEJ and HR in a cell cycledependent manner. DNA doublestrand break (DSB) repair is a tightly regulated process that can occur via nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ) or homologous recombination (HR). Here, the authors investigate how RECQL4 modulates DSB repair pathway choice by differentially regulating NHEJ and HR in a cell cycledependent manner.",Huiming Lu; Raghavendra A.

We show how their deformation behaviour, hence their mechanical properties and final configuration for a given applied load, can be manipulated solely by altering the resistance to rotational motion of the hinges within the system. This provides enhanced tunability without necessarily changing the geometry of the system, a phenomenon which is not typically observed in other nonhierarchical unimode auxetic systems. This gives this hierarchical system increased versatility and tunability thus making it more amenable to be employed in practical application which may range from smart filtration to smart dressings.",Krzysztof K.

The repeated explosive radiations of African cichlid fishes in distinct lakes, following a dietary diversification in a context of reduced genetic diversity, provide a natural setup to explore convergence, divergence and repeatability in patterns of microbiota dynamics as a function of the host diet, phylogeny and environment. Here we characterized by 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing the gut microbiota of 29 cichlid species from two distinct lakesradiations (Tanganyika and Barombi Mbo) and across a broad dietary and phylogenetic range. Within each lake, a significant deviation between a carnivorous and herbivorous lifestyle was found. Herbivore species were characterized by an increased bacterial taxonomic and functional diversity and converged in key compositional and functional community aspects. Despite a significant lake effect on the microbiota structure, this process has occurred with remarkable parallels in the two lakes. A metabolic signature most likely explains this trend, as indicated by a significant enrichment in herbivoresomnivores of bacterial taxa and functions associated with fiber degradation and detoxification of plant chemical compounds. Overall, compositional and functional aspects of the gut microbiota individually and altogether validate and predict main cichlid dietary habits, suggesting a fundamental role of gut bacteria in cichlid niche expansion and adaptation.",Laura Baldo; Joan Lluis Pretus; Joan Lluis Riera; Zuzana Musilova; Arnold Roger Bitja Nyom; Walter Salzburger,Metagenomics; Microbial ecology; Microbiome,"Department of Evolutionary Biology, Ecology and Environmental Sciences, University of Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain; Department of Evolutionary Biology, Ecology and Environmental Sciences, University of Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain; Department of Evolutionary Biology, Ecology and Environmental Sciences, University of Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain; Zoological Institute, University of Basel, Basel, Switzerland; Department of Zoology, Charles University in Prague, Prague, Czech Republic; Faculty of Science, University of Ngaoundere, Ngaoundere, Cameroon; Zoological Institute, University of Basel, Basel, Switzerland"

Notably, the function of TRPA1 depends on Ca2, with low Ca2 potentiating and high Ca2 inactivating TRPA1. However, it remains unknown how Ca2 exerts such contrasting effects. Here, we show that Ca2 regulates TRPA1 through calmodulin, which binds to TRPA1 in a Ca2dependent manner. Calmodulin binding enhanced TRPA1 sensitivity and Ca2evoked potentiation of TRPA1 at low Ca2, but inhibited TRPA1 sensitivity and promoted TRPA1 desensitization at high Ca2. Ca2dependent potentiation and inactivation of TRPA1 were selectively prevented by disrupting the interaction of the carboxylobe of calmodulin with a calmodulinbinding domain in the Cterminus of TRPA1. Calmodulin is thus a critical Ca2 sensor enabling TRPA1 to respond to diverse Ca2 signals distinctly.",Raquibul Hasan; Alasdair T. S. LeesonPayne; Jonathan H.

The biochip can also be adapted to enumerate other specific cell types such as somatic cells or cells from tissue or liquid biopsies. Capture of other specific cells requires immobilization of their corresponding antibodies within the capture chamber.

Here, we present data from independent largescale clinical data sets (including 29 557 cases and 32 056 controls) revealing brain expressed protocadherin 17 (PCDH17) as a susceptibility gene for major mood disorders. Singlenucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) spanning the PCDH17 region are significantly associated with major mood disorders; subjects carrying the risk allele showed impaired cognitive abilities, increased vulnerable personality features, decreased amygdala volume and altered amygdala function as compared with noncarriers. The risk allele predicted higher transcriptional levels of PCDH17 mRNA in postmortem brain samples, which is consistent with increased gene expression in patients with bipolar disorder compared with healthy subjects. Further, overexpression of PCDH17 in primary cortical neurons revealed significantly decreased spine density and abnormal dendritic morphology compared with control groups, which again is consistent with the clinical observations of reduced numbers of dendritic spines in the brains of patients with major mood disorders. Given that synaptic spines are dynamic structures which regulate neuronal plasticity and have crucial roles in myriad brain functions, this study reveals a potential underlying biological mechanism of a novel risk gene for major mood disorders involved in synaptic function and related intermediate phenotypes.",H Chang; N Hoshina; C Zhang; Y Ma; H Cao; Y Wang; Dd Wu; S E Bergen; M Landen; C M Hultman; M Preisig; Z Kutalik; E Castelao; M GrigoroiuSerbanescu; A J Forstner; J Strohmaier; J Hecker; T G Schulze; B MullerMyhsok; A Reif; P B Mitchell; N G Martin; P R Schofield; S Cichon; M M Nothen; H Walter; S Erk; A Heinz; N Amin; C M van Duijn; A MeyerLindenberg; H Tost; X Xiao; T Yamamoto; M Rietschel; M Li,Bipolar disorder; Depression; Genetics; Neuroscience,"Key Laboratory of Animal Models and Human Disease Mechanisms of the Chinese Academy of Sciences and Yunnan Province, Kunming Institute of Zoology, Kunming, China; Cell Signal Unit, Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology Graduate University, Okinawa, Japan; Department of Neurology, F.M.

Efficacy of vaccines is often compromised due to the rapid emergence of antigenic variants. To improve the effectiveness of vaccines in the field, a better understanding of the antigenic epitopes of the major antigen, hemagglutinin, is required. To address this, a panel of nine monoclonal antibodies were generated against a contemporary Pakistani H9N2 isolate, which represents a major Asian H9N2 viral lineage. Antibodies were characterized in detail and used to select a total of 26 unique 'escape' mutants with substitutions across nine different amino acid residues in hemagglutinin including seven that have not been described as antigenic determinants for H9N2 viruses before. Competition assays and structural mapping revealed two novel, discrete antigenic sites ""H9A"" and ""H9B"". Additionally, a second subset of escape mutants contained amino acid deletions within the hemagglutinin receptor binding site. This constitutes a novel method of escape for group 1 hemagglutinins and could represent an alternative means for H9N2 viruses to overcome vaccine induced immunity.

When such features are appropriately structured, electromagnetic radiation can be manipulated in unusual ways, resulting in optical metamaterials whose function is directly controlled through nanoscale structure. Nature, too, has adopted such techniquesfor example in the unique colouring of butterfly wingsto manipulate photons as they propagate through nanoscale periodic assemblies. In this Perspective, we highlight the intriguing potential of designer structuring of electronic matter at scales at and below the electron wavelength, which affords a new range of synthetic quantum metamaterials with unconventional responses. Driven by experimental developments in stacking atomically layered heterostructuressuch as mechanical pickuptransfer assemblyatomicscale registrations and structures can be readily tuned over distances smaller than characteristic electronic length scales (such as the electron wavelength, screening length and electron mean free path). Yet electronic metamaterials promise far richer categories of behaviour than those found in conventional optical metamaterial technologies. This is because, unlike photons, which scarcely interact with each other, electrons in subwavelengthstructured metamaterials are charged and strongly interact. As a result, an enormous variety of emergent phenomena can be expected and radically new classes of interacting quantum metamaterials designed.

Before cells can replicate their DNA in S phase, they have to activate cyclindependent kinases (CDKs), induce an E2F transcription program and inactivate the anaphasepromoting complex (APCCCDH1, also known as the cyclosome), which is an E3 ubiquitin ligase that contains the coactivator CDH1 (also known as FZR, encoded by FZR1). It was recently shown that stress can return cells to quiescence after CDK2 activation and E2F induction but not after inactivation of APCCCDH1, which suggests that APCCCDH1 inactivation is the point of no return for cellcycle entry
                  3
                . Rapid inactivation of APCCCDH1 requires early mitotic inhibitor 1 (EMI1)3,5, but the molecular mechanism that controls this cellcycle commitment step is unknown. Here we show using human cell models that cellcycle commitment is mediated by an EMI1APCCCDH1 dualnegative feedback switch, in which EMI1 is both a substrate and an inhibitor of APCCCDH1. The inactivation switch triggers a transition between a state with low EMI1 levels and high APCCCDH1 activity during G1 and a state with high EMI1 levels and low APCCCDH1 activity during S and G2. Cellbased analysis, in vitro reconstitution and modelling data show that the underlying dualnegative feedback is bistable and represents a robust irreversible switch. Our study suggests that mammalian cells commit to the cell cycle by increasing CDK2 activity and EMI1 mRNA expression to trigger a oneway APCCCDH1 inactivation switch that is mediated by EMI1 transitioning from acting as a substrate of APCCCDH1 to being an inhibitor of APCCCDH1. The transition between early mitotic inhibitor 1 acting as a substrate of the APCC and as an inhibitor of the same complex results in an irreversible switch that mediates human cellcycle commitment.",Steven D.

Antibodies are clearly critical for control of this deadly disease; however, the specific mechanisms of action of protective antibodies have yet to be defined. In this Perspective we discuss the antibody features that correlate with in vivo protection during infection with Ebola virus, based on the results of a systematic and comprehensive study of antibodies directed against this virus. Although neutralization activity mediated by the Fab domains of the antibody is strongly correlated with protection, recruitment of immune effector functions by the Fc domain has also emerged as a complementary, and sometimes alternative, route to protection. For a subset of antibodies, Fcmediated clearance and killing of infected cells seems to be the main driver of protection after exposure and mirrors observations in vaccination studies. Continued analysis of antibodies that achieve protection partially or wholly through Fcmediated functions, the precise functions required, the intersection with specificity and the importance of these functions in different animal models is needed to identify and begin to capitalize on Fcmediated protection in vaccines and therapeutics alike. Saphire and colleagues provide new insight into protective antibodymediated responses to Ebola virus and how these responses could be harnessed for therapeutic intervention and vaccine strategies.",Erica Ollmann Saphire; Sharon L.

IKZF1 deficiency also reduces plasmacytoid dendritic cell (pDC) numbers in mice, but its effects on human DC development are unknown. Here we show that heterozygous mutation of IKZF1 in human decreases pDC numbers and expands conventional DC1 (cDC1). Lenalidomide, a drug that induces proteosomal degradation of IKZF1, also decreases pDC numbers in vivo, and reduces the ratio of pDCcDC1 differentiated from progenitor cells in vitro in a dosedependent manner. In addition, nonclassical monocytes are reduced by IKZF1 deficiency in vivo. DC and monocytes from patients with IKZF1 deficiency or lenalidomidetreated cultures secrete less IFN, TNF and IL12. These results indicate that human DC development and function are regulated by IKZF1, providing further insights into the consequences of IKZF1 mutation on immune function and the mechanism of immunomodulation by lenalidomide. IKZF1 is a transcription factor known to regulate mammalian Bcell development.

Here, we demonstrate that deletion of Tgfbr2 in adult postnatal microglia does neither result in impairment of the microgliaspecific gene expression signatures, nor is microglial survival and maintenance affected. Tgfbr2deficient microglia were characterised by distinct morphological changes and transcriptome analysis using RNAseq revealed that loss of TGF signalling results in upregulation of microglia activation and priming markers. Moreover, protein arrays demonstrated increased secretion of CXCL10 and CCL2 accompanied by activation of immune cell signalling as evidenced by increased phosphorylation of TAK1. Together, these data underline the importance of microglial TGF signalling to regulate microglia adaptive changes. While previous studies had shown the requirement of TGF signalling in microglia gene expression, the specificity of the lossoffunction was unclear. Here, Zoller and colleagues generate microglia specific cKO of TGF receptor 2, and show dispensable function of Tgfbr2 in microglial survival and the requirement of Tgfbr2 in morphological and transcriptional homeostasis of adult microglia.",Tanja Zoller; Artur Schneider; Christian Kleimeyer; Takahiro Masuda; Phani Sankar Potru; Dietmar Pfeifer; Thomas Blank; Marco Prinz; Bjorn Spittau,Glial biology; Microglia; Neuroimmunology; Neuroscience,"Institute for Anatomy and Cell Biology, Department of Molecular Embryology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany; Faculty of Biology, University of Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany; Institute for Anatomy and Cell Biology, Department of Molecular Embryology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany; Institute for Anatomy and Cell Biology, Department of Molecular Embryology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany; Institute of Neuropathology, Medical CenterUniversity of Freiburg, Faculty of Medicine, University of Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany; Faculty of Biology, University of Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany; Institute of Anatomy, University of Rostock, Rostock, Germany; Department of HematologyOncology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany; Institute of Neuropathology, Medical CenterUniversity of Freiburg, Faculty of Medicine, University of Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany; Institute of Neuropathology, Medical CenterUniversity of Freiburg, Faculty of Medicine, University of Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany; BIOSS Centre for Biological Signalling Studies, University of Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany; Institute for Anatomy and Cell Biology, Department of Molecular Embryology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany; Institute of Anatomy, University of Rostock, Rostock, Germany"

Our aim was to identify gut microbiotametabolomics signatures preceding dementia in genetically prone (3xtg) mice, with and without superimposed highfat diet. We examined the composition and diversity of their gut microbiota, and serum and faecal metabolites. 3xtg mice showed brain hypometabolism typical of predemented stage, and lacked the physiological bacterial diversity between caecum and colon seen in controls. Cluster analyses revealed distinct profiles of microbiota, and serum and fecal metabolome across groups. Elevation in FirmicutestoBacteroidetes abundance, and exclusive presence of Turicibacteraceae, Christensenellaceae, Anaeroplasmataceae and Ruminococcaceae, and lack of Bifidobacteriaceae, were also observed. Metabolome analysis revealed a deficiency in unsaturated fatty acids and choline, and an overabundance in ketone bodies, lactate, amino acids, TMA and TMAO in 3xtg mice, with additive effects of highfat diet. These metabolic alterations were correlated with high prevalence of Enterococcaceae, Staphylococcus, Roseburia, Coprobacillus and Dorea, and low prevalence of S24.7, rc4.4 and Bifidobacterium, which in turn related to cognitive impairment and cerebral hypometabolism. Our results indicate an effect of transgenic background on gut microbiomemetabolome, enhanced by highfat diet.

We demonstrate that although genomic G  C composition is strongly driven by mutation bias, it is also substantially modified by direct selection andor as a byproduct of biased gene conversion. Moreover, G  C composition at fourfold redundant sites is consistently elevated above the neutral expectationmore so than for any other class of sites.

25aa76f399384b70ba2b4448f4dc2a61,Multipartite viruses: adaptive trick or evolutionary treat?,"Multipartitism counts amongst the weirdest lifestyles found in the virosphere. Multipartite viruses have genomes segmented in pieces enclosed in different capsids that are independently transmitted. Since all segments have to meet in the host for complementation and completion of the viral cycle, multipartite viruses are bound to fight the loss of genomic information. While this is an obvious disadvantage of this strategy, no consensus on its actual advantages has been reached. In this review we present an exhaustive summary of all multipartite viruses described to date. Based on evidence, we discuss possible mechanistic and evolutionary origins of different groups, as well as their mutual relationships. We argue that the ubiquitous interactions of viruses with other unrelated viruses and with subviral elements might be regarded as a plausible first step towards multipartitism. In agreement with the view of the Virosphere as a deeply entangled network of gene sharing, we contend that the power of multipartitism relies on its dynamical and opportunistic nature, because it enables immediate adaptive responses to environmental changes. As such, perhaps the reasons for its success should be shought in multipartitism itself as an adaptive mechanism, to which its evolutionarily shortlived products (that is, the extant ensemble of multipartite viral species) are subordinated. We close by discussing how our understanding of multipartitism would improve by using concepts and tools from systems biology. The faithful transmission of the genome of an organism is a fundamental step to preserve information essential for survivability. However, multipartite viruses thrive with segmented genomes that propagate in independent viral particles. Though this adaptive strategy appears as counterintuitive and suboptimal, multipartitism is common in the viral world and has very likely arisen several times. Here we review the distribution and abundance of multipartite viruses and discuss possible evolutionary pathways for their emergence. Though no clear advantage of multipartitism has been identified, we suggest that the high prevalence of this strategy relies on its dynamic and opportunistic nature, and that it can only be understood in an ecological context. A systems biology perspective could help understanding some of the open questions regarding this weird lifestyle, while multipartitism could in turn inspire design principles based on the simultaneous exploration of an exploding number of transient collaborative associations.",Adriana LuciaSanz; Susanna Manrubia,Dynamic networks; Evolution; Population dynamics,"Grupo Interdisciplinar de Sistemas Complejos (GISC), National Centre for Biotechnology (CSIC), Madrid, Spain; Grupo Interdisciplinar de Sistemas Complejos (GISC), National Centre for Biotechnology (CSIC), Madrid, Spain"
ffd90896178649db95d9dd4e3e97d55f,Cellulosebased magnetoelectric composites,"Since the first magnetoelectric polymer composites were fabricated more than a decade ago, there has been a reluctance to use piezoelectric polymers other than poly(vinylidene fluoride) and its copolymers due to their welldefined piezoelectric mechanism and high piezoelectric coefficients that lead to superior magnetoelectric coefficients of 1 V cm1 Oe1. This is the current situation despite the potential for other piezoelectric polymers, such as natural biopolymers, to bring unique, addedvalue properties and functions to magnetoelectric composite devices. Here we demonstrate a cellulosebased magnetoelectric laminate composite that produces considerable magnetoelectric coefficients of 1.5 V cm1 Oe1, comprising a Fano resonance that is ubiquitous in the field of physics, such as photonics, though never experimentally observed in magnetoelectric composites. The work successfully demonstrates the concept of exploring new advances in using biopolymers in magnetoelectric composites, particularly cellulose, which is increasingly employed as a renewable, lowcost, easily processable and degradable material. Magnetoelectric materials by converting a magnetic input to a voltage output holds promise in contactless electrodes that find applications from energy harvesting to sensing.

We utilized immunofluorescence approaches to study mTOR cellular distribution and proteinprotein colocalisation in human skeletal muscle in the basal state as well as immediately, 1 and 3 h after an acute bout of resistance exercise in a fed (FED; 20 g Protein40 g carbohydrate1 g fat) or energyfree control (CON) state. mTOR and the lysosomal protein LAMP2 were highly colocalised in basal samples. Resistance exercise resulted in rapid translocation of mTORLAMP2 towards the cell membrane. Concurrently, resistance exercise led to the dissociation of TSC2 from Rheb and increased in the colocalisation of mTOR and Rheb post exercise in both FED and CON. In addition, mTOR colocalised with Eukaryotic translation initiation factor 3 subunit F (eIF3F) at the cell membrane postexercise in both groups, with the response significantly greater at 1 h of recovery in the FED compared to CON. Collectively our data demonstrate that cellular trafficking of mTOR occurs in human muscle in response to an anabolic stimulus, events that appear to be primarily influenced by muscle contraction. The translocation and association of mTOR with positive regulators (i.e. Rheb and eIF3F) is consistent with an enhanced mRNA translational capacity after resistance exercise.",Zhe Song; Daniel R.

Recently, a rich variety of highfield magnetotransport properties in the regime of high electron densities (1019 cm3) were reported, which can be related to additional twodimensional layered conductivity, hampering the identification of the topological surface states. Here, we report that quantum corrections to the electronic conduction are dominated by the surface states for a semiconducting case, which can be analyzed by the HikamiLarkinNagaoka model for two coupled surfaces in the case of strong spinorbit interaction. However, in the metalliclike case this analysis fails and additional twodimensional contributions need to be accounted for. Shubnikovde Haas oscillations and quantized Hall resistance prove as strong indications for the twodimensional layered metallic behavior. Temperaturedependent magnetotransport properties of highquality Bi2Se3 single crystalline exfoliated macro and micro flakes are combined with high resolution transmission electron microscopy and energydispersive xray spectroscopy, confirming the structure and stoichiometry.

Mutations in POLG can cause early childhood mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) depletion syndromes or lateronset syndromes arising from mtDNA deletions. POLG mutations are the most common cause of inherited mitochondrial disorders, with as many as 2% of the population carrying these mutations. POLGrelated disorders comprise a continuum of overlapping phenotypes with onset from infancy to late adulthood. The six leading disorders caused by POLG mutations are AlpersHuttenlocher syndrome, which is one of the most severe phenotypes; childhood myocerebrohepatopathy spectrum, which presents within the first 3 years of life; myoclonic epilepsy myopathy sensory ataxia; ataxia neuropathy spectrum; autosomal recessive progressive external ophthalmoplegia; and autosomal dominant progressive external ophthalmoplegia. This Review describes the clinical features, pathophysiology, natural history and treatment of POLGrelated disorders, focusing particularly on the neurological manifestations of these conditions. Pathogenic variants in POLG, which encodes the catalytic subunit of DNA polymerase , cause a spectrum of overlapping disease phenotypes.

Type I cryoglobulinaemia consists of only one isotype or subclass of monoclonal immunoglobulin, whereas type II and type III are classified as mixed cryoglobulinaemia because they include immunoglobulin G (IgG) and IgM. Many lymphoproliferative, infectious and autoimmune disorders have been associated with mixed cryoglobulinaemia; however, hepatitis C virus (HCV) is the aetiologic agent in most patients. The underlying mechanism of the disorder is B cell lymphoproliferation and autoantibody production. Mixed cryoglobulinaemia can cause systemic vasculitis, with manifestations ranging from purpura, arthralgia and weakness to more serious lesions with skin ulcers, neurological and renal involvement. This Primer focuses on mixed cryoglobulinaemia, which has a variable course and a prognosis that is primarily influenced by vasculitisassociated multiorgan damage. In addition, the underlying associated disease in itself may cause considerable mortality and morbidity. Treatment of cryoglobulinaemic vasculitis should be modulated according to the underlying associated disease and the severity of organ involvement and relies on antiviral treatment (for HCV infection), immunosuppression and immunotherapy, particularly antiCD20 B cell depletion therapies.

It was demonstrated that the plasma and saliva concentrations of all immunemediators analyzed were significantly related across the sociocognitive stress. In addition, when there was a close correlation to AE, the anger state, the IL1, the IL18 salivary and plasmatic concentrations were significantly higher, while they decreased during the AE. On the other hand, the anxiety state and the IL6 levels significantly increased throughout the AE. The IL1 and IL6 were positively associated to the anger and the anxiety state, respectively.

Although pathogen access to the brain parenchyma and retina is generally restricted by physiological and immunological barriers, certain pathogens may breach these barriers. In the CNS, such pathogens may either cause devastating inflammation or benefit from immune privilege in the CNS, where they are largely protected from the peripheral immune system. Thus, some pathogens can persist as latent infections and later be reactivated. We review the consequences of immune privilege in the context of CNS infections and ask whether immune privilege may provide protection for certain pathogens and promote their latency. Traditionally, the CNS is described to have immune privilege, largely because of its immunological barriers. Here, Forrester, McMenamin and Dando describe how this immune privilege may sometimes not be beneficial, as it enables invading pathogens to exist as latent CNS infections.",John V.

0b11d1dec59243109eb61b1201008f3d,Evolution of sequencedefined highly functionalized nucleic acid polymers,"The evolution of sequencedefined synthetic polymers made of building blocks beyond those compatible with polymerase enzymes or the ribosome has the potential to generate new classes of receptors, catalysts and materials. Here we describe a ligasemediated DNAtemplated polymerization and in vitro selection system to evolve highly functionalized nucleic acid polymers (HFNAPs) made from 32 building blocks that contain eight chemically diverse side chains on a DNA backbone. Through iterated cycles of polymer translation, selection and reverse translation, we discovered HFNAPs that bind proprotein convertase subtilisinkexin type 9 (PCSK9) and interleukin6, two protein targets implicated in human diseases. Mutation and reselection of an active PCSK9binding polymer yielded evolved polymers with high affinity (KD  3 nM). This evolved polymer potently inhibited the binding between PCSK9 and the lowdensity lipoprotein receptor. Structureactivity relationship studies revealed that specific side chains at defined positions in the polymers are required for binding to their respective targets. Our findings expand the chemical space of evolvable polymers to include densely functionalized nucleic acids with diverse, researcherdefined chemical repertoires. A method to produce sequencedefined, diversely functionalized nucleic acid polymers that bind to proteins of biomedical interest has been developed. The method is based on a ligasemediated, DNAtemplated polymerization system and in vitro selection. The selected polymers are shown to bind their targets in a manner that is strongly dependent on specific side chains at certain polymer positions.

However, random crystal orientations and low conductivity can result in poor performance. Designing a convenient method to address these issues is therefore an important challenge. Here we describe an efficient strategy to fabricate selfsupported MOF walllike architectures with uniform orientation on carbon nanowalls (CNWs) as seedbeds. In addition, we gain molecularlevel insight into the interface between CNWs and MOF nanosheets using density functional theory calculations. Our results suggest that assembled ions anchor on edge carbon atoms to match the matrix of the edges of CNWs, while the remaining ions selfassemble with terminal COOH groups on pbenzenedicarboxylic acid ligands to form the structure. Our findings demonstrate a feasible method to fabricate integrated MOF electrodes with ideal orientations and, therefore, may pave the way to unlock the inherent high performance of MOF materials towards a number of engineering applications. Metalorganic frameworks are candidates for future energy storage materials, but are limited by poor conductivity and random crystal orientation on current collectors.

SCC comprises a wide range of tumours originated from diverse anatomical locations that share common genetic mutations and expression of squamous differentiation markers. SCCs arise from squamous and nonsquamous epithelial tissues. Here, we discuss the different studies in which the cell of origin of SCCs has been uncovered by expressing oncogenes andor deleting tumour suppressor genes in the different cell lineages that compose these epithelia. We present evidence showing that the squamous differentiation phenotype of the tumour depends on the type of mutated oncogene and the cell of origin, which dictate the competence of the cells to initiate SCC formation, as well as on the aggressiveness and invasive properties of these tumours. This Review discusses the origins of squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), with a focus on skin, lung, oesophageal and head and neck cancer, and describes how oncogenic mutations and the cell of origin cooperate in determining the rise of SCC.",Adriana SanchezDanes; Cedric Blanpain,Cancer genetics; Differentiation; Head and neck cancer; Lineage tracking; Lung cancer; Oesophageal cancer; Skin cancer; Squamous cell carcinoma; Stem cells,"Universite Libre de Bruxelles, Laboratory of Stem Cells and Cancer, Brussels, Belgium; Universite Libre de Bruxelles, Laboratory of Stem Cells and Cancer, Brussels, Belgium; WELBIO, Universite Libre de Bruxelles, Brussels, Belgium"

These nonneuronal cells are crucial in determining the functional interactions of specific neuronal subpopulations involved in the control of metabolism. Recent advances in biology, optics, genetics, and pharmacology have resulted in the emergence of novel and highly sophisticated approaches for studying hypothalamic neuronalglial networks. Here we summarize the progress in the field and argue that glialneuronal interactions provide a core hub integrating foodrelated cues, interoceptive signals, and internal states to adapt a complex set of physiological responses operating on different timescales to finely tune behavior and metabolism according to metabolic status. This expanding knowledge helps to redefine our understanding of the physiology of food intake and energy metabolism.

b98f9de64a8c4fea9ca224ee31bc5fd0,The global biogeography of polyploid plants,"Deciphering the global distribution of polyploid plants is fundamental for understanding plant evolution and ecology. Many factors have been hypothesized to affect the uneven distribution of polyploid plants across the globe. Nevertheless, the lack of large comparative datasets has restricted such studies to local floras and to narrow taxonomical scopes, limiting our understanding of the underlying drivers of polyploid plant distribution. We present a map portraying the worldwide polyploid frequencies, based on extensive spatial data coupled with phylogenybased polyploidy inference for tens of thousands of species. This allowed us to assess the potential global drivers affecting polyploid distribution. Our data reveal a clear latitudinal trend, with polyploid frequency increasing away from the equator. Climate, especially temperature, appears to be the most influential predictor of polyploid distribution. However, we find this effect to be mostly indirect, mediated predominantly by variation in plant lifeforms and, to a lesser extent, by taxonomical composition and species richness. Thus, our study presents an emerging view of polyploid distribution that highlights attributes that facilitate the establishment of new polyploid lineages by providing polyploids with sufficient time (that is, perenniality) and space (low species richness) to compete with preadapted diploid relatives.",Anna Rice; Petr Smarda; Maria Novosolov; Michal Drori; Lior Glick; Niv Sabath; Shai Meiri; Jonathan Belmaker; Itay Mayrose,Plant ecology; Plant evolution,"School of Plant Sciences and Food Security, TelAviv University, TelAviv, Israel; Department of Botany and Zoology, Masaryk University, Brno, Czech Republic; School of Zoology, TelAviv University, TelAviv, Israel; Steinhardt Museum of Natural History, TelAviv University, TelAviv, Israel; School of Plant Sciences and Food Security, TelAviv University, TelAviv, Israel; School of Plant Sciences and Food Security, TelAviv University, TelAviv, Israel; School of Plant Sciences and Food Security, TelAviv University, TelAviv, Israel; School of Zoology, TelAviv University, TelAviv, Israel; Steinhardt Museum of Natural History, TelAviv University, TelAviv, Israel; School of Zoology, TelAviv University, TelAviv, Israel; Steinhardt Museum of Natural History, TelAviv University, TelAviv, Israel; School of Plant Sciences and Food Security, TelAviv University, TelAviv, Israel"

Perturbation experiments with microbial populations have supported this hypothesis under controlled laboratory conditions, but evidence from natural ecosystems remains rare. Here, we manipulated rocky intertidal canopy algae to test the hypothesis that the spatial scale at which the system recovers from a perturbation in space should increase as the system approaches the tipping point, marking the transition from a canopydominated to a turfdominated state. Empirical estimates of recovery length, a recently proposed spatial indicator of an approaching tipping point, were obtained by comparing the spatial scale at which algal turfs propagated into canopydegraded regions with decreasing canopy cover. We show that recovery length increased along the gradient in canopy degradation, providing fieldbased evidence of spatial signatures of critical slowing down in natural conditions. Spatial indicators of ecosystemcritical transitions have so far only been confirmed in the lab. Here, the authors show that increasing recovery length provides a spatial signature of critical slowing down in a natural intertidal community.",Luca Rindi; Martina Dal Bello; Lei Dai; Jeff Gore; Lisandro BenedettiCecchi,Ecology; Marine biology,"Department of Biology, University of Pisa, CoNISMa, Pisa 56126, Italy; Department of Biology, University of Pisa, CoNISMa, Pisa 56126, Italy; Present address: Physics of Living Systems, Department of Physics, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, 400 Technology Square, NE46609, Cambridge, Massachusetts 02139, USA.,

In this paper, honokiol (HK) and doxorubicin (Dox) coloaded Methoxy poly(ethylene glycol)poly(caprolactone) (MPEGPCL) nanoparticles were prepared with a assembly method. The particle size (about 34 nm), morphology, Xray Powder Diffraction (XRD), in vitro release profile, cytotoxicity and cell proliferation effects were studied in detail. The results indicated that honokiol and doxorubicin could be efficiently loaded into MPEGPCL nanoparticles simultaneously, and could be released from the micelles in an extended period in vitro. In addition, honokiol and doxorubicin loaded in MPEGPCL nanoparticles could efficiently suppress glioma cell proliferation and induce cell apoptosis in vitro. Furthermore, DoxHKMPEGPCL micelles inhibited glioma growth more significantly than DoxMPEGPCL and HKMPEGPCL in both nude mice and zebrafish tumor models. Immunohistochemical analysis indicated that DOXHKMPEGPCL micelles improved Dox's antitumor effect by enhancing tumor cell apoptosis, suppressing tumor cell proliferation, and inhibiting angiogenesis.

Although neuropathological abnormalities have been detected in the olfactory bulb (OB), little is known about its dynamic biology. Here, OB proteome analysis showed a stagedependent synaptic proteostasis impairment during AD evolution. In addition to progressive modulation of tau and amyloid precursor protein (APP) interactomes, networkdriven proteomics revealed an early disruption of upstream and downstream p38 MAPK pathway and a subsequent impairment of Phosphoinositidedependent protein kinase 1 (PDK1)Protein kinase C (PKC) signaling axis in the OB from AD subjects. Moreover, a mitochondrial imbalance was evidenced by a depletion of Prohibitin2 (Phb2) levels and a specific decrease in the phosphorylated isoforms of Phb1 in intermediate and advanced AD stages. Interestingly, olfactory Phb subunits were also deregulated across different types of dementia. Phb2 showed a specific upregulation in mixed dementia, while Phb1 isoforms were downregulated in frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD). However, no differences were observed in the olfactory expression of Phb subunits in progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP).

8ea702df9ed6425cbe92777d5747d802,Contribution of reactive oxygen species to thymineless death in Escherichia coli,"Nutrient starvation usually halts cell growth rather than causing death. Thymine starvation is exceptional, because it kills cells rapidly. This phenomenon, called thymineless death (TLD), underlies the action of several antibacterial, antimalarial, anticancer, and immunomodulatory agents. Many explanations for TLD have been advanced, with recent efforts focused on recombination proteins and replication origin (oriC) degradation. Because current proposals account for only part of TLD and because reactive oxygen species (ROS) are implicated in bacterial death due to other forms of harsh stress, we investigated the possible involvement of ROS in TLD. Here, we show that thymine starvation leads to accumulation of both singlestranded DNA regions and intracellular ROS, and interference with either event protects bacteria from doublestranded DNA breakage and TLD. Elevated levels of singlestranded DNA were necessary but insufficient for TLD, whereas reduction of ROS to background levels largely abolished TLD. We conclude that ROS contribute to TLD by converting singlestranded DNA lesions into doublestranded DNA breaks. Participation of ROS in the terminal phases of TLD provides a specific example of how ROS contribute to stressmediated bacterial selfdestruction. Thymine starvation generates singlestranded DNA regions and reactive oxygen species, leading to DNA breakage and cell death.",Yuzhi Hong; Liping Li; Gan Luan; Karl Drlica; Xilin Zhao,Antimicrobials; Bacterial physiology; Cell death; DNA metabolism; Doublestrand DNA breaks,"Public Health Research Institute and Department of Microbiology, Biochemistry  Molecular Genetics, New Jersey Medical School, Rutgers University, Newark, USA; Public Health Research Institute and Department of Microbiology, Biochemistry  Molecular Genetics, New Jersey Medical School, Rutgers University, Newark, USA; Public Health Research Institute and Department of Microbiology, Biochemistry  Molecular Genetics, New Jersey Medical School, Rutgers University, Newark, USA; Public Health Research Institute and Department of Microbiology, Biochemistry  Molecular Genetics, New Jersey Medical School, Rutgers University, Newark, USA; Public Health Research Institute and Department of Microbiology, Biochemistry  Molecular Genetics, New Jersey Medical School, Rutgers University, Newark, USA; State Key Laboratory of Molecular Vaccinology and Molecular Diagnostics, School of Public Health, Xiamen University, Xiamen, China"

The visual cortex is one of the main stages in the mammalian nervous system in which the direction of motion may be computed de novo. Experiments and theories indicate that cortical neurons respond selectively to motion direction by combining inputs that provide information about distinct spatial locations with distinct time delays. Despite the importance of this spatiotemporal offset for direction selectivity, its origin and cellular mechanisms are not fully understood. We show that approximately 80  10 thalamic neurons, which respond with distinct time courses to stimuli in distinct locations, excite mouse visual cortical neurons during visual stimulation. The integration of thalamic inputs with the appropriate spatiotemporal offset provides cortical neurons with a primordial bias for direction selectivity. These data show how cortical neurons selectively combine the spatiotemporal response diversity of thalamic neurons to extract fundamental features of the visual world. Direction selectivity emerges de novo in layer 4 neurons of primary visual cortex through the convergence of synaptic inputs from thalamic neurons that respond with distinct time courses to visual stimuli in distinct locations.",Anthony D.

Most energy storage and conversion technologies for renewables rely on electrocatalytic processes and, with increasing availability of cheap electrical energy from renewables, chemical production will witness electrification in the near future13. However, our fundamental understanding of electrocatalysis lags behind the field of classical heterogeneous catalysis that has been the dominating chemical technology for a long time. Here, we describe a new strategy to advance fundamental studies on electrocatalytic materials. We propose to 'electrify' complex oxidebased model catalysts made by surface science methods to explore electrocatalytic reactions in liquid electrolytes. We demonstrate the feasibility of this concept by transferring an atomically defined platinumcobalt oxide model catalyst into the electrochemical environment while preserving its atomic surface structure. Using this approach, we explore particle size effects and identify hitherto unknown metalsupport interactions that stabilize oxidized platinum at the nanoparticle interface. The metalsupport interactions open a new synergistic reaction pathway that involves both metallic and oxidized platinum. Our results illustrate the potential of the concept, which makes available a systematic approach to build atomically defined model electrodes for fundamental electrocatalytic studies.

However, until the discovery of Homo floresiensis in 2003, claims of the presence of archaic hominins on Wallacean islands were hypothetical owing to the absence of in situ fossils andor stone artefacts that were excavated from welldocumented stratigraphic contexts, or because secure numerical dating methods of these sites were lacking. As a consequence, these claims were generally treated with scepticism
                  5
                . Here we describe the results of recent excavations at Kalinga in the Cagayan Valley of northern Luzon in the Philippines that have yielded 57 stone tools associated with an almostcomplete disarticulated skeleton of Rhinoceros philippinensis, which shows clear signs of butchery, together with other fossil fauna remains attributed to stegodon, Philippine brown deer, freshwater turtle and monitor lizard. All finds originate from a clayrich bone bed that was dated to between 777 and 631 thousand years ago using electronspin resonance methods that were applied to tooth enamel and fluvial quartz. This evidence pushes back the proven period of colonization

                 of the Philippines by hundreds of thousands of years, and furthermore suggests that early overseas dispersal in Island South East Asia by premodern hominins took place several times during the Early and Middle Pleistocene stages14.

However, few systems have capitalized on recent breakthroughs in computer vision and realtime control to enable a twoway interaction between the animal and the robot. Here, we present a ""closedloop control"" system to investigate the behaviour of zebrafish, a popular animal model in preclinical studies. The system allows for actuating a biologicallyinspired 3Dprinted replica in a 3D workspace, in response to the behaviour of a zebrafish. We demonstrate the role of closedloop control in modulating the response of zebrafish, across a range of behavioural and informationtheoretic measures. Our results suggest that closedloop control could enhance the degree of biomimicry of the replica, by increasing the attraction of live subjects and their interaction with the stimulus. Interactive experiments hold promise to advance our understanding of zebrafish, offering new means for high throughput behavioural phenotyping.",Changsu Kim; Tommaso Ruberto; Paul Phamduy; Maurizio Porfiri,Animal behaviour; Biomimetics; Mechanical engineering,"Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering, New York University Tandon School of Engineering, Brooklyn, New York, USA; Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering, New York University Tandon School of Engineering, Brooklyn, New York, USA; Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering, New York University Tandon School of Engineering, Brooklyn, New York, USA; Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering, New York University Tandon School of Engineering, Brooklyn, New York, USA"
efb65a8a495f43cf9dcd5c41dc373be3,Rational design of a trispecific antibody targeting the HIV1 Env with elevated antiviral activity,"HIV1 broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs) are being explored as passively administered therapeutic and preventative agents. However, the extensively diversified HIV1 envelope glycoproteins (Env) rapidly acquire mutations to evade individual bNAbs in monotherapy regimens. The use of a ""single"" agent to simultaneously target distinct Env epitopes is desirable to overcome viral diversity. Here, we report the use of tandem singlechain variable fragment (ScFv) domains of two bNAbs, specific for the CD4binding site and V3 glycan patch, to form antiHIV1 bispecific ScFvs (BiScFvs). The optimal BiScFv crosslinks adjacent protomers within one HIV1 Env spike and has greater neutralization breadth than its parental bNAbs. Furthermore, the combination of this BiScFv with a third bNAb recognizing the Env membrane proximal external region (MPER) results in a trispecific bNAb, which has nearly panisolate neutralization breadth and high potency. Thus, multispecific antibodies combining functional moieties of bNAbs could achieve outstanding neutralization capacity with augmented avidity. Broadly neutralizing antibodies targeting HIV Env could potentially be utilized as therapeutics. Here, Steinhardt et al. engineer a trispecific antibody with specificity for the receptorbinding site, a conserved Env glycan patch and the Env membrane proximal region with nearly panisolate neutralization breadth and high potency.",James J.

Here we use Cas9 nucleaseinduced doublestrand break DNA (DSB) at the UROS locus to model and correct congenital erythropoietic porphyria. We demonstrate that homologydirected repair is rare compared with NHEJ pathway leading to ontarget indels and causing unwanted dysfunctional protein. Moreover, we describe unexpected chromosomal truncations resulting from only one Cas9 nucleaseinduced DSB in cell lines and primary cells by a p53dependent mechanism. Altogether, these side effects may limit the promising perspectives of the CRISPRCas9 nuclease system for disease modeling and gene therapy. We show that the single nickase approach could be safer since it prevents on and offtarget indels and chromosomal truncations. These results demonstrate that the single nickase and not the nuclease approach is preferable, not only for modeling disease but also and more importantly for the safe management of future CRISPRCas9mediated gene therapies. CRISPRCas9 has been rapidly adopted to generate cell line models of disease.

Manmade fibrillar hydrogels can function as biomimetic materials to reproduce the filamentous nature and properties of ECMs and to serve as scaffolds for 3D cell culture and tissue engineering. Different types of synthetic nanofibrillar hydrogels have been developed, with diverse mechanisms of assembly and a variety of physical properties and applications. In this Review, we explore the design and properties of biomimetic manmade nanofibrillar hydrogels. We discuss the assembly of peptides, block copolymer wormlike micelles and filamentous nanoparticles into fibrillar hydrogels and investigate the relationship between structure and physical as well as biochemical properties. Potential applications for 3D cell culture and tissue engineering are examined, and the properties and structure of natural and manmade fibrillar hydrogels are compared. Finally, we critically assess current challenges and future directions of the field. Manmade fibrillar hydrogels mimic the structure of filamentous extracellular matrices and can be used as biomaterials for 3D cell culture and tissue engineering.

bdb1e5d331394a8489880dbea685b5f9,Chemical evolution of atmospheric organic carbon over multiple generations of oxidation,"The evolution of atmospheric organic carbon as it undergoes oxidation has a controlling influence on concentrations of key atmospheric species, including particulate matter, ozone and oxidants. However, full characterization of organic carbon over hours to days of atmospheric processing has been stymied by its extreme chemical complexity. Here we study the multigenerational oxidation of pinene in the laboratory, characterizing products with several stateoftheart analytical techniques. Although quantification of some early generation products remains elusive, full carbon closure is achieved (within measurement uncertainty) by the end of the experiments. These results provide new insights into the effects of oxidation on organic carbon properties (volatility, oxidation state and reactivity) and the atmospheric lifecycle of organic carbon. Following an initial period characterized by functionalization reactions and particle growth, fragmentation reactions dominate, forming smaller species. After approximately one day of atmospheric aging, most carbon is sequestered in two longlived reservoirsvolatile oxidized gases and lowvolatility particulate matter. Nearly all organic carbon has now been quantified and characterized in a highly complex evolving atmospheric system, specifically, the multigenerational oxidation of pinene. It has been observed that initial addition of functional groups quickly gives way to fragmentation reactions, with organic carbon ultimately becoming sequestered in chemically resistant reservoirs: organic aerosols and longlived gasphase species.

Genomewide analyses have revealed abundant and evolutionarily conserved circular RNAs across species, which suggest specific physiological roles of these species. Using a microarray approach, we detected increased expression of a circular RNA circDnmt1 in eight breast cancer cell lines and in patients with breast carcinoma. Silencing circDnmt1 inhibited cell proliferation and survival. Ectopic circDnmt1 increased the proliferative and survival capacities of breast cancer cells by stimulating cellular autophagy. We found that circDnmt1mediated autophagy was essential in inhibiting cellular senescence and increasing tumor xenograft growth. We further found that ectopically expressed circDnmt1 could interact with both p53 and AUF1, promoting the nuclear translocation of both proteins. Nuclear translocation of p53 induced cellular autophagy while AUF1 nuclear translocation reduced Dnmt1 mRNA instability, resulting in increased Dnmt1 translation. From here, functional Dnmt1 could then translocate into the nucleus, inhibiting p53 transcription. Computational algorithms revealed that both p53 and AUF1 could bind to different regions of circDnmt1 RNA. Our results showed that the highly expressed circular RNA circDnmt1 could bind to and regulate oncogenic proteins in breast cancer cells. Thus circDnmt1 appears to be an oncogenic circular RNA with potential for further preclinical research.",William W.

The innate immune system is activated in a number of degenerative and inflammatory retinal disorders such as agerelated macular degeneration (AMD). Retinal microglia, choroidal macrophages, and recruited monocytes, collectively termed 'retinal mononuclear phagocytes', are critical determinants of ocular disease outcome. Many publications have described the presence of these cells in mouse models for retinal disease; however, only limited aspects of their behavior have been uncovered, and these have only been uncovered using a single detection method. The workflow presented here describes a comprehensive analysis strategy that allows characterization of retinal mononuclear phagocytes in vivo and in situ. We present standardized working steps for scanning laser ophthalmoscopy of microglia from MacGreen reporter mice (mice expressing the macrophage colonystimulating factor receptor GFP transgene throughout the mononuclear phagocyte system), quantitative analysis of Iba1stained retinal sections and flat mounts, CD11bbased retinal flow cytometry, and qRTPCR analysis of key microglia markers. The protocol can be completed within 3 d, and we present data from retinas treated with laserinduced choroidal neovascularization (CNV), bright whitelight exposure, and Fam161aassociated inherited retinal degeneration.

However, there is limited empirical evidence linking representational overlap in the hippocampus to memory interference. Likewise, it is not fully understood how learning influences overlap among hippocampal representations. Using patternbased fMRI analyses, we tested for a bidirectional relationship between memory overlap in the human hippocampus and learning. First, we show that learning drives hippocampal representations of similar events apart from one another. These changes are not explained by task demands to discriminate similar stimuli and are fully absent in visual cortical areas that feed into the hippocampus. Second, we show that lower representational overlap in the hippocampus benefits subsequent learning by preventing interference between similar memories. These findings reveal targeted experiencedependent changes in hippocampal representations of similar events and provide a critical link between memory overlap in the hippocampus and behavioural expressions of memory interference. There is limited evidence linking learning related changes in hippocampal representations and memory interference. Here Favila and colleagues demonstrate that learning reduces overlap in hippocampal activity patterns corresponding to similar events, which benefits subsequent learning by preventing interference.

Such quantumlimited heat conduction is now observed over macroscopic distances, extending to a metre, in superconducting transmission lines. The emerging quantum technological apparatuses1,2, such as the quantum computer3,4,5,6, call for extreme performance in thermal engineering7. Cold distant heat sinks are needed for the quantized electric degrees of freedom owing to the increasing packaging density and heat dissipation. Importantly, quantum mechanics sets a fundamental upper limit for the flow of information and heat, which is quantified by the quantum of thermal conductance8,9,10. However, the short distance between the heatexchanging bodies in the previous experiments11,12,13,14 hinders their applicability in quantum technology. Here, we present experimental observations of quantumlimited heat conduction over macroscopic distances extending to a metre. We achieved this improvement of four orders of magnitude in the distance by utilizing microwave photons travelling in superconducting transmission lines. Thus, it seems that quantumlimited heat conduction has no fundamental distance cutoff. This work establishes the integration of normalmetal components into the framework of circuit quantum electrodynamics15,16,17, which provides a basis for the superconducting quantum computer18,19,20,21.

The mammalian sensory cortex sends many projections to evolutionarily older subcortical areas, but the function of most of these projections has remained unknown. Massimo Scanziani and colleagues find that cortiofugal projections from mouse visual cortex to the accessory optic system in the brainstem promote the adaptive plasticity of the optokinetic reflex (an innate eye movement that stabilizes the image on the retina in a moving animal). This study shows that visual cortex, an area that has principally been explored for its sensory processing function, has a role in the adaptation of a relatively simple motor behaviour. The mammalian visual cortex massively innervates the brainstem, a phylogenetically older structure, via corticofugal axonal projections1. Many corticofugal projections target brainstem nuclei that mediate innate motor behaviours, but the function of these projections remains poorly understood1,2,3,4. A prime example of such behaviours is the optokinetic reflex (OKR), an innate eye movement mediated by the brainstem accessory optic system3,5,6, that stabilizes images on the retina as the animal moves through the environment and is thus crucial for vision5. The OKR is plastic, allowing the amplitude of this reflex to be adaptively adjusted relative to other oculomotor reflexes and thereby ensuring image stability throughout life7,8,9,10,11. Although the plasticity of the OKR is thought to involve subcortical structures such as the cerebellum and vestibular nuclei10,11,12,13, cortical lesions have suggested that the visual cortex might also be involved9,14,15. Here we show that projections from the mouse visual cortex to the accessory optic system promote the adaptive plasticity of the OKR. OKR potentiation, a compensatory plastic increase in the amplitude of the OKR in response to vestibular impairment11,16,17,18, is diminished by silencing visual cortex. Furthermore, targeted ablation of a sparse population of corticofugal neurons that specifically project to the accessory optic system severely impairs OKR potentiation. Finally, OKR potentiation results from an enhanced drive exerted by the visual cortex onto the accessory optic system. Thus, corticofugal projections to the brainstem enable the visual cortex, an area that has been principally studied for its sensory processing function19, to plastically adapt the execution of innate motor behaviours.",Baohua Liu; Andrew D.

This qualitative study explored communication between neonatologists and parents to discover qualities which may enhance or impede parentclinician partnership under such difficult circumstances. Guided by the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Patient Centered Communication framework, semistructured individual interviews were conducted and analyzed regarding neonatologist and parent perceptions of their communication. Subjects consisted of nine dyads of neonatologists and Englishspeaking parents whose infant had an uncertain prognosis. Parents were overall satisfied with neonatologists' communications concerning their infant's uncertain trajectory. Nonetheless, both experienced challenges and distress during communication, impeding collaboration and engagement.

To date, the specific role of white matter (WM) abnormalities in schizophrenia spectrum disorders (SSD) patients with catatonia is largely unknown. In this study, diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI) data were collected from 111 righthanded SSD patients and 28 healthy controls. Catatonic symptoms were examined on the Northoff Catatonia Rating Scale (NCRS). We used wholebrain tractbased spatial statistics (TBSS), tractometry (along tract statistics using TractSeg) and graph analytics (clustering coefficientCCO, local betweenness centralityBC) to provide a framework of specific WM microstructural abnormalities underlying catatonia in SSD. Following a categorical approach, post hoc analyses showed differences in fractional anisotrophy (FA) measured via tractometry in the corpus callosum, corticospinal tract and thalamopremotor tract as well as increased CCO as derived by graph analytics of the right superior parietal cortex (SPC) and left caudate nucleus in catatonic patients (NCRS total score  3; n  30) when compared to noncatatonic patients (NCRS total score  0; n  29). In catatonic patients according to DSMIVTR (n  43), catatonic symptoms were associated with FA variations (tractometry) of the left corticospinal tract and CCO of the left orbitofrontal cortex, primary motor cortex, supplementary motor area and putamen. This study supports the notion that structural reorganization of WM bundles connecting orbitofrontalparietal, thalamic and striatal regions contribute to catatonia in SSD patients.",Jakob Wasserthal; Klaus H.

However, the regulatory mechanisms have not yet been elucidated. In this study, we aimed to investigate how the posttranscriptional regulation mediated by cancer exosomederived miRNAs affected the JAKSTAT signaling pathway and the development of eMDSCs. Using miRNA microarray, we screened miR9 and miR181a which were exclusively upregulated in eMDSCs and inversely associated with SOCS3 expression. We found both miRNAs promoted the amplification of immature eMDSCs with the strong suppression on Tcell immunity in mice and humans. Furthermore, miR9 and miR181a promoted 4T1 tumor growth and immune escape via enhancing eMDSCs infiltration in situ. But miR9 and miR181a stimulated eMDSCs development by separately inhibiting SOCS3 and PIAS3, two crucial regulators in the negative feedback loop of the JAKSTAT signaling pathway. Elevated miR9 and miR181a in eMDSCs was derived from tumorderived exosomes, and blocking the exosome release could fully attenuate the miRNAmediated regulation on eMDSCs development. In summary, our findings indicated that tumor exosomederived miR9 and miR181a activated the JAKSTAT signaling pathway via targeting SOCS3 and PIAS3, respectively, and thus promoted the expansion of eMDSCs which might provide potential therapeutic target for IL6high breast cancer treatment.",Mengmeng Jiang; Wenwen Zhang; Rui Zhang; Pengpeng Liu; Yingnan Ye; Wenwen Yu; Xiaojing Guo; Jinpu Yu,Cancer microenvironment; Cytokines,"Cancer Molecular Diagnostics Core, Tianjin Medical University Cancer Institute and Hospital, National Clinical Research Center for Cancer, Tianjin's Clinical Research Center for Cancer, Key Laboratory of Cancer Prevention and Therapy, Tianjin, China; Department of Oncology, Tianjin Third Central Hospital, Tianjin, China; Cancer Molecular Diagnostics Core, Tianjin Medical University Cancer Institute and Hospital, National Clinical Research Center for Cancer, Tianjin's Clinical Research Center for Cancer, Key Laboratory of Cancer Prevention and Therapy, Tianjin, China; Department of Immunology, Tianjin Medical University Cancer Institute and Hospital, National Clinical Research Center for Cancer, Tianjin's Clinical Research Center for Cancer, Tianjin, China; Cancer Molecular Diagnostics Core, Tianjin Medical University Cancer Institute and Hospital, National Clinical Research Center for Cancer, Tianjin's Clinical Research Center for Cancer, Key Laboratory of Cancer Prevention and Therapy, Tianjin, China; Department of Immunology, Tianjin Medical University Cancer Institute and Hospital, National Clinical Research Center for Cancer, Tianjin's Clinical Research Center for Cancer, Tianjin, China; Cancer Molecular Diagnostics Core, Tianjin Medical University Cancer Institute and Hospital, National Clinical Research Center for Cancer, Tianjin's Clinical Research Center for Cancer, Key Laboratory of Cancer Prevention and Therapy, Tianjin, China; Department of Immunology, Tianjin Medical University Cancer Institute and Hospital, National Clinical Research Center for Cancer, Tianjin's Clinical Research Center for Cancer, Tianjin, China; Cancer Molecular Diagnostics Core, Tianjin Medical University Cancer Institute and Hospital, National Clinical Research Center for Cancer, Tianjin's Clinical Research Center for Cancer, Key Laboratory of Cancer Prevention and Therapy, Tianjin, China; Department of Immunology, Tianjin Medical University Cancer Institute and Hospital, National Clinical Research Center for Cancer, Tianjin's Clinical Research Center for Cancer, Tianjin, China; Department of Immunology, Tianjin Medical University Cancer Institute and Hospital, National Clinical Research Center for Cancer, Tianjin's Clinical Research Center for Cancer, Tianjin, China; Key Laboratory of Cancer Immunology and Biotherapy, Tianjin, China; Department of Breast Pathology and Lab, Key Laboratory of Breast Cancer of Breast Cancer Prevention and Therapy, National Clinical Research Center for Cancer, Tianjin Medical University Cancer Institute and Hospital, Tianjin, China; Cancer Molecular Diagnostics Core, Tianjin Medical University Cancer Institute and Hospital, National Clinical Research Center for Cancer, Tianjin's Clinical Research Center for Cancer, Key Laboratory of Cancer Prevention and Therapy, Tianjin, China; Department of Immunology, Tianjin Medical University Cancer Institute and Hospital, National Clinical Research Center for Cancer, Tianjin's Clinical Research Center for Cancer, Tianjin, China; Key Laboratory of Cancer Immunology and Biotherapy, Tianjin, China"
ec13c292b3134199ba4fa9c3d6609f64,DNA damage response signaling pathways and targets for radiotherapy sensitization in cancer,"Radiotherapy is one of the most common countermeasures for treating a wide range of tumors. However, the radioresistance of cancer cells is still a major limitation for radiotherapy applications. Efforts are continuously ongoing to explore sensitizing targets and develop radiosensitizers for improving the outcomes of radiotherapy. DNA doublestrand breaks are the most lethal lesions induced by ionizing radiation and can trigger a series of cellular DNA damage responses (DDRs), including those helping cells recover from radiation injuries, such as the activation of DNA damage sensing and early transduction pathways, cell cycle arrest, and DNA repair. Obviously, these protective DDRs confer tumor radioresistance. Targeting DDR signaling pathways has become an attractive strategy for overcoming tumor radioresistance, and some important advances and breakthroughs have already been achieved in recent years. On the basis of comprehensively reviewing the DDR signal pathways, we provide an update on the novel and promising druggable targets emerging from DDR pathways that can be exploited for radiosensitization. We further discuss recent advances identified from preclinical studies, current clinical trials, and clinical application of chemical inhibitors targeting key DDR proteins, including DNAPKcs (DNAdependent protein kinase, catalytic subunit), ATMATR (ataxiatelangiectasia mutated and Rad3related), the MRN (MRE11RAD50NBS1) complex, the PARP (polyADPribose] polymerase) family, MDC1, Wee1, LIG4 (ligase IV), CDK1, BRCA1 (BRCA1 C terminal), CHK1, and HIF1 (hypoxiainducible factor1).

He had comorbid heterotopic ossification (HO) of the left hip. Surprisingly, his autonomic symptoms resolved following resection of the HO. In hindsight, loss of motion through the hip caused by HO may have led to hinging through a previously asymptomatic lumbar Charcot joint, causing dysautonomia.

Regular practice activity has come to a virtual standstill and the dental industry has seen a very significant reduction in its provision of products and services. There are differing government financial mitigations in place across dental practices for NHS and, to an extent private, activity, as well as for the dental industry. Dentistry is generally classified in the very highrisk category of aerosol production through many aerosol generating procedures (AGPs). To facilitate any move towards the resumption of widespread dental treatment, possibly without mass vaccination or the widespread use of antibody testing, the aerosol issue will need to be addressed and solved. From a dental industry perspective, equipment and product manufacturers and suppliers are building upon, and further developing, the industry's extremely close relationship and partnership with the dental profession, in order to develop and implement new ways of thinking and new approaches, products and techniques to protect patients and clinicians, focusing on a return to the more widespread provision of dentistry.",Edmund Proffitt,Dentistry,"Chief Executive, British Dental Industry Association, Mineral Lane, Chesham, Buckinghamshire, HP5 1NL, UK"
8b76e5c86c574f35b25db4dc4fab80ed,Integrated singlecell and bulk gene expression and ATACseq reveals heterogeneity and early changes in pathways associated with resistance to cetuximab in HNSCCsensitive cell lines,"Identifying potential resistance mechanisms while tumour cells still respond to therapy is critical to delay acquired resistance. We generated the first comprehensive multiomics, bulk and singlecell data in sensitive head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) cells to identify immediate responses to cetuximab. Two pathways potentially associated with resistance were focus of the study: regulation of receptor tyrosine kinases by TFAP2A transcription factor, and epithelialtomesenchymal transition (EMT). Singlecell RNAseq demonstrates heterogeneity, with cellspecific TFAP2A and VIM expression profiles in response to treatment and also with global changes to various signalling pathways. RNAseq and ATACseq reveal global changes within 5 days of therapy, suggesting early onset of mechanisms of resistance; and corroborates cell line heterogeneity, with different TFAP2A targets or EMT markers affected by therapy. Lack of TFAP2A expression is associated with HNSCC decreased growth, with cetuximab and JQ1 increasing the inhibitory effect. Regarding the EMT process, shortterm cetuximab therapy has the strongest effect on inhibiting migration. TFAP2A silencing does not affect cell migration, supporting an independent role for both mechanisms in resistance. Overall, we show that immediate adaptive transcriptional and epigenetic changes induced by cetuximab are heterogeneous and cell type dependent; and independent mechanisms of resistance arise while tumour cells are still sensitive to therapy.",Luciane T.

Recently, we detected a 3OC12HSLinduced PTM in a cellfree system in which a crude extract from 3OC12HSLtreated HeLa cells was able to inactivate and ubiquitinate at position 144 a recombinant PON2. Here we show the occurrence of this and new PTMs on PON2 in HeLa cells. PTMs were found to gather nearby the two SNPs, A148G, and S311C, that are related to type2 diabetes and its complications. Furthermore, we detected a PTM nearby a 12 amino acids region that is deleted in PON2 Isoform 2. An in vitro mutation analysis showed that the SNPs and the deletion are involved in PON2 activity and suggested a role of PTMs on its modulation, while a SAXS analysis pointed to Isoform 2 as being largely unstructured, compared to the wild type. Besides, we discovered a control of PON2 expression via a putative mRNA operon involving the Wilms tumor 1 associated protein (WTAP) and the E3 ubiquitin ligase (E3UbL) baculoviral IAP repeatcontaining 3 (BIRC3).",Teresa Maria Carusone; Giovanna Cardiero; Mariangela Cerreta; Luigi Mandrich; Oscar Moran; Elena Porzio; Giuliana Catara; Giuseppina Lacerra; Giuseppe Manco,Hydrolases; SAXS; Ubiquitylation,"Institute of Biochemistry and Cell Biology (IBBC, CNR), National Research Council, Naples, Italy; Institute of Genetics and Biophysics ""Adriano Buzzati Traverso"", (IGBABT, CNR), National Research Council, Naples, Italy; Institute of Biochemistry and Cell Biology (IBBC, CNR), National Research Council, Naples, Italy; Institute of Biochemistry and Cell Biology (IBBC, CNR), National Research Council, Naples, Italy; Institute of Biophysics (IBF, CNR), National Research Council, Genoa, Italy; Institute of Biochemistry and Cell Biology (IBBC, CNR), National Research Council, Naples, Italy; Institute of Biochemistry and Cell Biology (IBBC, CNR), National Research Council, Naples, Italy; Institute of Genetics and Biophysics ""Adriano Buzzati Traverso"", (IGBABT, CNR), National Research Council, Naples, Italy; Institute of Biochemistry and Cell Biology (IBBC, CNR), National Research Council, Naples, Italy"

The processes underpinning cisplatininduced ototoxicity are not well understood. Gap junction channels composed of connexin (Cx) subunits allow for the passage of small molecules and ions between contacting neighboring cells. These specialized channels have been postulated to enhance cisplatininduced cell death by spreading ""death signals"" throughout the supporting cells of the organ of Corti. This study sought to investigate the role of Cx43 in cisplatininduced ototoxicity using organotypic cochlear cultures from control and two Cx43mutant mouse strains harboring either a moderate (Cx43I130T) or severe (Cx43G60S) reduction of Cx43 function. Cochlear cultures from Cx43mutant mice with a severe reduction in Cx43based gap junctional intercellular communication (GJIC) had an enhanced number of hair cells that were positive for cleaved caspase 3, a marker of active apoptosis, after cisplatin treatment. In cisplatintreated organotypic cochlear cultures, there was a decrease in the colocalization of Cx26 and Cx30 compared with untreated cultures, suggesting that cisplatin causes reorganization of connexin composition in supporting cells. Both Cx26 and Cx30 protein expression as well as GJIC were decreased in organotypic cochlear cultures treated with the gapjunction blocker carbenoxolone. When cisplatin and carbenoxolone were coadministered, there were no differences in hair cell loss compared with cisplatin treatment alone. Using cisplatintreated control and Cx43ablated organ of Corti derived HEIOC1 mouse cells, we found that greatly reducing GJIC led to preferential induction of an ER stress pathway. Taken together, this study strongly suggests that inhibition of GJIC in organ of Corti cells does not lead to differential susceptibility to cisplatininduced ototoxicity. Although cisplatin causes the same degree of cell death in gap junction competent and incompetent cochlear cells, the engagement of the mitochondrial dysregulation and ER stress differs.",Julia Abitbol; Rianne Beach; Kevin Barr; Jessica Esseltine; Brian Allman; Dale Laird,Cell biology; Mechanisms of disease,"Department of Anatomy and Cell Biology, Schulich School of Medicine and Dentistry, University of Western Ontario, London, Canada; Department of Anatomy and Cell Biology, Schulich School of Medicine and Dentistry, University of Western Ontario, London, Canada; Department of Anatomy and Cell Biology, Schulich School of Medicine and Dentistry, University of Western Ontario, London, Canada; Division of BioMedical Sciences, Faculty of Medicine, Memorial University of Newfoundland, St. John's, Canada; Department of Anatomy and Cell Biology, Schulich School of Medicine and Dentistry, University of Western Ontario, London, Canada; Department of Anatomy and Cell Biology, Schulich School of Medicine and Dentistry, University of Western Ontario, London, Canada"
91b0a3a0748c4442a4abed52a1be17dd,PCBP1 modulates the innate immune response by facilitating the binding of cGAS to DNA,"Cyclic GMPAMP synthase (cGAS) is a key sensor critical for the recognition of DNA in the cytosol and catalyzes the synthesis of the second messenger cyclic GMPAMP (cGAMP), which binds to the adapter protein MITA (also known as STING, MPYS, and ERIS) to initiate the innate immune response. How the binding of DNA to and the activation of cGAS are regulated remains poorly understood. Using a biochemical purification approach, we identified poly(rC)binding protein 1 (PCBP1) as a cGASassociated protein. PCBP1 was recruited to cGAS in a viral infectiondependent manner. PCBP1 directly bound to DNA and enhanced cGAS binding to its ligands, which was important for cGAS activation. Consistently, PCBP1 deficiency inhibited cytosolic DNA and DNA virustriggered transcription of downstream effector genes. These findings suggest that PCBP1 plays an important role in the cGASmediated innate immune response to DNA virus infection by promoting the binding of cGAS to viral DNA.",ChenYang Liao; CaoQi Lei; HongBing Shu,Cell signalling; Pattern recognition receptors,"Department of Infectious Diseases, Frontier Science Center for Immunology and Metabolism, Medical Research Institute, Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan University, Wuhan, China; Department of Infectious Diseases, Frontier Science Center for Immunology and Metabolism, Medical Research Institute, Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan University, Wuhan, China; Department of Infectious Diseases, Frontier Science Center for Immunology and Metabolism, Medical Research Institute, Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan University, Wuhan, China"

Even though this ordering has been studied extensively for more than a century, some fundamental mechanisms remain elusive. Here, we show the unexpected effects of two correlated phenomena on the ordering mechanism: anharmonicity and segregation. The local anharmonicity in the strain fields induced by interstitials substantially reduces the critical concentration for interstitial ordering, up to a factor of three. Further, the competition between interstitial ordering and segregation results in an effective decrease of interstitial segregation into extended defects for high interstitial concentrations. The mechanism and corresponding impact on interstitial ordering identified here enrich the theory of phase transitions in materials and constitute a crucial step in the design of ultrahighperformance alloys. The interstitial ordering in FeC alloys is shown to be stabilized by local anharmonicity in strain fields, which substantially reduces the critical C concentration for ordering.

Autophagosome biogenesis responds to a plethora of signals and involves unique and dynamic membrane processes. Autophagy is an important cellular mechanism allowing the cell to meet various demands, and its disruption compromises homeostasis and leads to various diseases, including metabolic disorders, neurodegeneration and cancer. Thus, not surprisingly, the elucidation of the molecular mechanisms governing autophagosome biogenesis has attracted considerable interest. Key molecules and organelles involved in autophagosome biogenesis, including autophagyrelated (ATG) proteins and the endoplasmic reticulum, have been discovered, and their roles and relationships have been investigated intensely. However, several fundamental questions, such as what supplies membraneslipids to build the autophagosome and how the membrane nucleates, expands, bends into a spherical shape and finally closes, have proven difficult to address. Nonetheless, owing to recent studies with new approaches and technologies, we have begun to unveil the mechanisms underlying these processes on a molecular level. We now know that autophagosome biogenesis is a highly complex process, in which multiple proteins and lipids from various membrane sources, supported by the formation of membrane contact sites, cooperate with biophysical phenomena, including membrane shaping and liquidliquid phase separation, to ensure seamless segregation of the autophagic cargo. Together, these studies pave the way to obtaining a holistic view of autophagosome biogenesis. Autophagy involves engulfment of cellular components into doublemembrane vesicles called autophagosomes. The biogenesis of autophagosomes requires the cooperation of multiple proteins and lipids from various membrane sources. Our understanding of the molecular mechanisms of the initiation, growth, bending and closure of autophagosomal membranes is expanding at a rapid pace.",Hitoshi Nakatogawa,Autophagosomes; Autophagy,"School of Life Science and Technology, Tokyo Institute of Technology, Yokohama, Japan"
4d26f752a15641e48ad12b9b31017b6b,A distal enhancer at risk locus 11q13.5 promotes suppression of colitis by T reg cells,"Genetic variations underlying susceptibility to complex autoimmune and allergic diseases are concentrated within noncoding regulatory elements termed enhancers1. The functions of a large majority of diseaseassociated enhancers are unknown, in part owing to their distance from the genes they regulate, a lack of understanding of the cell types in which they operate, and our inability to recapitulate the biology of immune diseases in vitro. Here, using shared synteny to guide lossoffunction analysis of homologues of human enhancers in mice, we show that the prominent autoimmune and allergic disease risk locus at chromosome 11q13.527 contains a distal enhancer that is functional in CD4 regulatory T (Treg) cells and required for Tregmediated suppression of colitis. The enhancer recruits the transcription factors STAT5 and NFB to mediate signaldriven expression of Lrrc32, which encodes the protein glycoprotein A repetitions predominant (GARP). Whereas disruption of the Lrrc32 gene results in early lethality, mice lacking the enhancer are viable but lack GARP expression in Foxp3 Treg cells, which are unable to control colitis in a celltransfer model of the disease. In human Treg cells, the enhancer forms conformational interactions with the promoter of LRRC32 and enhancer risk variants are associated with reduced histone acetylation and GARP expression. Finally, functional finemapping of 11q13.5 using CRISPRactivation (CRISPRa) identifies a CRISPRaresponsive element in the vicinity of risk variant rs11236797 capable of driving GARP expression. These findings provide a mechanistic basis for association of the 11q13.5 risk locus with immunemediated diseases and identify GARP as a potential target in their therapy. Shared synteny guides lossoffunction analysis of human enhancer homologues in mice, identifying a distal enhancer at the autoimmune and allergic disease risk locus at chromosome 11q13.5 whose function in regulatory T cells provides a mechanistic basis for its role in disease.",Rabab Nasrallah; Charlotte J.

Here, highresolution transmission electron microscopy revealed the different atomic structures in La0.6Sr0.4CoO3 thin films grown under tensile and compressive strain conditions. The atomic structure of the tensilestrained film indicated significant local concentration of the oxygen vacancies, with the average value of the oxygen nonstoichiometry being much larger than for the compressivestrained film. In addition to the vacancy concentration differences that are measured by isotope exchange depth profiling, significant vacancy ordering was found in tensilestrained films. This understanding might be useful for tuning the atomic structure of La0.6Sr0.4CoO3 thin films to optimize cathode performance. Strain engineering can enhance oxygen transport in cathodes in solid oxide fuel cells.

c0d7494caab24621ab50baeb55343849,Timed inhibition of CDC7 increases CRISPRCas9 mediated templated repair,"Repair of double strand DNA breaks (DSBs) can result in gene disruption or gene modification via homology directed repair (HDR) from donor DNA. Altering cellular responses to DSBs may rebalance editing outcomes towards HDR and away from other repair outcomes. Here, we utilize a pooled CRISPR screen to define host cell involvement in HDR between a Cas9 DSB and a plasmid double stranded donor DNA (dsDonor). We find that the Fanconi Anemia (FA) pathway is required for dsDonor HDR and that other genes act to repress HDR. Small molecule inhibition of one of these repressors, CDC7, by XL413 and other inhibitors increases the efficiency of HDR by up to 3.5 fold in many contexts, including primary T cells. XL413 stimulates HDR during a reversible slowing of Sphase that is unexplored for Cas9induced HDR. We anticipate that XL413 and other such rationally developed inhibitors will be useful tools for gene modification.

3697664279a541bbac6fa6a0b45c97d4,Diversity in medullary thymic epithelial cells controls the activity and availability of iNKT cells,"The thymus supports multiple  T cell lineages that are functionally distinct, but mechanisms that control this multifaceted development are poorly understood. Here we examine medullary thymic epithelial cell (mTEC) heterogeneity and its influence on CD1drestricted iNKT cells. We find three distinct mTEClow subsets distinguished by surface, intracellular and secreted molecules, and identify LTR as a cellautonomous controller of their development. Importantly, this mTEC heterogeneity enables the thymus to differentially control iNKT sublineages possessing distinct effector properties. mTEC expression of LTR is essential for the development thymic tuft cells which regulate NKT2 via IL25, while LTR controls CD104CCL21 mTEClow that are capable of IL15transpresentation for regulating NKT1 and NKT17. Finally, mTECs regulate both iNKTmediated activation of thymic dendritic cells, and iNKT availability in extrathymic sites. In conclusion, mTEC specialization controls intrathymic iNKT cell development and function, and determines iNKT pool size in peripheral tissues. Thymus is a unique environment hosting the development of many T cell subsets with distinct functions. Here the authors show that medullary thymic epithelial cells (mTEC) are functionally diverse, with LTR signaling serving differential regulation of mTEC for specific control of multiple lineages of invariant natural killer T cells.",Beth Lucas; Andrea J.

To address this unmet challenge, we engineer tunable active surface topographies with micronsized pillars that can beat at a programmable frequency and force level in an electromagnetic field. Compared to the flat and static controls, active topographies with the optimized design prevent biofilm formation and remove established biofilms of uropathogenic Escherichia coli (UPEC), Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Staphylococcus aureus, with up to 3.7 logs of biomass reduction. In addition, the detached biofilm cells are found sensitized to bactericidal antibiotics to the level comparable to exponentialphase planktonic cells. Based on these findings, a prototype catheter is engineered and found to remain clean for at least 30 days under the flow of artificial urine medium, while the control catheters are blocked by UPEC biofilms within 5 days.

However, polarized infrared imaging under scattering based on 2D materials has yet to be realized. Here we report the systematic investigation of polarized infrared imaging for a designed target obscured by scattering media using an anisotropic tellurium photodetector. Broadband sensitive photoresponse is realized at room temperature, with excellent stability without degradation under ambient atmospheric conditions. Significantly, a large anisotropic ratio of tellurium ensures polarized imaging in a scattering environment, with the degree of linear polarization over 0.8, opening up possibilities for developing nextgeneration polarized midinfrared imaging technology. Photodetectors operating within scattering environment can be realized with anisotropic materials.

86a92353a00c4b8cb65f98b97967b008,Targeting lysyl oxidase (LOX) overcomes chemotherapy resistance in triple negative breast cancer,"Chemoresistance is a major obstacle in triple negative breast cancer (TNBC), the most aggressive breast cancer subtype. Here we identify hypoxiainduced ECM remodeler, lysyl oxidase (LOX) as a key inducer of chemoresistance by developing chemoresistant TNBC tumors in vivo and characterizing their transcriptomes by RNAsequencing. Inhibiting LOX reduces collagen crosslinking and fibronectin assembly, increases drug penetration, and downregulates ITGA5FN1 expression, resulting in inhibition of FAKSrc signaling, induction of apoptosis and resensitization to chemotherapy. Similarly, inhibiting FAKSrc results in chemosensitization. These effects are observed in 3Dcultured cell lines, tumor organoids, chemoresistant xenografts, syngeneic tumors and PDX models. Reexpressing the hypoxiarepressed miR1423p, which targets HIF1A, LOX and ITGA5, causes further suppression of the HIF1LOXITGA5FN1 axis. Notably, higher LOX, ITGA5, or FN1, or lower miR1423p levels are associated with shorter survival in chemotherapytreated TNBC patients. These results provide strong preclinical rationale for developing and testing LOX inhibitors to overcome chemoresistance in TNBC patients. The development of chemoresistance is a major hurdle in triple negative breast cancer (TNBC). Here, the authors show that lysyl oxidase (LOX) is overexpressed in chemoresistant TNBCs, and when inhibited reduces collagen crosslinking, fibronectin fibril assembly, and downstream integrin signalling, overcoming resistance.",Ozge Saatci; Aysegul Kaymak; Umar Raza; Pelin G.

941e1e62027b433894332de051c4de51,"Resistance to targeted therapies as a multifactorial, gradual adaptation to inhibitor specific selective pressures","Despite high initial efficacy, targeted therapies eventually fail in advanced cancers, as tumors develop resistance and relapse. In contrast to the substantial body of research on the molecular mechanisms of resistance, understanding of how resistance evolves remains limited. Using an experimental model of ALK positive NSCLC, we explored the evolution of resistance to different clinical ALK inhibitors. We found that resistance can originate from heterogeneous, weakly resistant subpopulations with variable sensitivity to different ALK inhibitors. Instead of the commonly assumed stochastic single hit (epi) mutational transition, or druginduced reprogramming, we found evidence for a hybrid scenario involving the gradual, multifactorial adaptation to the inhibitors through acquisition of multiple cooperating genetic and epigenetic adaptive changes. Additionally, we found that during this adaptation tumor cells might present unique, temporally restricted collateral sensitivities, absent in therapy naive or fully resistant cells, suggesting the potential for new therapeutic interventions, directed against evolving resistance. Acquired resistance to cancer therapies reflects the ability of cancers to adapt to therapyimposed selective pressures. Here, the authors elucidate the dynamics of developing resistance to ALK inhibitors in an ALK lung cancer cell line showing that resistance originates from drugspecific tolerant cancer cells and it develops as a gradual adaptation.",Robert Vander Velde; Nara Yoon; Viktoriya Marusyk; Arda Durmaz; Andrew Dhawan; Daria Miroshnychenko; Diego LozanoPeral; Bina Desai; Olena Balynska; Jan Poleszhuk; Liu Kenian; Mingxiang Teng; Mohamed Abazeed; Omar Mian; Aik Choon Tan; Eric Haura; Jacob Scott; Andriy Marusyk,Experimental evolution; Nonsmallcell lung cancer,"Department of Cancer Physiology, H Lee Moffitt Cancer Centre and Research Institute, Tampa, USA; Department of Molecular Medicine, University of South Florida, Tampa, USA; Department of Translational Hematology and Oncology Research, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, USA; Department of Cancer Physiology, H Lee Moffitt Cancer Centre and Research Institute, Tampa, USA; Department of Translational Hematology and Oncology Research, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, USA; Systems Biology and Bioinformatics, Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine, Cleveland, USA; Department of Translational Hematology and Oncology Research, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, USA; Department of Cancer Physiology, H Lee Moffitt Cancer Centre and Research Institute, Tampa, USA; Department of Cancer Physiology, H Lee Moffitt Cancer Centre and Research Institute, Tampa, USA; Supercomputer and Bioinnovation Center, University of Malaga, Malaga, Spain; Department of Cancer Physiology, H Lee Moffitt Cancer Centre and Research Institute, Tampa, USA; University of South Florida Cancer Biology PhD Program, Tampa, USA; Department of Cancer Physiology, H Lee Moffitt Cancer Centre and Research Institute, Tampa, USA; Nalecz Institute of Biocybernetics and Biomedical Engineering, Polish Academy of Sciences, Warsaw, Poland; Department of Pathology, H Lee Moffitt Cancer Centre and Research Institute, Tampa, USA; Department of Biostatistic and Bioinformatics, H Lee Moffitt Cancer Centre and Research Institute, Tampa, USA; Department of Translational Hematology and Oncology Research, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, USA; Department of Translational Hematology and Oncology Research, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, USA; Department of Biostatistic and Bioinformatics, H Lee Moffitt Cancer Centre and Research Institute, Tampa, USA; Department of Thoracic Oncology, H Lee Moffitt Cancer Centre and Research Institute, Tampa, USA; Department of Translational Hematology and Oncology Research, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, USA; Systems Biology and Bioinformatics, Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine, Cleveland, USA; Department of Cancer Physiology, H Lee Moffitt Cancer Centre and Research Institute, Tampa, USA; Department of Molecular Medicine, University of South Florida, Tampa, USA"

One group of similarlyoriented trackways was attributed to 14 adult females who walked together at the same pace, with only two adult males and one juvenile accompanying them.

The neutrophiltolymphocyte ratio (NLR) is a desirable measure of systemic inflammation because it is easily calculated from a routine complete blood cell count with differentials. We sought to determine if an elevation in the NLR associates with greater weight loss, cachexia, and lower serum 25hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) concentrations in patients with advanced cancer. Advanced colon, lung, and prostate cancer patients (stages IIIIV; n  50) were retrospectively studied and separated into one of two groups: 1) Above (n  25) or 2) Below (n  25) the median NLR of 3.15 determined at diagnosis. Around the time of diagnosis, serum 25(OH)D and body weight were assessed, while body weight was assessed again at a later date. Weight loss and cachexia were significantly (both p  0.05) greater and there was a trend (p  0.10) for lower serum 25(OH)D concentrations in the Above group.

af00d59b19d545e0a2efb77c9ce1c249,Experimental investigation on rockburst behavior of the rockcoalbolt specimen under different stress conditions,"Coal and rock burst are one of the main dynamic disasters that affect coal mine production. In this paper, the burst structural model of the rockcoalbolt (RCB) system and the burst tendency criterion are established on the background of deep thin coal seam mining. Uniaxial and triaxial mechanical tests under different stress states are carried out on RCB specimens with different angles. Combined with thermal imaging, the mechanical behavior of the inclined RCB specimen under uniaxial loading is discussed. The results show that the burst tendency of the RCB specimen increases with the angle. The stressstrain curves of some uniaxial and triaxial test specimens show two or more peaks, and the thermal imaging evolutionary process shows that the cracks of the coal and rock develop from shear to tension shear cracks. There is a further development of fracture and energy accumulation between the first and second peaks in the stressstrain curve of the specimen. Therefore, the failure degree of the second peak of the specimen may be stronger than that of the first peak. Additionally, the established stiffness coefficient and burst energy index can better describe the burst tendency of the RCB specimen under different stress states. The results show that the burst tendency of the RCB specimen under the triaxial test is much higher than that of the uniaxial test. In other words, it also explains that the essence of the burst failure of the surrounding rock in the roadway is the initial instability induced by the inside surrounding rock in the roadway. Moreover, the burst tendency is the largest when the rock and coal combination angle is 15, and the burst damage range may also be increased by the failure of internal coal and rock mass.",Genshui Wu; Weijian Yu; Jianping Zuo; Chunyuan Li; Jiehua Li; Shaohua Du,Civil engineering; Coal; Natural hazards; Petrology,"School of Mechanics and Civil Engineering, China University of Mining and Technology, Beijing, China; State Key Laboratory of Coal Resources and Safe Mining, China University of Mining and Technology, Beijing, China; School of Resource  Environment and Safety Engineering, Hunan University of Science and Technology, Xiangtan, China; School of Mechanics and Civil Engineering, China University of Mining and Technology, Beijing, China; State Key Laboratory of Coal Resources and Safe Mining, China University of Mining and Technology, Beijing, China; School of Mechanics and Civil Engineering, China University of Mining and Technology, Beijing, China; School of Mechanics and Civil Engineering, China University of Mining and Technology, Beijing, China; Department of Civil Engineering, Monash University, Clayton, Australia"

Catechol is one of the natural compounds present in fruits and vegetables and has various pharmacological and physiological activities including anticarcinogenic effects. However, the effects of catechol on EMT has not been reported. Epidermal growth factor (EGF) is one of the growth factors and is known to play a role in inducing EMT. The present study showed that catechol suppressed not only the morphological changes to the mesenchymal phenotype of epithelial HCC cells, but also the reduction of Ecadherin and the increment of Vimentin, which are typical hallmark of EMT. In addition, catechol suppressed EMTrelated steps such as migration, invasion, anoikis resistance acquisition, and stem celllike characterization through the EGFRAKTERK signaling pathway during liver cancer metastasis. Therefore, these results suggest that catechol may be able to regulate the early metastasis of liver cancer in vitro.",WonChul Lim; Hyunhee Kim; YoungJoo Kim; BuNam Jeon; HeeBum Kang; Hyeonseok Ko,Biochemistry; Cancer; Cell biology,"Korea Food Research Institute, Wanjugun, Republic of Korea; Department of Biomedical Sciences, Asan Medical Center, AMIST, University of Ulsan College of Medicine, Seoul, Republic of Korea; Natural Products Research Center, Korea Institute of Science and Technology, Gangneung, Republic of Korea; Genome and Company, Pangyoro 253, Bundanggu, Seongnamsi, Republic of Korea; Voronoi Research Institute, S 12th F, Songdogwahakro 32 (IT center), Incheon, Republic of Korea; HLB Life Science, Seoul, Republic of Korea"

In this context, the work here presented reports on the development of a symmetrical wirebased supercapacitor able to use the wearer's sweat as the electrolyte. The inner and outer electrodes consists of a carbonbased thread functionalized with a conductive polymer (polypyrrole) which improves the electrochemical performances of the supercapacitor. The inner electrode is coated with electrospun cellulose acetate fibres, as the separator, and the outer electrode is twisted around it. The electrochemical performances of carbonbased supercapacitors were analyzed using a simulated sweat solution and displayed a specific capacitance of 2.3 F.g1, an energy of 386.5 mWh.kg1 and a power density of 46.4 kW.kg1. Moreover, cycle stability and bendability studies were performed. Such energy conversion device has exhibited a stable electrochemical performance under mechanical deformation, over than 1000 cycles, which make it attractive for wearable electronics.

The molecular and neural bases of the speciesspecific social behaviors of Apidae workers have not been analyzed. Here, we focused on two immediate early genes, hormone receptor 38 (HR38) and early growth response gene1 (Egr1), and lateupregulated ecdysone receptor (EcR), all of which are upregulated by foraging flight and expressed preferentially in the smalltype Kenyon cells of the mushroom bodies (MBs) in the honey bee brain. Gene expression analyses in Bombus ignitus revealed that HR38 and Egr1, but not EcR, exhibited an immediate early response during awakening from CO2 anesthesia. Both premature mRNA for HR38 and mature mRNA for Egr1 were induced during foraging flight, and mRNAs for HR38 and Egr1 were sparsely detected inside the whole MB calyces. In contrast, EcR expression was higher in forager brains than in nurse bees and was expressed preferentially in the smalltype Kenyon cells inside the MBs. Our findings suggest that Kenyon cells are active during foraging flight and that the function of lateupregulated EcR in the brain is conserved among these Apidae species.",Shiori Iino; Yurika Shiota; Masakazu Nishimura; Shinichi Asada; Masato Ono; Takeo Kubo,Animal behaviour; Molecular neuroscience,"Department of Biological Sciences, Graduate School of Science, The University of Tokyo, BunkyoKu, Tokyo, Japan; Department of Biological Sciences, Graduate School of Science, The University of Tokyo, BunkyoKu, Tokyo, Japan; Laboratory of Entomology, Graduate School of Agriculture, Tamagawa University, MachidaShi, Tokyo, Japan; Bioresource Sciences Major, Graduate School of Agriculture, Tamagawa University, MachidaShi, Tokyo, Japan; Laboratory of Entomology, Graduate School of Agriculture, Tamagawa University, MachidaShi, Tokyo, Japan; Department of Biological Sciences, Graduate School of Science, The University of Tokyo, BunkyoKu, Tokyo, Japan"

The present study applies 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing to investigate the development of the hostassociated microbiota during ontogeny. The potential for microbiota transfer between developmental stages, and the metabolic potential of these microbiota were evaluated. Representatives of Firmicutes were observed as early colonisers during the larval stages, followed by colonisation by organisms affiliating with Proteobacteria and Bacteroidetes as the flies matured into adults. Microbiota observed across all the developmental stages included Lactococcus, Lactobacillus and Enterococcus, while Weissella and Chishuiella were associated with newly hatched larvae and adults, respectively. Predictive metabolic profiling of the identified microorganisms further suggested that the microbiota and their functional profile mature alongside their host and putative hostmicrobe relationships are established at different stages of development.

Its substrate, creatine, is generated by Larginine:glycine amidinotransferase (AGAT) and guanidinoacetate Nmethyltransferase (GAMT). Creatine deficiency has more severe consequences for AGAT than GAMT KO mice. In the present study, to characterize their muscle phenotype further, we recorded the weight of tibialis anterior (TA), extensor digitorum longus (EDL), gastrocnemius (GAS), plantaris (PLA) and soleus (SOL) from creatinedeficient AGAT and GAMT, KO and WT mice. In GAS, PLA and SOL representing glycolytic, intermediate and oxidative muscle, respectively, we recorded the activities of pyruvate kinase (PK), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), citrate synthase (CS) and cytochrome oxidase (CO). In AGAT KO compared to WT mice, muscle atrophy and differences in marker enzyme activities were more pronounced in glycolytic than oxidative muscle. In GAMT KO compared to WT, the atrophy was modest, differences in PK and LDH activities were minor, and CS and CO activities were slightly higher in all muscles. SOL from males had higher CS and CO activities compared to females.

Despite its broad range of potential applications, commercialization and widespread adaption of AT has long been impeded by the cost and size of infrared (IR) cameras. In this paper, we demonstrate that this cost and size limitation can be overcome using cellphone attachment IR cameras. A software development kit (SDK) is developed that controls camera attributes through a simple USB interface and acquires camera frames at a constant frame rate up to 33 fps. To demonstrate the performance of our lowcost AT system, we report and discuss our experimental results on two high impact potential applications. The first set of experiments is conducted on a dental sample to investigate the clinical potential of the developed lowcost technology for detecting early dental caries, while the second set of experiments is conducted on the oralfluid based lateral flow immunoassay to determine the viability of our technology for detecting and quantifying cannabis consumption at the pointofcare.

Catering to the dynamic nature of visual world, we explored how the temporally dynamic visual input was stored in VWM. In the current study, the memory arrays were presented sequentially, and the contralateral delay activity (CDA), an electrophysiological measure, was used to identify whether the memory representations were transferred into the passive state. Participants were instructed to encode two sequential arrays and retrieve them respectively, with two conditions of interval across the two arrays: 400 ms and 800 ms. These results provided strong evidence for the stateseparated storage of two sequential arrays in different neural states if the interval between them was long enough, and the concurrent storage of them in the active state if the interval was relatively short.

940d62a61cdc4f4d80f007c55d0ecf8d,Development of Small Molecule MEIS Inhibitors that modulate HSC activity,"Meis1, which belongs to TALEtype class of homeobox gene family, appeared as one of the key regulators of hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) selfrenewal and a potential therapeutical target. However, small molecule inhibitors of MEIS1 remained unknown. This led us to develop inhibitors of MEIS1 that could modulate HSC activity. To this end, we have established a library of relevant homeobox family inhibitors and developed a highthroughput in silico screening strategy against homeodomain of MEIS proteins using the AutoDock Vina and PaDELADV platform. We have screened over a million druggable small molecules in silico and selected putative MEIS inhibitors (MEISi) with no predicted cytotoxicity or cardiotoxicity. This was followed by in vitro validation of putative MEIS inhibitors using MEIS dependent luciferase reporter assays and analysis in the ex vivo HSC assays. We have shown that small molecules named MEISi1 and MEISi2 significantly inhibit MEISluciferase reporters in vitro and induce murine (LSKCD34lw cells) and human (CD34, CD133, and ALDHhi cells) HSC selfrenewal ex vivo. In addition, inhibition of MEIS proteins results in downregulation of Meis1 and MEIS1 target gene expression including Hif1, Hif2 and HSC quiescence modulators. MEIS inhibitors are effective in vivo as evident by induced HSC content in the murine bone marrow and downregulation of expression of MEIS target genes.

Currently, AIEC is identified phenotypically, since no molecular marker specific for AIEC exists. An algorithm based on single nucleotide polymorphisms was previously presented as a potential molecular tool to classify AIECnonAIEC, with 84% accuracy on a collection of 50 strains isolated in Girona (Spain). Herein, our aim was to determine the accuracy of the tool using AIECnonAIEC isolates from different geographical origins and extraintestinal pathogenic E. coli (ExPEC) strains. The accuracy of the tool was significantly reduced (61%) when external AIECnonAIEC strains from France, Chile, Mallorca (Spain) and Australia (82 AIEC, 57 nonAIEC and 45 ExPEC strains in total) were included. However, the inclusion of only the ExPEC strains showed that the tool was fairly accurate at differentiating these two close pathotypes (84.6% sensitivity; 79% accuracy). Moreover, the accuracy was still high (81%) for those AIECnonAIEC strains isolated from Girona and Mallorca (N  63); two collections obtained from independent studies but geographically close.

Synthesis of NTs with Magneli phases have posed a challenge due to the degradation and loss of morphology in NTs upon hightemperature treatments (600 C) in a reducing environment. This study reports on the synthesis of anodically formed NTs containing Magneli phases through a double annealing route: oxygen (O2) annealing followed by annealing in 2% hydrogen with a nitrogen balance (2%H2N2). The nucleation, growth, and transformation of anodized amorphous NTs into crystalline phases was investigated. The NTs obtained through this route were highly ordered and composed of mixed phases of anatase, rutile, and the Magneli phase (Ti4O7). Experimental results from scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Xray diffraction (XRD), scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM), and Raman spectroscopy were combined with first principle calculations to develop an understanding of the sequential phase transformations during annealing. A predictive model was developed using density functional theory (DFT) to potentially predict the titanium oxides formed and their stability with reference to the mole fraction of oxygen. The change in the density of states (DOS), band structure, optical properties, and stability of phases are also discussed using DFT simulations. The combination of experimental characterization and modelling helped to understand the nucleation of anatase and rutile and the reorganization of these phases to form Magneli phases on the anodized amorphous NTs through annealing treatment.",Hammad Malik; Sayan Sarkar; Swomitra Mohanty; Krista Carlson,Materials for devices; Materials for energy and catalysis; Nanoscale materials; Techniques and instrumentation; Theory and computation,"Department of Materials Science and Engineering, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, USA; Department of Materials Science and Engineering, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, USA; Department of Materials Science and Engineering, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, USA; Department of Chemical Engineering, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, USA; Department of Materials Science and Engineering, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, USA"

The root architecture of 22yearold olive trees was determined nondestructively with a Root Detector device (Fakopp Enterprise Bt) using sonic speed and directly by a 3D digitizer (Fastrak, Polhemus) after soil removal. The radial and vertical distributions of the coarse root biomass and diameter in the soil as determined by the 3D digitizer were correlated with the root map detected by sonic speed. A highly significant correlation was observed between the coarse root biomass distribution and the sonic speed within 30 cm of soil depth, but this correlation decreased with increasing distance from the trunk, up to 120 cm. No correlations were observed between sonic speed and root diameter. The Root Detector was able to map the coarse roots of the olive tree in the soil environment, but only under certain conditions. First, root detection was more efficient within 30 cm of soil depth, provided that more than 35% of the total biomass of lateral roots occurs within this depth range. Second, the distance of 120 cm from the trunk, scaled as 6fold the DBH, may be considered the threshold over which the sonic speed and the detection of roots markedly decreased.

To identify the nucleotide variant causative of this disease, we reanalyzed the linkage of the original Japanese pedigree including seven newly ascertained subjects with updated information. We assigned the locus of the disease to 1p13.3q23 (maximum logarithmofodds score  2.71). Exome sequencing for five patients and one healthy relative from the pedigree revealed 2526 patientspecific singlenucleotide variants (SNVs). By rigorous filtering processes using public databases, our linkage results, and functional prediction, followed by Sanger sequencing of the pedigree and 520 healthy Japanese individuals, we identified an intronic SNV in IQGAP3, a gene known to be associated with neurite outgrowth. Upon pathological examination of the sural nerve, moderate, chronic, mainly axonal neuropathy was observed. By histochemical analyses, we observed a patientspecific increase of IQGAP3 expression in the sural nerve. We concluded that the variant of IQGAP3 is associated with the disease in our pedigree.",Shiroh Miura; Kengo Kosaka; Tomofumi Shimojo; Eiji Matsuura; Kazuhito Noda; Ryuta Fujioka; ShinIchiro Mori; Fujio Umehara; Toru Iwaki; Ken Yamamoto; Hirotomo Saitsu; Hiroki Shibata,Genetic linkage study; Genetics research,"Department of Neurology and Geriatric Medicine, Ehime University Graduate School of Medicine, Toon, Japan; Division of Genomics, Medical Institute of Bioregulation, Kyushu University, Fukuoka, Japan; Division of Respirology, Neurology and Rheumatology, Department of Medicine, Kurume University School of Medicine, Kurume, Japan; Division of Genomics, Medical Institute of Bioregulation, Kyushu University, Fukuoka, Japan; Division of Genomics, Medical Institute of Bioregulation, Kyushu University, Fukuoka, Japan; Department of Neurology and Geriatrics, Kagoshima University Graduate School of Medical and Dental Sciences, Kagoshima, Japan; Nodakousei Clinic, Ogi, Japan; Department of Food and Nutrition, Beppu University Junior College, Beppu, Japan; Division of Respirology, Neurology and Rheumatology, Department of Medicine, Kurume University School of Medicine, Kurume, Japan; Department of Neuropathology, Neurological Institute, Graduate School of Medical Sciences, Kyushu University, Fukuoka, Japan; Department of Neurology, Nanpuh Hospital, Kagoshima, Japan; Department of Neuropathology, Neurological Institute, Graduate School of Medical Sciences, Kyushu University, Fukuoka, Japan; Department of Medical Chemistry, Kurume University School of Medicine, Kurume, Japan; Department of Biochemistry, Hamamatsu University School of Medicine, Hamamatsu, Japan; Division of Genomics, Medical Institute of Bioregulation, Kyushu University, Fukuoka, Japan"

This immunodeficiency syndrome is generally characterized by severe recurrent infections, Bombay blood group, reduced growth and intellectual disability (ID). Features are all caused by an inability to generate key fucosylated molecules due to a defective transport of GDPfucose into the Golgi. Here we report the use of exome sequencing to identify biallelic variants in SLC35C1 (c.501_503delCTT, p.(Phe168del) and c.891T  G, p.(Asn297Lys)) in an individual with short stature and ID. Retrospective clinical examination based on the genetic findings revealed increased otitis media as the only immunological feature present in this child. Biochemical analysis of patient serum identified a clear but mild decrease in protein fucosylation. Modelling all described missense mutations on a SLC35C1 protein model showed pathogenic substitutions localise to close to the dimer interface, providing insight into the possible pathophysiology of nonsynonymous causative variants identified in patients. Our evidence confirms this is the second family presenting with only a subset of features and broadens the clinical presentation of this syndrome. Of note, both families segregated a common allele (p.Phe168del), suggesting there could be an associated genotypephenotype relationship for specific variants. Based on two out of 14 reported families not presenting with the characteristic features of SLC35C1CDG, we suggest there is clinical utility in considering this gene in patients with short stature and ID.",Karen M.

aed9a93079f9494ebbf4bf9d509beba9,Performing optical logic operations by a diffractive neural network,"Optical logic operations lie at the heart of optical computing, and they enable many applications such as ultrahighspeed information processing. However, the reported optical logic gates rely heavily on the precise control of input light signals, including their phase difference, polarization, and intensity and the size of the incident beams. Due to the complexity and difficulty in these precise controls, the two output optical logic states may suffer from an inherent instability and a low contrast ratio of intensity. Moreover, the miniaturization of optical logic gates becomes difficult if the extra bulky apparatus for these controls is considered. As such, it is desirable to get rid of these complicated controls and to achieve full logic functionality in a compact photonic system. Such a goal remains challenging. Here, we introduce a simple yet universal design strategy, capable of using plane waves as the incident signal, to perform optical logic operations via a diffractive neural network. Physically, the incident plane wave is first spatially encoded by a specific logic operation at the input layer and further decoded through the hidden layers, namely, a compound Huygens' metasurface. That is, the judiciously designed metasurface scatters the encoded light into one of two small designated areas at the output layer, which provides the information of output logic states. Importantly, after training of the diffractive neural network, all seven basic types of optical logic operations can be realized by the same metasurface. As a conceptual illustration, three logic operations (NOT, OR, and AND) are experimentally demonstrated at microwave frequencies. Carefullydesigned diffractive metasurfaces enable accurate logical operations for optical computing. Using photons instead of electrons to convey information could reduce energy consumption and increase computing speed. However, the light properties must be controlled with very high precision in order to clearly distinguish between '0' and '1' logical states, and this is difficult to do without adding extra bulky components. Now, Hongsheng Chen at Zhejiang University in China and coworkers have used diffractive metasurfaces  carefully structured optical components designed from the atomic scale upwards  to realize all seven of the basic logic operations used in computation. Their components, which can be shrunk to the chip scale, clearly direct light into one of two designated areas indicating '0' or '1', even when the properties of the input light have not been optimally controlled.",Chao Qian; Xiao Lin; Xiaobin Lin; Jian Xu; Yang Sun; Erping Li; Baile Zhang; Hongsheng Chen,"Electronics, photonics and device physics; Metamaterials","Interdisciplinary Center for Quantum Information, State Key Laboratory of Modern Optical Instrumentation, College of Information Science and Electronic Engineering, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China; ZJUHangzhou Global Science and Technology Innovation Center, Key Lab. of Advanced MicroNano Electronic Devices  Smart Systems of Zhejiang, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China; Department of Electrical Engineering, California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, USA; ZJUUIUC Institute, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China; Interdisciplinary Center for Quantum Information, State Key Laboratory of Modern Optical Instrumentation, College of Information Science and Electronic Engineering, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China; Division of Physics and Applied Physics, School of Physical and Mathematical Sciences, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore, Singapore; Interdisciplinary Center for Quantum Information, State Key Laboratory of Modern Optical Instrumentation, College of Information Science and Electronic Engineering, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China; Department of Electrical Engineering, California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, USA; Interdisciplinary Center for Quantum Information, State Key Laboratory of Modern Optical Instrumentation, College of Information Science and Electronic Engineering, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China; ZJUHangzhou Global Science and Technology Innovation Center, Key Lab. of Advanced MicroNano Electronic Devices  Smart Systems of Zhejiang, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China; Interdisciplinary Center for Quantum Information, State Key Laboratory of Modern Optical Instrumentation, College of Information Science and Electronic Engineering, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China; ZJUUIUC Institute, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China; Division of Physics and Applied Physics, School of Physical and Mathematical Sciences, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore, Singapore; Interdisciplinary Center for Quantum Information, State Key Laboratory of Modern Optical Instrumentation, College of Information Science and Electronic Engineering, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China; ZJUHangzhou Global Science and Technology Innovation Center, Key Lab. of Advanced MicroNano Electronic Devices  Smart Systems of Zhejiang, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China; ZJUUIUC Institute, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China"

Disruptions in network connectivity through impaired neuronal structure have been implicated in both rodents and humans. However, the neurobiological mechanisms leading to directpathway neuron disconnectivity in stereotypy remain poorly understood. We have a mouse line with Tropomyosin receptor kinase B (TrkB) receptor deletion from D1expressing cells (D1CreflTrkB) in which a subset of animals shows repetitive rotations and head tics with juvenile onset. Here we demonstrate these behaviors may be associated with abnormal directpathway activity by reducing rotations using chemogenetic inhibition of dorsal striatum D1medium spiny neurons (D1MSNs) in both juvenile and youngadult mice. Taking advantage of phenotypical differences in animals with similar genotypes, we then interrogated the D1MSN specific translatome associated with repetitive behavior by using RNA sequencing of ribosomeassociated mRNA. Detailed translatome analysis followed by multiplexed gene expression assessment revealed profound alterations in neuronal projection and synaptic structure related genes in stereotypy mice. Examination of neuronal morphology demonstrated dendritic atrophy and dendritic spine loss in dorsal striatum D1MSNs from mice with repetitive behavior. Together, our results uncover phenotypespecific molecular alterations in D1MSNs that relate to morphological adaptations in mice displaying stereotypy behavior.",Michel Engeln; Yang Song; Ramesh Chandra; Ashley La; Megan E.

However, the regulatory mechanism of TNFAIP1 degradation remains largely elusive. In the present study, with a labelfree quantitative proteomic approach, TNFAIP1 was identified as a novel ubiquitin target of the CullinRING E3 ubiquitin ligase (CRL) complex. More importantly, Cul3ROC1 (CRL3), a subfamily of CRLs, was identified to specifically interact with TNFAIP1 and promote its polyubiquitination and degradation. Mechanistically, BTBD9, a specific adaptor component of CRL3 complex, was further defined to bind and promote the ubiquitination and degradation of TNFAIP1 in cells. As such, downregulation of BTBD9 promoted lung cancer cell migration by upregulating the expression of TNFAIP1, whereas TNFAIP1 deletion abrogated this effect. Finally, bioinformatics and clinical sample analyses revealed that BTBD9 was downregulated while TNFAIP1 was overexpressed in human lung cancer, which was associated with poor overall survival of patients. Taken together, these findings reveal a previously unrecognized mechanism by which the CRL3BTBD9 ubiquitin ligase controls TNFAIP1 degradation to regulate cancer cell migration.",Lihui Li; Wenjuan Zhang; Yue Liu; Xiaojun Liu; Lili Cai; Jihui Kang; Yunjing Zhang; Wenlian Chen; Changsheng Dong; Yanmei Zhang; Mingsong Wang; Wenyi Wei; Lijun Jia,Lung cancer; Oncogenes,"Cancer Institute, Longhua Hospital, Shanghai University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Shanghai, China; Cancer Institute, Longhua Hospital, Shanghai University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Shanghai, China; Cancer Institute, Fudan University Shanghai Cancer Center, Fudan University, Shanghai, China; Department of Laboratory Medicine, Huadong Hospital, Affiliated to Fudan University, Shanghai, China; Cancer Institute, Fudan University Shanghai Cancer Center, Fudan University, Shanghai, China; Cancer Institute, Longhua Hospital, Shanghai University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Shanghai, China; Cancer Institute, Longhua Hospital, Shanghai University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Shanghai, China; Cancer Institute, Longhua Hospital, Shanghai University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Shanghai, China; Cancer Institute, Longhua Hospital, Shanghai University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Shanghai, China; Cancer Institute, Longhua Hospital, Shanghai University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Shanghai, China; Department of Laboratory Medicine, Huadong Hospital, Affiliated to Fudan University, Shanghai, China; Xinhua Hospital, Shanghai Jiaotong University, Shanghai, China; Department of Pathology, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Harvard Medical School, Boston, USA; Cancer Institute, Longhua Hospital, Shanghai University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Shanghai, China"

2760bce16d8049d6ae801d082b795a77,The deubiquitylase USP2 maintains ErbB2 abundance via counteracting endocytic degradation and represents a therapeutic target in ErbB2positive breast cancer,"ErbB2 overexpression identifies a subclass of breast cancer as ErbB2positive that is frequently associated with poor prognosis. Current ErbB2targeted therapies have profoundly improved patient outcomes, but mutations occurring in ErbB2 have been shown to confer drug resistance. Induction of ErbB2 degradation was proposed as an intriguing strategy to battle with ErbB2positive breast cancer and reduced mutationincurred drug resistance. Although multiple HSP90 inhibitors have been demonstrated to effectively trigger ErbB2 degradation, none succeeded in the clinical evaluations. To develop novel ErbB2targeting strategies, we investigated the endocytic degradation and reversible ubiquitylation of ErbB2 in breast cancer. In this study, we reveal that HSP90 inhibition leads to efficient ubiquitylation and endocytic degradation of ErbB2 through the canonical endolysosomal route. USP2 associates with internalized ErbB2 and prevents its lysosomal sorting and degradation via exerting deubiquitylase activity. Accordingly, the USP2 inhibitor ML364 is capable of inducing ErbB2 ubiquitylation and accelerating its turnover. ML364 potentiates the prodegradation effects of HSP90 inhibitors on ErbB2 and hence sensitizes ErbB2positive breast cancer cells to HSP90 inhibition. The combination of USP2 and HSP90 inhibitors effectively restrains ErbB2positive breast cancer xenograft growth in vivo. Based on these observations, we conclude that USP2 safeguards ErbB2 surface levels by antagonizing its ubiquitylationmediated endocytic degradation, which can be exploited to design novel therapeutic strategies against ErbB2driven malignancies as combinatorial treatment with HSP90 inhibitors.",Jinrui Zhang; Shuyan Liu; Qiong Li; Yulin Shi; Yueguang Wu; Fang Liu; Shanshan Wang; Mohamed Y.

However, whether VEGFR12 and NRP1 are regulated by the same upstream mechanism is unclear, especially in gastric cancer. We used prediction tools to detect miRNAs that may simultaneously regulate VEGFR12 and NRP1, and we finally determined that miR590 can simultaneously regulate VEGFR12 and NRP1 in gastric cancer. We discovered that miR590 was downregulated in gastric cancer tissues and cell lines, and this was related to the dysregulation of the transcription factor SNAIL. In addition, the overexpression of miR590 inhibits the migration, invasion, proliferation and DMVA levels of gastric cancer cells in vivo and in vitro by targeting VEGFR12 and NRP1. We also demonstrated that miR590 may be a useful marker for the prognosis of gastric cancer with KaplanMeier survival analysis. Since the epithelialtomesenchymal transition (EMT) is an important mechanism of tumour invasion and metastasis and VEGFR12 and NRP1 can promote the occurrence of EMT, we speculated that miR590 can regulate the occurrence of EMT. Immunoblot and immunofluorescence analyses confirmed that the overexpression of miR590 can inhibit the EMT in gastric cancer cells. Since SNAIL is also a mesenchymal marker, our results revealed a new, positive feedback loop. As a transcription factor, SNAIL inhibits the expression of miR590, thereby upregulating the expression levels of NRP1 and VEGFR12; this leads to the development of EMT in gastric cancer and the upregulation of SNAIL.",Bin Mei; Jiajie Chen; Ni Yang; Yang Peng,Cancer; Noncoding RNAs,"Hepatic Surgery Centre, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China; Department of Geriatrics, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China; Department of Geriatrics, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China; Department of Geriatrics, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"

However, the role of sepiapterin reductase in hepatocellular carcinoma remains largely unknown. Here, we found that sepiapterin reductase was frequently highly expressed in human hepatocellular carcinoma, which was significantly associated with higher T stage, higher tumor node metastasis stage, and even shorter survival of hepatocellular carcinoma patients. Furthermore, cell and animal experiments showed that sepiapterin reductase depletion inhibited cancer cell proliferation and promoted cancer cell apoptosis. Importantly, the results suggested that sepiapterin reductase enzymatic activity was not necessary for the progression of hepatocellular carcinoma, based on the comparison between SMMC7721 and SMMC7721 containing sepiapterin reductase mutant. Moreover, we showed that sepiapterin reductase regulated the development of hepatocellular carcinoma via the FoxO3aBimsignaling pathway.

3f864c3db34c4c6a9091fd4bb1d90f75,Premature failure of an additively manufactured material,"Additively manufactured metallic materials exhibit excellent mechanical strength. However, they often fail prematurely owing to external defects (pores and unmelted particles) that act as sites for crack initiation. Cracks then propagate through grain boundaries andor cellular boundaries that contain continuous brittle second phases. In this work, the premature failure mechanisms in selective laser melted (SLM) materials were studied. A submicron structure was introduced in a SLM AgCuGe alloy that showed semicoherent precipitates distributed in a discontinuous but periodic fashion along the cellular boundaries. This structure led to a remarkable strength of 410  3 MPa with 16  0.5% uniform elongation, well surpassing the strengthductility combination of their cast and annealed counterparts. The hierarchical SLM microstructure with a periodic arrangement of precipitates and a high density of internal defects led to a high strain hardening rate and strong strengthening, as evidenced by the fact that the precipitates were twinned and encircled by a high density of internal defects, such as dislocations, stacking faults and twins. However, the samples fractured before necking owing to the crack acceleration along the external defects. This work provides an approach for additively manufacturing materials with an ultrahigh strength combined with a high ductility provided that premature failure is alleviated. An analysis of metallic alloys fabricated through layerbylayer deposition processes has revealed critical factors in preventing these materials from unexpectedly breaking. In selective laser melting (SLM) technology, thin layers of metal powders are assembled into threedimensional objects using rapid heating and cooling steps. Zhi Wang from the South China University of Technology in Guangzhou and colleagues now show that the microstructure of a silvercoppergermanium alloy formed through SLM can affect the material's strength. Using optical and Xray microscopy, the team found that regularly spaced precipitates formed inside the 3Dprinted alloy prevented abrupt atomic sliding movements, giving the material a higher natural strength and good ductility. Fractures that occurred at lower than expected stress levels were identified as arising from errors in the printing process, such as pores and unmelted powder particles. A submicron structure strategy was introduced in a selective laser melted (SLM) AgCuGe alloy, showing semicoherent precipitates distributed in a discontinuous but periodic fashion along the cellular boundaries. It leads to a remarkable strength of ~410 MPa with ~16% ductility, well surpassing the strengthductility combination of their cast counterparts. The hierarchal SLM microstructure and high density of internal defects leading to a high strain hardening rate and strong strengthening.

To understand the consequence of serine catabolism, we screened natural products to identify a fungal metabolite chaetoglobosin D (ChD) as a specific inhibitor of fission yeast cell growth when cultivated with serine as a sole nitrogen source. ChD targets actin, and actin mutant cells showed severe growth defect on serine medium. ROS accumulated in cells when cultivated in serine medium, while actin mutant cells showed increased sensitivity to oxidative stress. ROS production is a new aspect of serine metabolism, which might be involved in disease progression, and actin could be the drug target for curing serinedependent symptoms.",Akihiko Kanou; Shinichi Nishimura; Toshitsugu Tabuchi; Akihisa Matsuyama; Minoru Yoshida; Taira Kato; Hideaki Kakeya,Cell growth; Chemical genetics,"Department of System Chemotherapy and Molecular Sciences, Division of Bioinformatics and Chemical Genomics, Graduate School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan; Department of System Chemotherapy and Molecular Sciences, Division of Bioinformatics and Chemical Genomics, Graduate School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan; Department of Biotechnology, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan; Collaborative Research Institute for Innovative Microbiology, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan; Chemical Genomics Research Group, RIKEN Center for Sustainable Resource Science, Saitama, Japan; Department of Biotechnology, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan; Department of Biotechnology, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan; Chemical Genomics Research Group, RIKEN Center for Sustainable Resource Science, Saitama, Japan; Department of Biotechnology, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan; Collaborative Research Institute for Innovative Microbiology, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan; Chemical Genomics Research Group, RIKEN Center for Sustainable Resource Science, Saitama, Japan; Research  Development Division, MicroBiopharm Japan Co., Ltd., Kiyosushi, Japan; Department of System Chemotherapy and Molecular Sciences, Division of Bioinformatics and Chemical Genomics, Graduate School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan"

This is a crosssectional study with a representative sample of 378 89yearold children from all urban schools in the city of Vicosa, MG, Brazil. Sociodemographic data and information on lifestyle, and food consumption were collected. Biochemical evaluation included glucose, triglycerides, leptin, calcidiol 25(OH)D], and parathormone. Body composition was assessed by dual energy Xray absorptiometry. Cardiometabolic risk was considered when nontraditional risk markers were detected, including triglyceride  glycemia index (TyG index), hyperleptinemia, and hypertriglyceridemic waist phenotype (HWP). The receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) was used to define the cutoff point for serum 25(OH)D to predict cardiometabolic risk. 25(OH)D showed better predictive capacity for grouping of cardiometabolic risk markers than for either single or paired markers. The area under the curve for grouping of risk markers was 0.636 (95% CI: 0.585, 0.685, P  0.001). The cutoff point to predict cardiometabolic risk was defined as 32.0 ngmL. 25(OH)D presented good predictive capacity for cardiometabolic risk and 25(OH)D concentration higher than 32 ngmL was associated with a 49% reduction of cardiometabolic risk prevalence in prepubertal Brazilian children.",Luana Cupertino Milagres; Mariana De Santis Filgueiras; Naruna Pereira Rocha; Lara Gomes Suhett; Fernanda Martins de Albuquerque; Leidjaira Lopes Juvanhol; Sylvia do Carmo Castro Franceschini; Juliana Farias de Novaes,Disease prevention; Public health; Risk factors,"Department of Nutrition and Health, Biological Sciences Center, Federal University of Vicosa, Vicosa, Brazil; Department of Nutrition and Health, Biological Sciences Center, Federal University of Vicosa, Vicosa, Brazil; Department of Nutrition and Health, Biological Sciences Center, Federal University of Vicosa, Vicosa, Brazil; Department of Nutrition and Health, Biological Sciences Center, Federal University of Vicosa, Vicosa, Brazil; Department of Nutrition and Health, Biological Sciences Center, Federal University of Vicosa, Vicosa, Brazil; Department of Nutrition and Health, Biological Sciences Center, Federal University of Vicosa, Vicosa, Brazil; Department of Nutrition and Health, Biological Sciences Center, Federal University of Vicosa, Vicosa, Brazil; Department of Nutrition and Health, Biological Sciences Center, Federal University of Vicosa, Vicosa, Brazil"

A retrospective observational audit was conducted of data from 62,067 people who were due for annual diabetes eye screening in the North East London Diabetes Eye Screening Programme between January 2010 and January 2017, and who had missed at least one screening appointment within that time. Missing 5 consecutive screening appointments increased the incidence of referable retinopathy from a programme average of 4% up to 15%. The incidence of referable retinopathy in people missing 10 or more consecutive appointments was ~20%. There was an association between younger age, male gender, type I disease, and being of African ethnicity with increasing number of missed appointments. There was a strong association between the number of missed appointments and the proportion of patients showing referable retinopathy at the next visit. Approaches to reduce the number of missed appointments may help to reduce the incidence of referable retinopathy.

Data on the ambulatory blood pressure (BP) profile and BP variability (BPV) in peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients are absent. This study examined the BP profile and BPV of patients undergoing PD in comparison with hemodialysis (HD) and predialysis chronic kidney disease CKD patients. Thirtyeight PD patients were matched for age, sex, and dialysis vintage with 76 HD patients and for age and sex with 38 patients with CKD stage 24. Patients under PD or HD underwent 48h and CKD patients 24h ambulatory BP monitoring. BP levels and BPV indices were compared for the 48h, first and second 24 h, daytime and nighttime periods. Twoway mixed ANOVA for repeated measurements was used to evaluate the effects of dialysis modality and time on ambulatory BP in PD and HD. During all periods studied, SBP and DBP were numerically higher but not significantly different in PD than in HD patients. Systolic BP was significantly higher in PD or HD than in predialysis CKD (PD: 138.38  20.97 mmHg; HD: 133.75  15.5 mmHg; CKD: 125.52  13.4 mmHg, p  0.003), a difference evident also during daytime and nighttime periods. Repeatedmeasurements ANOVA showed no effect of dialysis modality on ambulatory BP during any period studied. All BPV indices studied were similar between PD and HD patients, in whom they were higher than in CKD individuals (first 24h systolicARV: PD: 11.86  3.19 mmHg; HD: 11.23  3.45 mmHg; CKD: 9.81  2.49 mmHg, p  0.016). Average BP levels and BPV indices are similar between PD and HD patients, in whom they are higher than in their CKD counterparts. The dialysis modality has no effect on the ambulatory BP profile.

8bf250d4c52e499dada81b2e9250d793,Rice pollen aperture formation is regulated by the interplay between OsINP1 and OsDAF1,"The aperture on the pollen surface provides an exit for the emerging pollen tube. Apertures exhibit huge morphological variation across plant speciesgrasses, including rice, possess a complex aperture consisting of an annulus and an operculumbut little is known about how this speciesspecific cellsurface pattern forms. Here, we report a lectin receptorlike kinase in Oryza sativa, OsDAF1, which is essential for annulus formation and thus for fertility. OsDAF1 is evenly distributed in early microsporocytes but localizes to the distal preaperture site at the tetrad stage. We further reveal that the rice orthologue of a key aperture factor in Arabidopsis, OsINP1, has conserved and diversified roles in rice aperture formation. Disruption of OsINP1 prevents formation of the aperture, precluding pollentube germination. Furthermore, our results demonstrate that OsINP1 is required for polarization of OsDAF1 via direct protein interaction, suggesting that OsINP1 has an additional role in the formation of annulus that is absent in Arabidopsis. Our study reveals the importance of the aperture for rice grain yield and reveals mechanisms controlling pollen aperture development in cereal species. Apertures are thin areas on the wall of pollen grains where pollen tubes can penetrate. The number and configuration of pollen apertures vary drastically in different plant species. Here, Xu Zhang and colleagues identify a novel aperture factor that is essential for the formation of pollen aperture and for reproduction in rice.",Xu Zhang; Guochao Zhao; Qian Tan; Hui Yuan; Natalie Betts; Lu Zhu; Dabing Zhang; Wanqi Liang,Cell biology; Plant sciences,"Joint International Research Laboratory of Metabolic  Developmental Sciences, State Key Laboratory of Hybrid Rice, School of Life Sciences and Biotechnology, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China; Joint International Research Laboratory of Metabolic  Developmental Sciences, State Key Laboratory of Hybrid Rice, School of Life Sciences and Biotechnology, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China; Development Center of Plant Germplasm Resources, College of Life Sciences, Shanghai Normal University, Shanghai, China; Joint International Research Laboratory of Metabolic  Developmental Sciences, State Key Laboratory of Hybrid Rice, School of Life Sciences and Biotechnology, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China; Joint International Research Laboratory of Metabolic  Developmental Sciences, State Key Laboratory of Hybrid Rice, School of Life Sciences and Biotechnology, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China; Development Center of Plant Germplasm Resources, College of Life Sciences, Shanghai Normal University, Shanghai, China; School of Agriculture, Food and Wine, University of Adelaide, Waite Campus, Glen Osmond, Australia; Joint International Research Laboratory of Metabolic  Developmental Sciences, State Key Laboratory of Hybrid Rice, School of Life Sciences and Biotechnology, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China; Joint International Research Laboratory of Metabolic  Developmental Sciences, State Key Laboratory of Hybrid Rice, School of Life Sciences and Biotechnology, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China; School of Agriculture, Food and Wine, University of Adelaide, Waite Campus, Glen Osmond, Australia; Joint International Research Laboratory of Metabolic  Developmental Sciences, State Key Laboratory of Hybrid Rice, School of Life Sciences and Biotechnology, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China"
b0ec61816f864357b9d0457dab646e73,LSM28 and XRN2 contribute to the silencing of H3K27me3marked genes through targeted RNA decay,"In fission yeast and plants, RNA processing and degradation contribute to heterochromatin silencing, alongside conserved pathways of transcriptional repression. It has not been known whether similar pathways exist in metazoans. Here, we describe a pathway of silencing in Caenorhabditis elegans somatic cells, in which the highly conserved RNAbinding complex LSM28 contributes selectively to the repression of heterochromatic reporters and endogenous genes bearing the Polycomb mark, histone H3K27me3. This acts by degrading selected transcripts through the XRN2 exoribonuclease. Disruption of the LSM28 pathway leads to mRNA stabilization. Unlike previously described pathways of heterochromatic RNA degradation, LSM28mediated RNA degradation does not target nor require H3K9 methylation. Intriguingly, loss of this pathway coincides with a localized reduction in H3K27me3 at lsm8sensitive loci. We have thus uncovered a mechanism of RNA degradation that selectively contributes to the silencing of a subset of H3K27me3marked genes, revealing a previously unrecognized layer of posttranscriptional control in metazoan heterochromatin. Mattout et al. show that the nuclear LSM28 complex acts with the exonuclease XRN2 to degrade transcripts of H3K27me3marked genes, thus facilitating gene silencing.",Anna Mattout; Dimos Gaidatzis; Jan Padeken; Christoph D.

However, despite intensive research efforts, controversy remains about the form of the basic interactions governing the physics of this material. Even the sign of the Kitaev interaction (the bonddependent anisotropic interaction responsible for Kitaev physics) is still under debate, with conflicting results from theoretical and experimental studies5,6,915. The significance of the symmetric offdiagonal exchange interaction (referred to as the  term) is another contentious question1618. Here, we present resonant elastic Xray scattering data that provide unambiguous experimental constraints to the two leading terms in the magnetic interaction Hamiltonian. We show that the Kitaev interaction (K) is ferromagnetic, and that the  term is antiferromagnetic and comparable in size to the Kitaev interaction. Our findings also provide a natural explanation for the large anisotropy of the magnetic susceptibility in RuCl3 as arising from the large  term. We therefore provide a crucial foundation for understanding the interactions underpinning the exotic magnetic behaviours observed in RuCl3. RuCl3 is a promising candidate for realizing the Kitaev quantum spin liquid, but the physics governing its magnetic behaviour remain elusive.

Early models simply damaged the rodent brain through toxins or lesions. Later, the spread of genetic engineering technology enabled investigators to develop models of familial AD by overexpressing human genes such as those encoding amyloid precursor protein (APP) or presenilins (PSEN1 or PSEN2) carrying mutations linked to earlyonset AD. Recently, more complex models have sought to explore the impact of multiple genetic risk factors in the context of different biological challenges. Although none of these models has proven to be a fully faithful reproduction of the human disease, models remain essential as tools to improve our understanding of AD biology, conduct thorough pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic analyses, discover translatable biomarkers and evaluate specific therapeutic approaches. To realize the full potential of animal models as new technologies and knowledge become available, it is critical to define an optimal strategy for their use. Here, we review progress and challenges in the use of AD mouse models, highlight emerging scientific innovations in model development, and introduce a conceptual framework for use of preclinical models for therapeutic development. This Review highlights the challenges of using mouse models to advance drug discovery in Alzheimer disease, discussing the emerging opportunities to optimize disease modelling and alternative preclinical research systems to test therapeutic approaches in this highly prevalent disease.",Kimberly ScearceLevie; Pascal E.

Historical proposals that some groups, such as sauropods and hadrosaurs, lived in aquatic environments2,3 were abandoned decades ago46. It has recently been argued that at least some of the spinosauridsan unusual group of largebodied theropods of the Cretaceous erawere semiaquatic7,8, but this idea has been challenged on anatomical, biomechanical and taphonomic grounds, and remains controversial911. Here we present unambiguous evidence for an aquatic propulsive structure in a dinosaur, the giant theropod Spinosaurus aegyptiacus7,12. This dinosaur has a tail with an unexpected and unique shape that consists of extremely tall neural spines and elongate chevrons, which forms a large, flexible finlike organ capable of extensive lateral excursion. Using a robotic flapping apparatus to measure undulatory forces in physical models of different tail shapes, we show that the tail shape of Spinosaurus produces greater thrust and efficiency in water than the tail shapes of terrestrial dinosaurs and that these measures of performance are more comparable to those of extant aquatic vertebrates that use vertically expanded tails to generate forward propulsion while swimming. These results are consistent with the suite of adaptations for an aquatic lifestyle and piscivorous diet that have previously been documented for Spinosaurus7,13,14. Although developed to a lesser degree, aquatic adaptations are also found in other members of the spinosaurid clade15,16, which had a nearglobal distribution and a stratigraphic range of more than 50 million years14, pointing to a substantial invasion of aquatic environments by dinosaurs. Discovery that the giant theropod dinosaur Spinosaurus has a large flexible tail indicates that it was primarily aquatic and swam in a similar manner to extant tailpropelled aquatic vertebrates.",Nizar Ibrahim; Simone Maganuco; Cristiano Dal Sasso; Matteo Fabbri; Marco Auditore; Gabriele Bindellini; David M.

7db091de4d1d4e749c4a1e70d10c5a89,Ionic solids from common colloids,"From rock salt to nanoparticle superlattices, complex structure can emerge from simple building blocks that attract each other through Coulombic forces14. On the micrometre scale, however, colloids in water defy the intuitively simple idea of forming crystals from oppositely charged partners, instead forming nonequilibrium structures such as clusters and gels57. Although various systems have been engineered to grow binary crystals811, native surface charge in aqueous conditions has not been used to assemble crystalline materials. Here we form ionic colloidal crystals in water through an approach that we refer to as polymerattenuated Coulombic selfassembly. The key to crystallization is the use of a neutral polymer to keep particles separated by well defined distances, allowing us to tune the attractive overlap of electrical double layers, directing particles to disperse, crystallize or become permanently fixed on demand. The nucleation and growth of macroscopic single crystals is demonstrated by using the Debye screening length to finetune assembly. Using a variety of colloidal particles and commercial polymers, ionic colloidal crystals isostructural to caesium chloride, sodium chloride, aluminium diboride and K4C60 are selected according to particle size ratios. Once fixed by simply diluting out solution salts, crystals are pulled out of the water for further manipulation, demonstrating an accurate translation from solutionphase assembly to dried solid structures. In contrast to other assembly approaches, in which particles must be carefully engineered to encode binding information1218, polymerattenuated Coulombic selfassembly enables conventional colloids to be used as model colloidal ions, primed for crystallization. Oppositely charged colloidal particles are assembled in water through an approach that allows electrostatic interactions to be precisely tuned to generate macroscopic single crystals.",Theodore Hueckel; Glen M.

Past molecular studies of MDD employed bulk homogenates of postmortem brain tissue, which obscures gene expression changes within individual cell types. Here we used singlenucleus transcriptomics to examine ~80,000 nuclei from the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex of male individuals with MDD (n  17) and of healthy controls (n  17). We identified 26 cellular clusters, and over 60% of these showed differential gene expression between groups. We found that the greatest dysregulation occurred in deep layer excitatory neurons and immature oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs), and these contributed almost half (47%) of all changes in gene expression. These results highlight the importance of dissecting celltypespecific contributions to the disease and offer opportunities to identify new avenues of research and novel targets for treatment. Singlenucleus transcriptomics reveal brain alterations associated with major depression. Deep layer excitatory cells and immature oligodendrocytes showed most changes, involving synaptic plasticity, immune function and steroid hormones.",Corina Nagy; Malosree Maitra; Arnaud Tanti; Matthew Suderman; JeanFrancois Theroux; Maria Antonietta Davoli; Kelly Perlman; Volodymyr Yerko; Yu Chang Wang; Shreejoy J.

However, current BET inhibitors are limited by their potency or oral bioavailability. Here we report the discovery and characterization of NHWD870, a BET inhibitor that is more potent than three major clinical stage BET inhibitors BMS986158, OTX015, and GSK525762. NHWD870 causes tumor shrinkage or significantly suppresses tumor growth in nine xenograft or syngeneic models. In addition to its ability to downregulate cMYC and directly inhibit tumor cell proliferation, NHWD870 blocks the proliferation of tumor associated macrophages (TAMs) through multiple mechanisms, partly by reducing the expression and secretion of macrophage colonystimulating factor CSF1 by tumor cells. NHWD870 inhibits CSF1 expression through suppressing BRD4 and its target HIF1. Taken together, these results reveal a mechanism by which BRD4 inhibition suppresses tumor growth, and support further development of NHWD870 to treat solid tumors. Inhibitors of the BET family proteins are limited by their potency and oral bioavailability. Here, the authors report a new BET inhibitor, NHWD870, with improved potency compared to previous BET inhibitors, and show that it suppresses BRD4 and targets tumour associated macrophages.",Mingzhu Yin; Ying Guo; Rui Hu; Wesley L.

However, the anatomical basis of such specific signaling remains unclear, owing to difficulties in resolving the spongiform domain of astrocytes where most tripartite synapses are located. Using 3DSTED microscopy in living organotypic brain slices, we imaged the spongiform domain of astrocytes and observed a reticular meshwork of nodes and shafts that often formed looplike structures. These anatomical features were also observed in acute hippocampal slices and in barrel cortex in vivo. The majority of dendritic spines were contacted by nodes and their sizes were correlated. FRAP experiments and Ca2 imaging showed that nodes were biochemical compartments and Ca2 microdomains. Mapping astrocytic Ca2 signals onto STED images of nodes and dendritic spines showed they were associated with individual synapses. Here, we report on the nanoscale organization of astrocytes, identifying nodes as a functional astrocytic component of tripartite synapses that may enable synapsespecific communication between neurons and astrocytes.

8adce713c9804bc7a07ebbedc64b407c,Fire decline in dry tropical ecosystems enhances decadal land carbon sink,"The terrestrial carbon sink has significantly increased in the past decades, but the underlying mechanisms are still unclear. The current synthesis of processbased estimates of land and ocean sinks requires an additional sink of 0.6 PgC yr1 in the last decade to explain the observed airborne fraction. A concurrent global fire decline was observed in association with tropical agriculture expansion and landscape fragmentation. Here we show that a decline of 0.2  0.1 PgC yr1 in fire emissions during 20082014 relative to 20012007 also induced an additional carbon sink enhancement of 0.4  0.2 PgC yr1 attributable to carbon cycle feedbacks, amounting to a combined sink increase comparable to the 0.6 PgC yr1 budget imbalance. Our results suggest that the indirect effects of fire, in addition to the direct emissions, is an overlooked mechanism for explaining decadalscale changes in the land carbon sink and highlight the importance of fire management in climate mitigation. In recent history the amount of carbon captured by terrestrial systems has increased, but the processes driving this process has remained poorly constrained. Here the authors use a global carbon model to show that a decrease in wildfires has caused the land carbon sink to increase in the past few decades.",Yi Yin; A.

Recently, cytosine base editors with rAPOBEC1 were reported to induce unguided cytosine deamination in genomic DNA and cellular RNA. Here we report eight nextgeneration CBEs (BE4 with either RrA3F wt, F130L], AmAPOBEC1, SsAPOBEC3B wt, R54Q], or PpAPOBEC1 wt, H122A, R33A]) that display comparable DNA ontarget editing frequencies, whilst eliciting a 12 to 69fold reduction in CtoU edits in the transcriptome, and up to a 45fold overall reduction in unguided offtarget DNA deamination relative to BE4 containing rAPOBEC1. Further, no enrichment of genomewide CG to TA edits are observed in mammalian cells following transfection of mRNA encoding five of these nextgeneration editors. Taken together, these nextgeneration CBEs represent a collection of base editing tools for applications in which minimized offtarget and high ontarget activity are required.

54207424106847d1a3f8058163efc19a,Viscosity of hcp iron at Earth's inner core conditions from density functional theory,"The inner core, extending to 1,221 km above the Earth's center at pressures between 329 and 364 GPa, is primarily composed of solid iron. Its rheological properties influence both the Earth's rotation and deformation of the inner core which is a potential source of the observed seismic anisotropy. However, the rheology of the inner core is poorly understood. We propose a mineral physics approach based on the density functional theory to infer the viscosity of hexagonal close packed (hcp) iron at the inner core pressure (P) and temperature (T). As plastic deformation is ratelimited by atomic diffusion under the extreme conditions of the Earth's center, we quantify selfdiffusion in iron nonempirically. The results are applied to model steadystate creep of hcp iron. Here, we show that dislocation creep is a key mechanism driving deformation of hcp iron at inner core conditions. The associated viscosity agrees well with the estimates from geophysical observations supporting that the inner core is significantly less viscous than the Earth's mantle. Such low viscosity rules out inner core translation, with melting on one side and solidification on the opposite, but allows for the occurrence of the seismically observed fluctuations in inner core differential rotation.",Sebastian Ritterbex; Taku Tsuchiya,Planetary science; Solid Earth sciences,"Geodynamics Research Center, Ehime University, 25 Bunkyocho, Matsuyama, Japan; Geodynamics Research Center, Ehime University, 25 Bunkyocho, Matsuyama, Japan"
422ff03d2e2e4d85b02998492c0ab24a,Arctic avian predators synchronise their spring migration with the northern progression of snowmelt,"Migratory species display a range of migration patterns between irruptive (facultative) to regular (obligate), as a response to different predictability of resources. In the Arctic, snow directly influences resource availability. The causes and consequences of different migration patterns of migratory species as a response to the snow conditions remains however unexplored. Birds migrating to the Arctic are expected to follow the spring snowmelt to optimise their arrival time and select for snowfree areas to maximise prey encounter enroute. Based on largescale movement data, we compared the migration patterns of three top predator species of the tundra in relation to the spatiotemporal dynamics of snow cover. The snowy owl, an irruptive migrant, the roughlegged buzzard, with an intermediary migration pattern, and the peregrine falcon as a regular migrant, all followed, as expected, the spring snowmelt during their migrations. However, the owl stayed ahead, the buzzard stayed on, and the falcon stayed behind the spatiotemporal peak in snowmelt. Although none of the species avoided snowcovered areas, they presumably used snow presence as a cue to time their arrival at their breeding grounds. We show the importance of environmental cues for species with different migration patterns.",Teja Curk; Ivan Pokrovsky; Nicolas Lecomte; Tomas Aarvak; Kurt Burnham; Andreas Dietz; Alastair Franke; Gilles Gauthier; KarlOtto Jacobsen; Jeff Kidd; Stephen B.

We report on the enhanced thermoelectric properties of ntype Bi2(SexTe1x)3 nanoplates using solvothermal synthesis by tuning the composition of selenium (Se). Variation of the Se composition within nanoplates is demonstrated using Xray diffraction and electron probe microanalysis. The calculated lattice parameters closely followed Vegard's law. However, when the Se composition was extremely high, an impurity phase was observed. At a reduced Se composition, regularhexagonalshaped nanoplates with a size of approximately 500 nm were produced. When the Se composition was increased, the shape distribution became random with sizes more than 5 m. To measure the thermoelectric properties, nanoplate thin films (NPTs) were formed on a flexible substrate using dropcasting, followed by thermal annealing. The resulting NPTs sufficiently adhered to the substrate during the bending condition. The electrical conductivity of the NPTs increased with an increase in the Se composition, but it rapidly decreased at an extremely high Se composition because of the presence of the impurity phase. As a result, the Bi2(SexTe1x)3 NPTs exhibited the highest power factor of 4.1 W(cmK2) at a Se composition of x  0.75. Therefore, it was demonstrated that the thermoelectric performance of Bi2(SexTe1x)3 nanoplates can be improved by tuning the Se composition.",Yuki Kimura; Ryotaro Mori; Susumu Yonezawa; Hayato Yabuki; Hiromasa Namiki; Yuichi Ota; Masayuki Takashiri,Materials science; Nanoparticles; Nanoscale materials,"Department of Materials Science, Tokai University, 411 Kitakaname, Hiratsuka, Japan; Department of Materials Science, Tokai University, 411 Kitakaname, Hiratsuka, Japan; Department of Materials Science, Tokai University, 411 Kitakaname, Hiratsuka, Japan; Department of Materials Science, Tokai University, 411 Kitakaname, Hiratsuka, Japan; Tokyo Metropolitan Industrial Technology Research Institute, 2410, Aomi, Kotoku, Tokyo, Japan; Tokyo Metropolitan Industrial Technology Research Institute, 2410, Aomi, Kotoku, Tokyo, Japan; Department of Materials Science, Tokai University, 411 Kitakaname, Hiratsuka, Japan"

We have developed a fluorescent anisotropy (FA) assay using a unique and versatile probe (fluorescent lipid II) and monitored direct binding between lipid II and interacting proteins (PBP1b, FtsW and MurJ), as well as between lipid II and interacting antibiotics (vancomycin, nisin, ramoplanin and a small molecule). Competition experiments performed using unlabelled lipid II, four lipid IIbinding antibiotics and moenomycin demonstrate that the assay can detect compounds interacting with lipid II or the proteins. These results provide a proofofconcept for the use of this assay in a highthroughput screening of compounds against all these targets. In addition, the assay constitutes a powerful tool in the study of the mode of action of compounds that interfere with these processes. Interestingly, FA assay with lipid II probe has the advantage over moenomycin based probe to potentially identify compounds that interfere with both donor and acceptor sites of the aPBPs GTase as well as compounds that bind to lipid II.

However, it is unknown if induction of immune priming in larval stages protects against dengue virus (DENV) infections in adult mosquitoes. In this work, we primed larval instar 3rd of Aedes aegypti with inactive dengue virus, producing adult mosquitoes with i) an enhanced antiviralimmune response; ii) a reduction in the load and replication of RNA of dengue virus (DENV); iii) a decline in viral infective particles production. Adult mosquitoes previously primed during larval stages overexpressed RNA interference (RNAi) markers Argonaute2 (AGO2) and Dicer2 (DCR2). We also observed interindividual variations of DENV infection in adult mosquitoes, indicating a heterogeneous response to DENV infection in the same mosquito strain. However, mosquitoes primed during larval stages appear to control the infection, reducing the viral load. The overexpression of interferonlike factors (VAGO) and AGO2 in the pupa stage suggests a fast activation of antiviral mechanisms after immune priming in larvae, creating a condition in which adult mosquitoes are resistant to the pathogen in the posterior exposure.",Valeria Vargas; Jorge CimeCastillo; Humberto LanzMendoza,RNAi; Viral infection,"National Institute of Public Health, Center for Research on Infectious Diseases, Cuernavaca, Mexico; Postgraduate in Biological Sciences, National Autonomous University of Mexico, Av.

As each cell has its own circadian clock, we hypothesized that sets of cells with different functions would have distinct rhythmic behaviour. To test this, we investigated whether different organs in fieldgrown sugarcane follow the same rhythms in transcription. We assayed the transcriptomes of three organs during a day: leaf, a source organ; internodes 1 and 2, sink organs focused on cell division and elongation; and internode 5, a sink organ focused on sucrose storage. The leaf had twice as many rhythmic transcripts (68%) as internodes, and the rhythmic transcriptomes of the internodes were more like each other than to those of the leaves. Among the transcripts expressed in all organs, only 7.4% showed the same rhythmic pattern. Surprisingly, the central oscillators of these organs  the networks that generate circadian rhythms  had similar dynamics, albeit with different amplitudes. The differences in rhythmic transcriptomes probably arise from amplitude differences in tissuespecific circadian clocks and different sensitivities to environmental cues, highlighted by the sampling under field conditions. The vast differences suggest that we must study tissuespecific circadian clocks in order to understand how the circadian clock increases the fitness of the whole plant.",Luiza Lane de Barros Dantas; Felipe Marcelo AlmeidaJesus; Natalia Oliveira de Lima; Cicero AlvesLima; Milton Yutaka NishiyamaJr; Monalisa Sampaio Carneiro; Glaucia Mendes Souza; Carlos Takeshi Hotta,Molecular biology; Plant signalling,"Departamento de Bioquimica, Instituto de Quimica, Universidade de Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brazil; Max Planck Institute for Molecular Plant Physiology, PotsdamGolm, Germany; Departamento de Bioquimica, Instituto de Quimica, Universidade de Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brazil; Departamento de Bioquimica, Instituto de Quimica, Universidade de Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brazil; Departamento de Bioquimica, Instituto de Quimica, Universidade de Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brazil; Laboratorio Especial de Toxicologia Aplicada, Instituto Butantan, Sao Paulo, Brazil; Departamento de Biotecnologia e Producao Vegetal e Animal, Centro de Ciencias Agrarias, Universidade Federal de Sao Carlos, Sao Carlos, Brazil; Departamento de Bioquimica, Instituto de Quimica, Universidade de Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brazil; Departamento de Bioquimica, Instituto de Quimica, Universidade de Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brazil"

Retinal mitochondria remain damaged and vicious cycle of free radicals continues to selfpropagate. DNA methylation suppresses gene expression, and diabetes activates DNA methylation machinery. Our aim was to investigate the role of DNA methylation in continued compromised mitochondrial dynamics and genomic stability in diabetic retinopathy. Using retinal endothelial cells, incubated in 20 mM glucose for four days, followed by 5 mM glucose for four days, and retinal microvessels from streptozotocininduced diabetic rats in poor glycemia for four months, followed by normal glycemia for four additional months, DNA methylation of mitochondrial fusion and mismatch repair proteins, Mfn2 and Mlh1 respectively, was determined. Retinopathy was detected in trypsindigested microvasculature. Reinstitution of good glycemia had no beneficial effect on hypermethylation of Mfn2 and Mlh1 and retinal function (electroretinogram), and the  retinopathy continued to progress. However, intervention of good glycemia directly with DNA methylation inhibitors (Azacytidine or Dnmt1siRNA), prevented Mfn2 and Mlh1 hypermethylation, and ameliorated retinal dysfunction and diabetic retinopathy. Thus, direct regulation of DNA methylation can preventreverse diabetic retinopathy by maintaining mitochondrial dynamics and DNA stability, and prevent retinal functional damage.",Renu A.

In order to allow the destruction of our institute's stocks of RPV while maintaining the ability to recover the various viruses if ever required, we have determined the full genome sequence of all our distinct samples of RPV, including 51 wild type viruses and examples of three different types of vaccine strain. Examination of the sequences of these virus isolates has shown that the African isolates form a single disparate clade, rather than two separate clades, which is more in accord with the known history of the virus in Africa. We have also identified two groups of goatpassaged viruses which have acquired an extra 6 bases in the long untranslated region between the M and F protein coding sequences, and shown that, for more than half the genomes sequenced, translation of the F protein requires translational frameshift or nonstandard translation initiation.

4d055ecfb2594030ac82e86fd9dc51f7,Appraising the role of circulating concentrations of micronutrients in epithelial ovarian cancer risk: A Mendelian randomization analysis,"To determine the causality of micronutrients concentrations and risk of ovarian cancer using the Mendelian randomization approach. Analyses were conducted using summary statistics data for SNPs robustly associated with concentrations of thirteen micronutrients (iron, copper, zinc, calcium, magnesium, phosphorus, selenium, vitamin A, carotene, vitamin B6, vitamin B12, vitamin E, folate). The corresponding data for ovarian cancer were obtained from the Ovarian Cancer Association Consortium (25,509 cases and 40,941 controls). In standard Mendelian randomization analysis, the odds ratios (OR) of invasive epithelial ovarian cancer were 0.14 (95% CI, 0.030.70; P  0.02) per 0.1 mmolL (about one standard deviation, SD) increase in genetically predicted magnesium concentration, 1.04 (95% CI, 1.001.09; P  0.03) per 0.3 molliter (about one SD) increase in genetically predicted carotene concentration. The OR of low malignant potential tumours were 0.82 (95% CI, 0.760.90; P  1.01  105) per 0.3 molliter (about one SD) increase in carotene concentration, 1.42 (95% CI, 1.211.68; P  3  105) per 153 pmolL (about one SD) increase in vitamin B12 concentration, 0.21 (95% CI, 0.060.76; P  0.02) per 6 mgL (about one SD) increase in vitamin E concentration. No significant associations of other micronutrients and ovarian cancer were observed. This study found that an increased risk of invasive epithelial ovarian cancer was observed with a genetically higher concentration of carotene, whereas a decreased risk of invasive epithelial ovarian cancer was found with a higher concentration of magnesium. As for low malignant potential tumours, increased concentration of vitamin B12 could increase the risk of low malignant potential tumours, while increased concentrations of carotene and vitamin E could lower the risk of low malignant potential tumours.",Yan Guo; Yunlong Lu; Hongchuan Jin,Epidemiology; Genetics research,"School of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China; Laboratory of Cancer Biology, Key Lab of Biotherapy in Zhejiang, Sir Run Run Shaw Hospital, Medical School of Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China; School of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China; Laboratory of Cancer Biology, Key Lab of Biotherapy in Zhejiang, Sir Run Run Shaw Hospital, Medical School of Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China"

We investigated the influence of composition and substrate temperature on the thinfilm microstructure and transport properties, by varying the tellurium (Te) concentration in the thin films as well as the substrate temperature during deposition (room temperature (RT) and 300 C). Thin films prepared with an RT substrate were further annealed at 264 C to obtain crystallized thin films with high phase purity. Columnar thin films with large grains and a standard multioriented crystal structure were obtained when thin films were deposited on substrates heated to 300 C. Thin films deposited at RT and subsequently annealed at 264 C had a dense, layered microstructure, with a preferential caxis or (00 l) texture as the compositions approached phase stoichiometry. The temperature dependence of the thermoelectric properties was measured, and variations were interpreted in terms of the deviation from stoichiometry and the obtained microstructure. A maximum power factor (PF) of 0.87 mWm  K2 was obtained for offstoichiometric 65.0 at% Te thin film, which was the highest among the samples deposited at high substrate temperatures. A higher PF of 1.0 mWm  K2 was found for offstoichiometric thin films with 64.5 at% Te, which was deposited at RT and subsequently annealed. The improvement of thermoelectric power in films containing excess Te could be related to energy dependent carrier scattering at the Sb2Te3Te interface.",Aziz Ahmed; Seungwoo Han,Materials for energy and catalysis; Materials science,"Department of NanoMechatronics, Korea University of Science and Technology (UST), 217 Gajeongro, Yuseonggu, Daejeon, Republic of Korea; Department of NanoMechanics, Korea Institute of Machinery and Materials (KIMM), 156 Gajeongbukro, Yuseonggu, Daejeon, Republic of Korea; Department of NanoMechatronics, Korea University of Science and Technology (UST), 217 Gajeongro, Yuseonggu, Daejeon, Republic of Korea; Department of NanoMechanics, Korea Institute of Machinery and Materials (KIMM), 156 Gajeongbukro, Yuseonggu, Daejeon, Republic of Korea"

We determined the reliability of sEMG variables in 33 patients with DS. EMG signals were recorded at rest as well as during maximum voluntary clenching and maximum habitual intercuspation (MHI). The signals were analyzed considering the amplitude in the root mean square (RMS), mean frequency (MNF), median frequency (MDF) and approximate entropy (ApEn). The intraclass correlation (ICC2,1) for the three trials recorded during MHI in the two sessions (test and retest) revealed excellent intrasession and intersession reliability (ICC2,1  0.76 to 0.97) for all sEMG variables and muscles. In the rest position, excellent reliability was found for RMS and ApEn (ICC2,1  0.75 to 1.00) and good to excellent reliability was found for MDF and MNF (ICC2,1  0.64 to 0.93).

778b8af7246b4fda83c27af9f252ace2,"Interplay between Cellular Uptake, Intracellular Localization and the Cell Death Mechanism in TriphenylamineMediated Photoinduced Cell Death","Triphenylamines (TPAs) were previously shown to trigger cell death under prolonged one or twophoton illumination. Their initial subcellular localization, before prolonged illumination, is exclusively cytoplasmic and they translocate to the nucleus upon photoactivation. However, depending on their structure, they display significant differences in terms of precise initial localization and subsequent photoinduced cell death mechanism. Here, we investigated the structural features of TPAs that influence cell death by studying a series of molecules differing by the number and chemical nature of vinyl branches. All compounds triggered cell death upon onephoton excitation, however to different extents, the nature of the electron acceptor group being determinant for the overall cell death efficiency. Photobleaching susceptibility was also an important parameter for discriminating efficientinefficient compounds in twophoton experiments. Furthermore, the number of branches, but not their chemical nature, was crucial for determining the cellular uptake mechanism of TPAs and their intracellular fate. The uptake of all TPAs is an active endocytic process but two and threebranch compounds are taken up via distinct endocytosis pathways, clathrindependent or independent (predominantly caveolaedependent), respectively. Twobranch TPAs preferentially target mitochondria and photoinduce both apoptosis and a proper necrotic process, whereas threebranch TPAs preferentially target late endosomes and photoinduce apoptosis only.",Rahima Chennoufi; NgocDuong Trinh; Francoise Simon; Guillaume Bordeau; Delphine NaudMartin; Albert Moussaron; Bertrand Cinquin; Houcine Bougherara; Beatrice Rambaud; Patrick Tauc; Celine Frochot; MariePaule TeuladeFichou; Florence MahuteauBetzer; Eric Deprez,Apoptosis; Chemical tools,"Laboratory of Biology and Applied Pharmacology (LBPA), CNRS UMR8113, IDA FR3242, ENS ParisSaclay, Universite ParisSaclay, GifsurYvette, France; Laboratory of Biology and Applied Pharmacology (LBPA), CNRS UMR8113, IDA FR3242, ENS ParisSaclay, Universite ParisSaclay, GifsurYvette, France; Laboratory of Biology and Applied Pharmacology (LBPA), CNRS UMR8113, IDA FR3242, ENS ParisSaclay, Universite ParisSaclay, GifsurYvette, France; UMR9187, CNRS, INSERM, Institut Curie, PSL Research University, Universite ParisSaclay, Orsay, France; Laboratoire des IMRCP, Universite de Toulouse, CNRS UMR5623, Universite ToulouseIII  Paul Sabatier, Toulouse, France; UMR9187, CNRS, INSERM, Institut Curie, PSL Research University, Universite ParisSaclay, Orsay, France; LRGP, UMR7274 CNRSUniversite de Lorraine, Nancy, France; Laboratory of Biology and Applied Pharmacology (LBPA), CNRS UMR8113, IDA FR3242, ENS ParisSaclay, Universite ParisSaclay, GifsurYvette, France; Institut Cochin, INSERM U1016CNRS UMR8104Universite Paris Descartes, Sorbonne Paris Cite, Paris, France; Institut de Recherches Servier SA, CroissysurSeine, France; Laboratory of Biology and Applied Pharmacology (LBPA), CNRS UMR8113, IDA FR3242, ENS ParisSaclay, Universite ParisSaclay, GifsurYvette, France; Laboratory of Biology and Applied Pharmacology (LBPA), CNRS UMR8113, IDA FR3242, ENS ParisSaclay, Universite ParisSaclay, GifsurYvette, France; LRGP, UMR7274 CNRSUniversite de Lorraine, Nancy, France; UMR9187, CNRS, INSERM, Institut Curie, PSL Research University, Universite ParisSaclay, Orsay, France; UMR9187, CNRS, INSERM, Institut Curie, PSL Research University, Universite ParisSaclay, Orsay, France; Laboratory of Biology and Applied Pharmacology (LBPA), CNRS UMR8113, IDA FR3242, ENS ParisSaclay, Universite ParisSaclay, GifsurYvette, France"
a0df42a9ef604b3d945e2528e801d297,Continuity of chronic predation risk determines changes in prey physiology,"Prey reconfigure their physiology to avoid costs of prolonged predator pressure. However, these changes might not occur under periodic predation risk, with repeating acute phases. To test the effect of predation risk continuity on changes in prey physiology, we exposed amphipods: Dikerogammarus villosus and Gammarus jazdzewskii to periodic and constant predation cue. After one week, we measured: cellular defence systems: total antioxidant status (TAS), heat shock proteins (Hsp70); intracellular damage marker: lipid peroxidation (TBARS); condition index: glycogen concentration. Predator presence reduced TAS level in G. jazdzewskii independent of its continuity and in D. villosus after periodic exposure. Amphipods showed downregulation of Hsp70 when exposed to periodic (D. villosus) or constant (G. jazdzewskii) predation risk. Exposure to predators reduced TBARS level in D. villosus (irrespective of the continuity) and G. jazdzewskii (periodic exposure). Glycogen concentration in both species was not affected by predator presence. Thus, the continuity of the predator cue shaped prey physiology reconfiguration, optimizing costs of physiological adjustments under challenging conditions. Nevertheless, the lack of negative consequences of the prolonged exposure to the predator cue, whether constant or periodic, shows that amphipods can thrive under chronic predation risk, which is a constant part of the wild environment.",ukasz Jermacz; Hanna Kletkiewicz; Anna Nowakowska; Anna DzierzynskaBiaonczyk; Maciej Klimiuk; Jarosaw Kobak,Ecology; Ecophysiology; Freshwater ecology; Invasive species,"Nicolaus Copernicus University, Faculty of Biology and Veterinary Sciences, Department of Invertebrate Zoology and Parasitology, Lwowska 1, Torun, Poland; Nicolaus Copernicus University, Faculty of Biology and Veterinary Sciences, Department of Ecology and Biogeography, Lwowska 1, Torun, Poland; Nicolaus Copernicus University, Faculty of Biology and Veterinary Sciences, Department of Animal Physiology, Lwowska 1, Torun, Poland; Nicolaus Copernicus University, Faculty of Biology and Veterinary Sciences, Department of Animal Physiology, Lwowska 1, Torun, Poland; Nicolaus Copernicus University, Faculty of Biology and Veterinary Sciences, Department of Invertebrate Zoology and Parasitology, Lwowska 1, Torun, Poland; Nicolaus Copernicus University, Faculty of Biology and Veterinary Sciences, Department of Animal Physiology, Lwowska 1, Torun, Poland; Nicolaus Copernicus University, Faculty of Biology and Veterinary Sciences, Department of Invertebrate Zoology and Parasitology, Lwowska 1, Torun, Poland"

Sixhundred fiftyseven KTRs from 526 DDs were included from four transplant centers. We divided KTRs into elderlyKTR and youngKTR groups based on age 60 and each group was subdivided into high or lowKDPI subgroup based on KDPI score of 65%. We compared shortterm and longterm clinical outcomes among those four subgroups (low KDPIyoung KTR, low KDPIelderlyKTR, high KDPIyoungKTR, high KDPIelderlyKTR). In shortterm outcomes including acute rejection, BK virus and CMV infection, there was no significant difference among the four subgroups. In the longterm outcomes, the development of cardiovascular disease was higher in the high KDPIelderlyKTR group than the other groups. In comparison of allograft survival rate, the high KDPIyoung KTR subgroup showed highest risk for allograft failure and there was significant interaction between highKDPI donors and youngKTR on allograft survival rate (P  0.002). However, there was no significant difference in comparison of the patient survival rate.

In mice, FGF21 is thought to cause weight loss by stimulating thermogenesis, but whether FGF21 increases energy expenditure (EE) in primates is unclear. Here, we explore the transcriptional response and gene networks active in adipose tissue of rhesus macaques following FGF21induced weight loss. Genes related to thermogenesis responded inconsistently to FGF21 treatment and weight loss. However, expression of gene modules involved in triglyceride (TG) synthesis and adipogenesis decreased, and this was associated with greater weight loss. Conversely, expression of innate immune cell markers was increased posttreatment and was associated with greater weight loss. A lipogenesis gene module associated with weight loss was evaluated by testing the function of member genes in mice. Overexpression of NRG4 reduced weight gain in dietinduced obese mice, while overexpression of ANGPTL8 resulted in elevated TG levels in lean mice. These observations provide evidence for a shifting balance of lipid storage and metabolism due to FGF21induced weight loss in the nonhuman primate model, and do not fully recapitulate increased EE seen in rodent and in vitro studies. These discrepancies may reflect interspecies differences or complex interplay of FGF21 activity and counterregulatory mechanisms.",Sara A. Murray; Louise S. Dalbge; Karalee Baquero; Christina A.

6671fe1d901d4e66b402755f1b9c52bb,Population history in Okinawa based on JC virus and ALDH2 genotypes,"It is widely known that people in Okinawa originated from the Jomon people, and are generally tolerant to alcohol. However, some individuals in mainland Japan lack alcohol tolerance due to a mutation in the human mitochondrial aldehyde dehydrogenase 2 (ALDH2) gene. Furthermore, the JC virus (JCV) genotype MY, which is related to the Jomon people, has not been found in Okinawa. In this study, to analyze the origin of the Okinawan people, we investigated the relationship between the JCV genotype and ALDH2 genotype. We collected 108 JCV positive samples from Okinawa. Only CY genotype JCV, and not the MY genotype, was detected. Among JCVpositive samples, a variant of ALDH2 (GluLys heterozygote) was detected in 31 samples (29%) and wildtype ALDH2 (GluGlu homozygote) was detected in 77 samples (71%). Another variant of ALDH2 (LysLys homozygote) was not detected. Among carriers of CY genotype JCV, wildtype ALDH2 was much more frequent in people living in Okinawa than in mainland Japan (P  0.05). Our results suggested that the original inhabitants of Okinawa were people who carried MY genotype JCV and wildtype ALDH2; and that after the extinction of these original inhabitants, people who carried CY genotype JCV and wildtype ALDH2 migrated to the area. Due to the founder effect, CY genotype JCV and wildtype ALDH2 became dominant.

In the present study, assessment of the level of radon over the three lithological units upon which the residential areas of ObafemiAwolowo University Campus, IleIfe (OAU) was situated was carried out. Soil gas radon concentration measurement was carried out at a constant depth of 0.80 m across the three lithologies (granite gneiss, grey gneiss and mica schist) using a RAD7 electronic radon detector. A total of 138 insitu soil gas radon measurements were carried out. Obtained experimental data were analysed and summarised using descriptive and inferential statistics with statistical significance set at p  0.05. A radon potential map was also developed using existing permeability data of the soils in the area. Soil radon concentration varied across the different lithologies ranging from 0.04 kBqm3  190 kBqm3 with a mean value of 14 kBqm3. The mean value of Rn222 concentration obtained in the three lithologies are 3.5  5.9, 11.5  25.8 and 28.4  37.4 kBqm3 for granite gneiss, grey gneiss and mica schist respectively. There is a statistically significant difference (p  0.001) in the mean concentration of radon222 measured on the three lithologies.

As cellular mechanisms of taste learning, longterm potentiation (LTP) at glutamatergic synapses is well studied. However, little is known about longterm changes of synaptic efficacy at GABAergic synapses in the insular cortex. Here, we examined the synaptic mechanisms of longterm plasticity at GABAergic synapses in layer V pyramidal neurons of the mouse insular cortex. In response to a prolonged highfrequency stimulation (HFS), GABAergic synapses displayed endocannabinod (eCB)mediated longterm depression (LTDGABA). When cannabinoid 1 receptors (CB1Rs) were blocked by a CB1R antagonist, the same stimuli caused LTP at GABAergic synapses (LTPGABA) which was mediated by production of nitric oxide (NO) via activation of NMDA receptors. Intriguingly, NO signaling was necessary for the induction of LTDGABA. In the presence of leptin which blocks CB1 signaling, the prolonged HFS caused LTPGABA which was mediated by NO signaling. These results indicate that longterm plasticity at GABAergic synapses in the insular cortex can be modulated by combined effects of eCB and NO signaling. These forms of GABAergic synaptic plasticity in the insular cortex may be crucial synaptic mechanisms in taste learning.",Hiroki Toyoda,Neuroscience; Physiology,"Department of Oral Physiology, Osaka University Graduate School of Dentistry, Osaka, Japan"

Next, the percentage rate analysis of the radiographic bone loss combined the tooth longaxis with the periodontal bone and CEJ levels. Using the percentage rate, we could automatically classify the periodontal bone loss. This classification was used for periodontitis staging according to the new criteria proposed at the 2017 World Workshop on the Classification of Periodontal and PeriImplant Diseases and Conditions. The Pearson correlation coefficient of the automatic method with the diagnoses by radiologists was 0.73 overall for the whole jaw (p  0.01), and the intraclass correlation value 0.91 overall for the whole jaw (p  0.01). The novel hybrid framework that combined deep learning architecture and the conventional CAD approach demonstrated high accuracy and excellent reliability in the automatic diagnosis of periodontal bone loss and staging of periodontitis.",HyukJoon Chang; SangJeong Lee; TaeHoon Yong; NanYoung Shin; BongGeun Jang; JoEun Kim; KyungHoe Huh; SamSun Lee; MinSuk Heo; SoonChul Choi; TaeIl Kim; WonJin Yi,Biomedical engineering; Periodontitis,"Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Radiology, School of Dentistry and Dental Research Institute, Seoul National University, Seoul, Korea; Department of Biomedical Radiation Sciences, Graduate School of Convergence Science and Technology, Seoul National University, Seoul, Korea; Department of Biomedical Radiation Sciences, Graduate School of Convergence Science and Technology, Seoul National University, Seoul, Korea; Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Radiology, School of Dentistry and Dental Research Institute, Seoul National University, Seoul, Korea; Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Radiology, School of Dentistry and Dental Research Institute, Seoul National University, Seoul, Korea; Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Radiology, Seoul National University Dental Hospital, Seoul, Korea; Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Radiology, School of Dentistry and Dental Research Institute, Seoul National University, Seoul, Korea; Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Radiology, School of Dentistry and Dental Research Institute, Seoul National University, Seoul, Korea; Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Radiology, School of Dentistry and Dental Research Institute, Seoul National University, Seoul, Korea; Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Radiology, School of Dentistry and Dental Research Institute, Seoul National University, Seoul, Korea; Department of Periodontology, School of Dentistry and Dental Research Institute, Seoul National University, Seoul, Korea; Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Radiology, School of Dentistry and Dental Research Institute, Seoul National University, Seoul, Korea; Department of Biomedical Radiation Sciences, Graduate School of Convergence Science and Technology, Seoul National University, Seoul, Korea"

Methods: Ddimer was detected in consecutive 813 patients entering the emergency department of our hospital, for the patients with Ddimer levels above 5.0 gmL, the final diagnoses and 28day mortality were confirmed, and the levels of thrombomodulin (TM), thrombinantithrombin complex (TAT) and plasminantiplasmin complex (PAP) on admission were detected. Results: There were 148 emergency patients with Ddimer levels higher than 5.0 gmL mainly due to sepsis, malignancy, trauma, venous thromboembolism (VTE), cerebrovascular accident, and so on. Both of the TM and TAT levels among these diagnoses were significantly different (p  0.001). The elevated TM (13.3 TUmL) had a predictive value of 96.0% for excluding VTE, and the normal TM had a predictive value of 90.4% for excluding sepsis. The overall 28day mortality of these patients with Ddimer 5.0 ugmL was 14.2%, the TAT level on admission was independently associated with 28day mortality (odds ratio 1.014, 95% CI 1.0011.027, P  0.030). Conclusions: The medical emergencies associated with markedly elevated Ddimer levels were revealed, specific markers of endothelial dysfunction and thrombin generation measured by automatic analyzer have the potential to distinguish diagnoses and predict outcomes in these patients.",Ning Tang; Yinyin Pan; Chao Xu; Dengju Li,Biochemistry; Biomarkers,"Department of Clinical Laboratory, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China; Department of Clinical Laboratory, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China; Department of Clinical Laboratory, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China; Department of Hematology, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"
03fb35d3047641c4b7cebf76594ed64e,Multimodal chemomagnetophototaxis of 3G CNTbots to power fuel cells,"We report the development of a 3G microswimmer, namely, CNTbot, capable of undergoing acid, alkali, magneto and phototaxis inside acidic or alkaline baths of peroxide fuel andor water. The use of carboxylfunctionalised multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) facilitated the propulsion of CNTbots in an alkalinewater solution by ejecting carbondioxide bubbles. Furthermore, doping of magnetite nanoparticles (FeONPs), ferrous ions (Fe2) and titanium dioxide nanoparticles (TiONPs) induces magnetic, chemical and photonic modes of propulsion. While FeONPs stimulated magnetotaxis at a rate of up to ~10 body lengths per second under the influence of a bar magnet, chemotaxis of a similar speed in a peroxide fuel was achieved by bubblepropulsion of oxygen gas originating from the Fenton reaction. In addition, the lightstimulated photoFenton reaction led to phototaxis of CNTbots. A thin coating of magnesium imparted a halffaced Janus appearance to the CNTbots, which facilitated motion in normal or acidic water media through the ejection of hydrogen gas bubbles. This chemotaxis could be transformed into pHstimulated directional motion by establishing an acid or alkali concentration gradient across the peroxide andor water baths. The capacity of CNTbots to produce oxygen (hydrogen) bubbles in peroxide (acidic water) fuel was exploited to power a PEM fuel cell to generate electricity. The pure oxygen and hydrogen gases generated by CNTbots in separate chambers were fed directly into the fuel cell in which the incessant motions of the particle facilitated the creation and release of the pure gases to achieve ondemand electricity generation. The motor could also induce dye degradation through advanced oxidation owing to the production of intermediate hydroxyl radicals during the Fenton reaction. Selfpropelling objects have been increasingly used for a wide range of applications. Thus far, the first (1G) and secondgeneration (2G) motors have served the purpose of achieving diverse motions under a directional trigger. A team headed by Shirsendu Mitra and Dipankar Bandyopadhyay at the Indian Institute of Technology Guwahati, India, has developed a thirdgeneration (3G) artificial microswimmer composed of chemically modified multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MW CNTs)namely the CNTbots. Such microbots can move in response to acidic, alkaline, magnetic, and light stimuli. The team used the capacity of the CNTbots to produce pure oxygen and hydrogen, allowing a protonexchange membrane (PEM) fuel cell to generate an electric field. The authors believe that their study highlights the potential of a 3G CNTbot for energy harvesting.",Shirsendu Mitra; Nirmal Roy; Surjendu Maity; Dipankar Bandyopadhyay,Carbon nanotubes and fullerenes; Nanoparticles,"Department of Chemical Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology Guwahati, Guwahati, India; Centre for Nanotechnology, Indian Institute of Technology Guwahati, Guwahati, India; Centre for Nanotechnology, Indian Institute of Technology Guwahati, Guwahati, India; Department of Chemical Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology Guwahati, Guwahati, India; Centre for Nanotechnology, Indian Institute of Technology Guwahati, Guwahati, India"
eea5f484421a4839b129d22db149c8d4,BRAF V600E mutation is a potential therapeutic target for a small subset of synovial sarcoma,"Synovial sarcoma (SS) is an aggressive tumor that most often affects the deep soft tissues in young adults. Intrathoracic SS is rare and is associated with poor outcome, highlighting the urgent need for a novel therapeutic strategy. In the process of clinical sequencing, we identified two patients with intrathoracic SS harboring the BRAF V600E mutation. The patients were women aged 32 and 23 years, and both presented with SS18SSX2positive monophasic SS in the thoracic cavity. BRAF V600E mutations were detected by next generation sequencing, and validated immunohistochemically by diffuse intense positivity to BRAF V600E mutationspecific antibodies. The phosphorylated ERK (pERK) immunohistochemistry result was also positive. One patient received a combination therapy of dabrafenib and trametinib, which led to tumor shrinkage. However, the tumor growth progressed 7.5 months later with an additional NRAS Q61K mutation. Immunohistochemical screening of 67 archival SS tumor samples failed to identify additional samples with BRAF V600E mutation. However, 32% of BRAF V600Enegative cases was positive for pERK, and one of the six tumors showing the highest pERK expression harbored an FGFR2activating mutation. This is the first report of targetable BRAF mutation in a small subset of SS.

This study investigated subcortical morphometric changes 6 months after switching treatment to clozapine in patients with treatmentresistant schizophrenia compared with healthy volunteers, and the relationships between longitudinal volume changes and clinical variables. In total, 1.5T MRI images were acquired at baseline before commencing clozapine and again after 6 months of treatment for 33 patients with treatmentresistant schizophrenia and 31 controls, and processed using the longitudinal pipeline of Freesurfer v.5.3.0. Twoway repeated MANCOVA was used to assess group differences in subcortical volumes over time and partial correlations to determine association with clinical variables. Whereas no significant subcortical volume differences were found between patients and controls at baseline (F(8,52)  1.79; p  0.101), there was a significant interaction between time, group and structure (F(7,143)  52.54; p  0.001). Corrected posthoc analyses demonstrated that patients had significant enlargement of lateral ventricles (F(1,59)  48.89; p  0.001) and reduction of thalamus (F(1,59)  34.85; p  0.001), caudate (F(1,59)  59.35; p  0.001), putamen (F(1,59)  87.20; p  0.001) and hippocampus (F(1,59)  14.49; p  0.001) volumes.

To substantiate evidence that the brain structure of TIs differs from male and female, we use a combined multivariate and univariate approach. Gray matter segments resulting from voxelbased morphometry preprocessing of N  1753 cisgender (CG) healthy participants were used to train (N  1402) and validate (20% holdout N  351) a supportvector machine classifying the biological sex. As a second validation, we classified N  1104 patients with depression. A third validation was performed using the matched CG sample of the transgender women (TW) application sample. Subsequently, the classifier was applied to N  26 TW. Finally, we compared brain volumes of CGmen, women, and TWprepost treatment crosssex hormone treatment (CHT) in a univariate analysis controlling for sexual orientation, age, and total brain volume. The application of our biological sex classifier to the transgender sample resulted in a significantly lower true positive rate (TPRmale  56.0%). The TPR did not differ between CGindividuals with (TPRmale  86.9%) and without depression (TPRmale  88.5%). The univariate analysis of the transgender applicationsample revealed that TWprepost treatment show brainstructural differences from CGwomen and CGmen in the putamen and insula, as well as the wholebrain analysis. Our results support the hypothesis that brain structure in TW differs from brain structure of their biological sex (male) as well as their perceived gender (female).

We conducted the first systematic review and metaanalysis of the adverse effects of CBD across all medical indications. Doubleblind randomized placebocontrolled clinical trials lasting 7 days were included. Twelve trials contributed data from 803 participants to the metaanalysis. Compared with placebo, CBD was associated with an increased likelihood of withdrawal for any reason (OR 2.61, 95% CI: 1.384.96) or due to adverse events (OR 2.65, 95% CI: 1.046.80), any serious adverse event (OR 2.30, 95% CI: 1.184.48), serious adverse events related to abnormal liver function tests (OR 11.19, 95% CI: 2.0960.02) or pneumonia (OR 5.37, 95% CI: 1.1724.65), any adverse event (OR 1.55, 95% CI: 1.032.33), adverse events due to decreased appetite (OR 3.56, 95% CI: 1.946.53), diarrhoea (OR 2.61, 95% CI: 1.464.67), somnolence (OR 2.23, 95% CI: 1.074.64) and sedation (OR 4.21, 95% CI: 1.1815.01). Associations with abnormal liver function tests, somnolence, sedation and pneumonia were limited to childhood epilepsy studies, where CBD may have interacted with other medications such as clobazam andor sodium valproate. After excluding studies in childhood epilepsy, the only adverse outcome associated with CBD treatment was diarrhoea (OR 5.03, 95% CI: 1.4417.61). In summary, the available data from clinical trials suggest that CBD is well tolerated and has relatively few serious adverse effects, however interactions with other medications should be monitored carefully.

b57b4719764043a38f3d4c65de0e35f0,Nuclear factor IX promotes glioblastoma development through transcriptional activation of Ezrin,"Enhanced migration is pivotal for the malignant development of glioblastoma (GBM), but the underlying molecular mechanism that modulates the migration of the GBM cells remains obscure. Here we show that nuclear factor IX (NFIX) is significantly upregulated in human GBM lesions compared with normal or lowgrade gliomas. NFIX deficiency impairs the migration of GBM cells and inhibits the tumor growth in the hippocampus of immunodeficient nude mice. Mechanistically, NFIX silencing suppresses the expression of Ezrin, a protein that crosslinks actin cytoskeleton and plasma membrane, which is also positively correlated with GBM malignancy. NFIX depletion induced migration inhibition of GBM cells can be rescued by the replenishment of Ezrin. Furthermore, we identify a NFIX response element (RE) between 840 and 825 bp in the promoter region of the Ezrin gene. Altogether, our findings show, for the first time that NFIX can transcriptionally upregulate the expression of Ezrin and contribute to the enhanced migration of GBM cells, suggesting that NFIX is a potential target for GBM therapy.",Zhuohao Liu; Ruixiang Ge; Jiayi Zhou; Xinzhi Yang; Kenneth Kingyip Cheng; Jingli Tao; Dinglan Wu; Jie Mao,Cancer therapy; CNS cancer,"Department of Neurosurgery, Shenzhen Hospital, Southern Medical University, Shenzhen, China; Department of Neurosurgery, Yijishan Hospital, Wannan Medical College, Wuhu, China; Shenzhen Key Laboratory of Viral Oncology, The Clinical Innovation  Research Centre, Shenzhen Hospital, Southern Medical University, Shenzhen, China; Department of Neurosurgery, Shenzhen Hospital, Southern Medical University, Shenzhen, China; Department of Health Technology and Informatics, The Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Hong Kong, China; Department of Pathology, Shenzhen Hospital, Southern Medical University, Shenzhen, China; Shenzhen Key Laboratory of Viral Oncology, The Clinical Innovation  Research Centre, Shenzhen Hospital, Southern Medical University, Shenzhen, China; Department of Neurosurgery, Shenzhen Hospital, Southern Medical University, Shenzhen, China; Department of Neurosurgery, Yijishan Hospital, Wannan Medical College, Wuhu, China"

But its efficacy requires improvement, it is imperative to seek therapeutic strategies that combine sorafenib with other anticancer agents. In this study we investigated the synergistic anticancer effect of combining sorafenib and artesunate, an antimalaria drug derivative, against HCC in vitro and in vivo. We first showed that artesunate (1100 M) alone dosedependently inhibited the proliferation of five HCC cell lines tested with IC50 values of around 100 M. Artesunate treatment dosedependently increased the ROS level in both HuH7 and Hep3B cells; addition of NAC significantly ameliorated the antiproliferation effect of artesunate against HuH7 and Hep3B cells. Then we demonstrated that combination of sorafenib and artesunate exerted synergistic antiproliferation effect and induced synergistic apoptosis in HCC cell lines. In nude mice bearing Hep3B xenografts, combined administration of sorafenib and artesunate significantly enhanced the suppression on tumor growth. We further revealed that sorafenib dosedependently decreased the levels of pERK and pSTAT3, whereas artesunate markedly increased the levels of pERK and pSTAT3 in HuH7 and Hep3B cells. When used in combination, sorafenib abolished artesunateelevated levels of pSTAT3 and pERK. Moreover, pharmacological inhibition of ERK by inhibitor PD0325901 or STAT3 by inhibitor Stattic markedly enhanced the anticancer activity of artesunate, suggesting that suppression of ERK and STAT3 signaling by sorafenib contributes to the synergistic anticancer activity against HCC caused by combination of sorafenib and artesunate.

In this study, we included Chinese young adults who underwent Cirrus spectral domainoptical coherence tomography (SDOCT). SDOCT was used to measure average and minimum GCIPL thickness, and GCIPL thickness at all sectors. Subfoveal choroidal thickness (CT), axial length (AL), and spherical equivalents (SE) were also measured. A total of 348 eyes were included in the analysis. Average GCIPL thickness showed a significant difference between myopes and emmetropes, with 87.89  3.65 m for emmetropic groups and 82.65  4.96 m for myopic groups. The GCIPL thickness was significantly thinner in myopia than in emmetropia at all locations (P  0.05), affirming that myopia was associated with thinner GCIPL thickness (P  0.001). The mean subfoveal CT also showed a significant difference between myopes and emmetropes, with 330.57  9.43 m for emmetropic groups and 265.98  4.12 m for myopic groups. GCIPL (OR 0.863, 95% CI, 0.7850.949), AL (OR 2.499, 95% CI, 1.5324.075) and intraocular pressure (IOP) (OR 1.250, 95% CI, 1.0861.438) revealed significant associations with myopia.

19e7fc51f5e54e21a7462ada2e32c473,Replacements of small by largeranged species scale up to diversity loss in Europe's temperate forest biome,"Biodiversity time series reveal global losses and accelerated redistributions of species, but no net loss in local species richness. To better understand how these patterns are linked, we quantify how individual species trajectories scale up to diversity changes using data from 68 vegetation resurvey studies of seminatural forests in Europe. Herblayer species with small geographic ranges are being replaced by more widely distributed species, and our results suggest that this is due less to species abundances than to species nitrogen niches. Nitrogen deposition accelerates the extinctions of smallranged, nitrogenefficient plants and colonization by broadly distributed, nitrogendemanding plants (including nonnatives). Despite no net change in species richness at the spatial scale of a study site, the losses of smallranged species reduce biomescale (gamma) diversity. These results provide one mechanism to explain the directional replacement of smallranged species within sites and thus explain patterns of biodiversity change across spatial scales. The loss of biodiversity at the global scale has been difficult to reconcile with observations of no net loss at local scales. Vegetation surveys across European temperate forests show that this may be explained by the replacement of smallranged species with largeranged ones, driven by nitrogen deposition.",Ingmar R.

9d3dae5bb6fe4190be76261c1fccadb1,Singleatom RhNdoped carbon electrocatalyst for formic acid oxidation,"To meet the requirements of potential applications, it is of great importance to explore new catalysts for formic acid oxidation that have both ultrahigh mass activity and CO resistance. Here, we successfully synthesize atomically dispersed Rh on Ndoped carbon (SARhCN) and discover that SARhCN exhibits promising electrocatalytic properties for formic acid oxidation. The mass activity shows 28 and 67fold enhancements compared with stateoftheart PdC and PtC, respectively, despite the low activity of RhC. Interestingly, SARhCN exhibits greatly enhanced tolerance to CO poisoning, and Rh atoms in SARhCN resist sintering after longterm testing, resulting in excellent catalytic stability. Density functional theory calculations suggest that the formate route is more favourable on SARhCN. According to calculations, the high barrier to produce CO, together with the relatively unfavourable binding with CO, contribute to its CO tolerance. Atomically dispersed Rh on Ndoped carbon exhibits 28 and 67fold enhancements compared with stateoftheart PdC and PtC, despite the low activity of RhC.

Here, we directly compare seven methods for singlecell andor singlenucleus profilingselecting representative methods based on their usage and our expertise and resources to prepare librariesincluding two lowthroughput and five highthroughput methods. We tested the methods on three types of samples: cell lines, peripheral blood mononuclear cells and brain tissue, generating 36 libraries in six separate experiments in a single center. To directly compare the methods and avoid processing differences introduced by the existing pipelines, we developed scumi, a flexible computational pipeline that can be used with any singlecell RNAsequencing method. We evaluated the methods for both basic performance, such as the structure and alignment of reads, sensitivity and extent of multiplets, and for their ability to recover known biological information in the samples.

b6d505f3592b4936946bee4e7016a249,Selective covalent targeting of GPX4 using masked nitrileoxide electrophiles,"We recently described glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4) as a promising target for killing therapyresistant cancer cells via ferroptosis. The onset of therapy resistance by multiple types of treatment results in a stable cell state marked by high levels of polyunsaturated lipids and an acquired dependency on GPX4. Unfortunately, all existing inhibitors of GPX4 act covalently via a reactive alkyl chloride moiety that confers poor selectivity and pharmacokinetic properties. Here, we report our discovery that masked nitrileoxide electrophiles, which have not been explored previously as covalent cellular probes, undergo remarkable chemical transformations in cells and provide an effective strategy for selective targeting of GPX4. The new GPX4inhibiting compounds we describe exhibit unexpected proteomewide selectivity and, in some instances, vastly improved physiochemical and pharmacokinetic properties compared to existing chloroacetamidebased GPX4 inhibitors. These features make them superior tool compounds for biological interrogation of ferroptosis and constitute starting points for development of improved inhibitors of GPX4.

17239362917b4068879bf1bd5a4a505f,Polygenic and clinical risk scores and their impact on age at onset and prediction of cardiometabolic diseases and common cancers,"Polygenic risk scores (PRSs) have shown promise in predicting susceptibility to common diseases13. We estimated their added value in clinical risk prediction of five common diseases, using largescale biobank data (FinnGen; n  135,300) and the FINRISK study with clinical risk factors to test genomewide PRSs for coronary heart disease, type 2 diabetes, atrial fibrillation, breast cancer and prostate cancer. We evaluated the lifetime risk at different PRS levels, and the impact on disease onset and on prediction together with clinical risk scores. Compared to having an average PRS, having a high PRS contributed 21% to 38% higher lifetime risk, and 4 to 9 years earlier disease onset. PRSs improved model discrimination over age and sex in type 2 diabetes, atrial fibrillation, breast cancer and prostate cancer, and over clinical risk in type 2 diabetes, breast cancer and prostate cancer. In all diseases, PRSs improved reclassification over clinical thresholds, with the largest net reclassification improvements for earlyonset coronary heart disease, atrial fibrillation and prostate cancer. This study provides evidence for the additional value of PRSs in clinical disease prediction. The practical applications of polygenic risk information for stratified screening or for guiding lifestyle and medical interventions in the clinical setting remain to be defined in further studies. In a large and prospective cohort, higher polygenic risk is associated with higher risk and earlier age of onset for cardiometabolic disorders and cancer, and has added value to clinical risk scores in clinical disease prediction.",Nina Mars; Jukka T.

Here we reveal a dynamic mechanism that overturns this conventional understanding by a direct environmental transmission electron microscopy visualization coupled with multiple stateoftheart in situ techniques, which include synchrotron Xray absorption spectroscopy, infrared spectroscopy and theoretical simulations. A NiAu catalytic system, which exhibits a highly selective CO production in CO2 hydrogenation, features an intact ultrathin Au shell over the Ni core before and after the reaction. However, the catalytic performance could not be attributed to the Au shell surface, but rather to the formation of a transient reconstructed alloy surface, promoted by CO adsorption during the reaction. The discovery of such a reversible transformation urges us to reconsider the reaction mechanism beyond the stationary model, and may have important implications not only for coreshell nanoparticles, but also for other welldefined nanocatalysts.

Translocon structures are becoming available, however the dynamics of proteins during membrane translocation remain largely obscure. Here we study, at the singlemolecule level, the folding landscape of a model protein while forced to translocate a transmembrane pore. We use a DNA tag to drive the protein into the hemolysin pore under a quantifiable force produced by an applied electric potential. Using a voltagequench approach we find that the protein fluctuates between the native state and an intermediate in the translocation process at estimated forces as low as 1.9 pN. The fluctuation kinetics provide the free energy landscape as a function of force. We show that our stable, 15 kBT, substrate can be unfolded and translocated with physiological membrane potentials and that selective divalent cation binding may have a profound effect on the translocation kinetics. Rosen et al showed, at the singlemolecule level, that a protein fluctuates between the native and an intermediate state during its forced translocation through a transmembrane pore, and the kinetics of fluctuations provide the free energy landscape as a function of force. They show further that apparently minor events, like the binding of a divalent metal ion, can have major impacts on the translocation kinetics.",Christian Bech Rosen; Hagan Bayley; David RodriguezLarrea,Molecular biophysics; Singlemolecule biophysics,"Department of Chemistry, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK; Novozymes AS, Kgs.

e30c3661212548d0a5c7b8c0f126fe70,Tunable macroscale structural superlubricity in twolayer graphene via strain engineering,"Achieving structural superlubricity in graphitic samples of macroscale size is particularly challenging due to difficulties in sliding large contact areas of commensurate stacking domains. Here, we show the presence of macroscale structural superlubricity between two randomly stacked graphene layers produced by both mechanical exfoliation and chemical vapour deposition. By measuring the shifts of Raman peaks under strain we estimate the values of frictional interlayer shear stress (ILSS) in the superlubricity regime (mm scale) under ambient conditions. The random incommensurate stacking, the presence of wrinkles and the mismatch in the lattice constant between two graphene layers induced by the tensile strain differential are considered responsible for the facile shearing at the macroscale. Furthermore, molecular dynamic simulations show that the stickslip behaviour does not hold for incommensurate chiral shearing directions for which the ILSS decreases substantially, supporting the experimental observations. Our results pave the way for overcoming several limitations in achieving macroscale superlubricity using graphene. Superlubricity in macroscale graphitic samples is hampered by commensurate stacking domains that prevent facile sliding between adjacent graphene layers. Here, the authors show the presence of macroscale structural superlubricity between two randomly stacked graphene layers produced by both mechanical exfoliation and CVD upon the imposition of a tensile stress.",Charalampos Androulidakis; Emmanuel N.

Here we generate 501 metagenomeassembled genomes of NucleoCytoplasmic Large DNA Viruses (NCLDV) from environments around the globe, and analyze their encoded functional capacity. We report a remarkable diversity of metabolic genes in widespread giant viruses, including many involved in nutrient uptake, light harvesting, and nitrogen metabolism. Surprisingly, numerous NCLDV encode the components of glycolysis and the TCA cycle, suggesting that they can reprogram fundamental aspects of their host's central carbon metabolism. Our phylogenetic analysis of NCLDV metabolic genes and their cellular homologs reveals distinct clustering of viral sequences into divergent clades, indicating that these genes are virusspecific and were acquired in the distant past. Overall our findings reveal that giant viruses encode complex metabolic capabilities with evolutionary histories largely independent of cellular life, strongly implicating them as important drivers of global biogeochemical cycles. Nucleocytoplasmic large DNA viruses (NCLDV) exhibit a large genomic repertoire and complex evolutionary history.

f7a4ce77552b4f0e9cf631442fbc1283,Cysteine synthases CYSL1 and CYSL2 mediate C. elegans heritable adaptation to P. vranovensis infection,"Parental exposure to pathogens can prime offspring immunity in diverse organisms. The mechanisms by which this heritable priming occurs are largely unknown. Here we report that the soil bacteria Pseudomonas vranovensis is a natural pathogen of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans and that parental exposure of animals to P. vranovensis promotes offspring resistance to infection. Furthermore, we demonstrate a multigenerational enhancement of progeny survival when three consecutive generations of animals are exposed to P. vranovensis. By investigating the mechanisms by which animals heritably adapt to P. vranovensis infection, we found that parental infection by P. vranovensis results in increased expression of the cysteine synthases cysl1 and cysl2 and the regulator of hypoxia inducible factor rhy1 in progeny, and that these three genes are required for adaptation to P. vranovensis.

In this study, we collect hematoxylin and eosin stained histopathology wholeslide images of 74 TFE3RCC cases (the largest cohort to date) and 74 clear cell RCC cases (ccRCC, the most common RCC subtype) with matched gender and tumor grade. An automatic computational pipeline is implemented to extract image features. Comparative study identifies 52 image features with significant differences between TFE3RCC and ccRCC. Machine learning models are built to distinguish TFE3RCC from ccRCC. Tests of the classification models on an external validation set reveal high accuracy with areas under ROC curve ranging from 0.842 to 0.894. Our results suggest that automatically derived image features can capture subtle morphological differences between TFE3RCC and ccRCC and contribute to a potential guideline for TFE3RCC diagnosis. Translocation renal cell carcinoma is an aggressive form of renal cancer that is often misdiagnosed to other subtypes. Here the authors demonstrated that by using machine learning and HE stained wholeslide images, an accurate diagnose of this particular type of renal cancer can be achieved.",Jun Cheng; Zhi Han; Rohit Mehra; Wei Shao; Michael Cheng; Qianjin Feng; Dong Ni; Kun Huang; Liang Cheng; Jie Zhang,Diagnostic markers; Image processing; Machine learning; Renal cell carcinoma,"NationalRegional Key Technology Engineering Laboratory for Medical Ultrasound, Guangdong Key Laboratory for Biomedical Measurements and Ultrasound Imaging, School of Biomedical Engineering, Health Science Center, Shenzhen University, Shenzhen, China; Department of Medicine, Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, USA; Regenstrief Institute, Indianapolis, USA; Department of Pathology, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, USA; Department of Medicine, Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, USA; Department of Medicine, Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, USA; School of Biomedical Engineering, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou, China; NationalRegional Key Technology Engineering Laboratory for Medical Ultrasound, Guangdong Key Laboratory for Biomedical Measurements and Ultrasound Imaging, School of Biomedical Engineering, Health Science Center, Shenzhen University, Shenzhen, China; Department of Medicine, Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, USA; Regenstrief Institute, Indianapolis, USA; Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, USA; Department of Medical and Molecular Genetics, Indiana University, Indianapolis, USA"
9165fb372cc1495e9e87f63c2c467862,3D Printing of Inertial Microfluidic Devices,"Inertial microfluidics has been broadly investigated, resulting in the development of various applications, mainly for particle or cell separation. Lateral migrations of these particles within a microchannel strictly depend on the channel design and its crosssection. Nonetheless, the fabrication of these microchannels is a continuous challenging issue for the microfluidic community, where the most studied channel crosssections are limited to only rectangular and more recently trapezoidal microchannels. As a result, a huge amount of potential remains intact for other geometries with crosssections difficult to fabricate with standard microfabrication techniques. In this study, by leveraging on benefits of additive manufacturing, we have proposed a new method for the fabrication of inertial microfluidic devices. In our proposed workflow, parts are first printed via a highresolution DLPSLA 3D printer and then bonded to a transparent PMMA sheet using a doublecoated pressuresensitive adhesive tape. Using this method, we have fabricated and tested a plethora of existing inertial microfluidic devices, whether in a single or multiplexed manner, such as straight, spiral, serpentine, curvilinear, and contractionexpansion arrays. Our characterizations using both particles and cells revealed that the produced chips could withstand a pressure up to 150 psi with minimum interference of the tape to the total functionality of the device and viability of cells. As a showcase of the versatility of our method, we have proposed a new spiral microchannel with rightangled triangular crosssection which is technically impossible to fabricate using the standard lithography. We are of the opinion that the method proposed in this study will open the door for more complex geometries with the bespoke passive internal flow. Furthermore, the proposed fabrication workflow can be adopted at the production level, enabling largescale manufacturing of inertial microfluidic devices.",Sajad Razavi Bazaz; Omid Rouhi; Mohammad Amin Raoufi; Fatemeh Ejeian; Mohsen Asadnia; Dayong Jin; Majid Ebrahimi Warkiani,"Biomedical engineering; Fluid dynamics; Isolation, separation and purification; Labonachip; Particle physics","School of Biomedical Engineering, University of Technology Sydney, Sydney, Australia; Institute for Biomedical Materials  Devices (IBMD), Faculty of Science, University of Technology Sydney, Sydney, Australia; School of Biomedical Engineering, University of Technology Sydney, Sydney, Australia; School of Biomedical Engineering, University of Technology Sydney, Sydney, Australia; School of Engineering, Macquarie University, Sydney, Australia; School of Biomedical Engineering, University of Technology Sydney, Sydney, Australia; School of Engineering, Macquarie University, Sydney, Australia; Institute for Biomedical Materials  Devices (IBMD), Faculty of Science, University of Technology Sydney, Sydney, Australia; SUStechUTS joint Research Centre for Biomedical Materials  Devices, Southern University of Science and Technology, Shenzhen, P.R.

Recently, NPY has attracted attention as a mediator of emotional behaviour and psychosomatic diseases. However, its functions are not fully understood. We established npy genedeficient (NPYKO) zebrafish (Danio rerio) to assess the relationship between NPY and emotional behaviours. The NPYKO zebrafish exhibited similar growth, but pomc and avp mRNA levels in the brain were higher as compared to wildtype fish. NPYKO zebrafish exhibited several anxietylike behaviours, such as a decrease in social interaction in mirror test and decreased locomotion in blackwhite test. The acute cold stresstreated NPYKO zebrafish exhibited anxietylike behaviours such as remaining stationary and swimming along the side of the tank in the mirror test. Moreover, expression levels of anxietyassociated genes (orx and cck) and catecholamine production (gr, mr, th1 and th2) were significantly higher in NPYKO zebrafish than in wildtype fish. We demonstrated that NPYKO zebrafish have an anxiety phenotype and a stressvulnerability like NPYKO mice, whereby orx andor catecholamine signalling may be involved in the mechanism actions.",Kazuhiro Shiozaki; Momoko Kawabe; Kiwako Karasuyama; Takayoshi Kurachi; Akito Hayashi; Koji Ataka; Haruki Iwai; Hinako Takeno; Oki Hayasaka; Tomonari Kotani; Masaharu Komatsu; Akio Inui,Animal behaviour; Animal disease models; Peptide hormones; Zoology,"Department of Food Life Science, Faculty of Fisheries, Kagoshima University, Kagoshima, Japan; The United Graduate School of Agricultural Sciences, Kagoshima University, Kagoshima, Japan; Department of Food Life Science, Faculty of Fisheries, Kagoshima University, Kagoshima, Japan; Department of Food Life Science, Faculty of Fisheries, Kagoshima University, Kagoshima, Japan; Department of Food Life Science, Faculty of Fisheries, Kagoshima University, Kagoshima, Japan; Department of Food Life Science, Faculty of Fisheries, Kagoshima University, Kagoshima, Japan; Department of Pharmacological Sciences of Herbal Medicine, Graduate School of Medical and Dental Sciences, Kagoshima University, Kagoshima, Japan; Department of Oral Anatomy and Cell Biology, Graduate School of Medical and Dental Sciences, Kagoshima University, Kagoshima, Japan; Department of Food Life Science, Faculty of Fisheries, Kagoshima University, Kagoshima, Japan; The United Graduate School of Agricultural Sciences, Kagoshima University, Kagoshima, Japan; Department of Food Life Science, Faculty of Fisheries, Kagoshima University, Kagoshima, Japan; The United Graduate School of Agricultural Sciences, Kagoshima University, Kagoshima, Japan; Department of Food Life Science, Faculty of Fisheries, Kagoshima University, Kagoshima, Japan; The United Graduate School of Agricultural Sciences, Kagoshima University, Kagoshima, Japan; Department of Pharmacological Sciences of Herbal Medicine, Graduate School of Medical and Dental Sciences, Kagoshima University, Kagoshima, Japan"

The aim of this study was to conduct a systematic review and metaanalysis on GORD prevalence and risk factors at a global level. MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, Scopus, Cochrane library, and Google Scholar were systematically searched, without language restrictions, for studies on the prevalence and risk factors of GORD. Data were pooled using a random effects model (95% confidence interval), and the odds ratio and relative risk for each risk factor were calculated. Out of 34,355 search results, 96 records reporting the results from 102 studies fulfilled the inclusion criteria, representing 37 countries and all regions of the UN geoscheme. The global pooled prevalence of GORD was 13.98% and varied greatly according to region (12.88% in Latin America and the Caribbean to 19.55% in North America) and country (4.16% in China to 22.40% in Turkey). Using the United Nations 2017 Revision of World Population Prospects, the estimated number of individuals suffering from GORD globally is 1.03 billion. Multiple risk factors associated with a significant increase in the risk of GORD were also identified. This systematic review and metaanalysis revealed that although a substantial proportion (13.98%) of the global population suffers from GORD, there are significant variations between regions and countries.

Fiftytwo secondyear medical students were randomly assigned to three learning tools: textonly, threedimension visualisation in a twodimensional screen (3DM), or mixed reality (MR). An anatomy test lasting for twenty minutes measuring spatial and nominal knowledge was taken immediately after the learning intervention and another thirty days later. Psychometric tests were also used to measure participants' memory, reasoning and concentration abilities. Additionally, electroencephalogram data was captured to measure the participants' awakeness during the learning session. Results of this study showed that the MR group performed poorly in the nominal questions compared to the other groups; however, the MR group demonstrated higher retention in both the nominal and spatial type information for at least a month compared to the other groups. Furthermore, participants in the 3DM and MR groups reported increased engagement. The results of this study suggest that threedimensional visualiser tools are likely to enhance learning in anatomy education.

The main objective of this study was to identify, quantify and localize the effects of physicalchemical communication signals between tumor cells and the surrounding biomaterial stiffness over time, defining how aggressiveness increases in SKNBE(2) neuroblastoma (NB) cell line. Biomimetic hydrogels with SKNBE(2) cells, methacrylated gelatin and increasing concentrations of methacrylated alginate (AlgMA 0%, 1% and 2%) were used. Young's modulus was used to define the stiffness of bioprinted hydrogels and NB tumors. Stained sections of paraffinembedded hydrogels were digitally quantified. Human NB and 1% AlgMA hydrogels presented similar Young s modulus mean, and orthotopic NB mice tumors were equally similar to 0% and 1% AlgMA hydrogels. Porosity increased over time; cell cluster density decreased over time and with stiffness, and cell cluster occupancy generally increased with time and decreased with stiffness. In addition, cell proliferation, mRNA metabolism and antiapoptotic activity advanced over time and with stiffness. Together, this rheological, optical and digital data show the potential of the 3D in vitro cell model described herein to infer how intercellular space stiffness patterns drive the clinical behavior associated with NB patients.",Ezequiel Monferrer; Susana MartinVano; Aitor Carretero; Andrea GarciaLizarribar; Rebeca BurgosPanadero; Samuel Navarro; Josep Samitier; Rosa Noguera,Biomaterials  cells; Paediatric cancer,"Pathology Department, Medical School, University of ValenciaINCLIVA, Valencia, Spain; CIBERONC, Madrid, Spain; Pathology Department, Medical School, University of ValenciaINCLIVA, Valencia, Spain; CIBERONC, Madrid, Spain; Pathology Department, Medical School, University of ValenciaINCLIVA, Valencia, Spain; Institute for Bioengineering of Catalonia, Barcelona Institute of Science and Technology (IBECBIST), Barcelona, Spain; Department of Electronics and Biomedical Engineering, University of Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain; Pathology Department, Medical School, University of ValenciaINCLIVA, Valencia, Spain; CIBERONC, Madrid, Spain; Pathology Department, Medical School, University of ValenciaINCLIVA, Valencia, Spain; CIBERONC, Madrid, Spain; Institute for Bioengineering of Catalonia, Barcelona Institute of Science and Technology (IBECBIST), Barcelona, Spain; CIBERBBN, Madrid, Spain; Department of Electronics and Biomedical Engineering, University of Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain; Pathology Department, Medical School, University of ValenciaINCLIVA, Valencia, Spain; CIBERONC, Madrid, Spain"

The etiology of the disease is poorly understood resulting in a lack of effective treatment approaches. It is well known that mechanical stress plays a major role in tissue remodeling, yet its role in diverticulosis has not been studied. Here, we used computational mechanics to investigate changes in stress distribution engendered over the colon tissue by the presence of a pouchlike structure. The objectives of the study were twofold: (1) observe how stress distribution changes around a single pouch and (2) evaluate how stress elevation correlates with the size of the pouch. Results showed that high stresses are concentrated around the neck of a pouch, and their values and propagation increase with the size of the pouch neck rather than the pouch surface area. These findings suggest that stress distribution may change in diverticulosis and a vicious cycle may occur where pouch size increases due to stress elevation, which in turn elevates stress further and so on. Significant luminal pressure reduction would be necessary to maintain stress at normal level according to our results and therapeutic approaches aimed directly at reducing stress should rather be sought after.",Bhavesh Patel; Xiaomei Guo; Jillian Noblet; Sean Chambers; Hans Gregersen; Ghassan S.

The cytotoxicity of PM is mainly due to the abnormal increase of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which damage cellular components such as DNA, RNA, and proteins. The correlation between PM exposure and human disorders, including mortality, is based on longterm exposure. In this study we have investigated acute responses of mucussecreting goblet cells upon exposure to PM derived from a heavy diesel engine. To this end, we employed the mucociliary epithelium of amphibian embryos and human Calu3 cells to examine PM mucotoxicity. Our data suggest that acute exposure to PM significantly impairs mucus secretion and results in the accumulation of mucus vesicles in the cytoplasm of goblet cells. RNAseq analysis revealed that acute responses to PM exposure significantly altered gene expression patterns; however, known regulators of mucus production and the secretory pathway were not significantly altered. Interestingly, pretreatment with tocopherol nearly recovered the hyposecretion of mucus from both amphibian and human goblet cells. We believe this study demonstrates the mucotoxicity of PM and the protective function of tocopherol on mucotoxicity caused by acute PM exposure from heavy diesel engines.",HeeSun Yang; Hyo Jung Sim; Hanna Cho; Woo Young Bang; Ha Eun Kim; Taeg Kyu Kwon; Taejoon Kwon; Tae Joo Park,Biological models; Mechanisms of disease; Natural hazards,"Biological and Genetic Resources Assessment Division, National Institute of Biological Resources, Incheon, Korea; School of Life Sciences, Ulsan National Institute of Science and Technology (UNIST), Ulsan, South Korea; Biological and Genetic Resources Assessment Division, National Institute of Biological Resources, Incheon, Korea; Biological and Genetic Resources Assessment Division, National Institute of Biological Resources, Incheon, Korea; School of Life Sciences, Ulsan National Institute of Science and Technology (UNIST), Ulsan, South Korea; Department of Immunology, School of Medicine, Keimyung University, Daegu, South Korea; School of Life Sciences, Ulsan National Institute of Science and Technology (UNIST), Ulsan, South Korea; Center for Genomic Integrity, Institute for Basic Science, Ulsan, Republic of Korea; School of Life Sciences, Ulsan National Institute of Science and Technology (UNIST), Ulsan, South Korea; Center for Genomic Integrity, Institute for Basic Science, Ulsan, Republic of Korea"

The majority of compounds in the polyoxometalate kingdom are synthesized under laboratory conditions. However, Nature has its own labs with the conditions often unconceivable to the mankind. The striking example of such a unique environment is volcanic fumaroles  the natural factories of gastransport synthesis. We herein report on the discovery of a novel class of complex polyoxocuprates grown in the hot active fumaroles of the Tolbachik volcano at the Kamchatka Peninsula, Russia. The cuboctahedral nanoclusters {MCu12O8](AsO4)8} are stabilized by the core Fe(III) or Ti(IV) cations residing in the unique cubic coordination.

In present work, a structural search of the global minimum for divalent bimetal Be2Mgn (n  120) clusters are performed by utilizing CALYPSO structural searching method with subsequent DFT optimization. We investigate the evolution of geometries, electronic properties, and nature of bonding from small to mediumsized clusters. It is found that the structural transition from hollow 3D structures to filled cagelike frameworks emerges at n  10 for Be2Mgn clusters, which is obviously earlier than that of Mgn clusters. The Be atoms prefer the surface sites in small cluster size, then one Be atom tend to embed itself inside the magnesium motif. At the number of Mg larger than eighteen, two Be atoms have been completely encapsulated by caged magnesium frameworks. In all Be2Mgn clusters, the partial charge transfer from Mg to Be takes place. An increase in the occupations of the Be2p and Mg3p orbitals reveals the increasing metallic behavior of Be2Mgn clusters. The analysis of stability shows that the cluster stability can be enhanced by Be atoms doping and the Be2Mg8 cluster possesses robust stability across the cluster size range of n  120. There is sp hybridization between the Be and Mg atoms leading to stronger BeMg bonds in Be2Mg8 cluster. This finding is supported by the multicenter bonds and Mayer bond order analysis.",Feige Zhang; Hairong Zhang; Wang Xin; Peng Chen; Yanfei Hu; Xiaoyi Zhang; Yaru Zhao,Chemical physics; Electronic properties and materials,"School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Baoji University of Arts and Sciences, Baoji, China; School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Baoji University of Arts and Sciences, Baoji, China; College of Physics and Optoelectronics Technology, Baoji University of Arts and Sciences, Baoji, China; College of Physics and Optoelectronics Technology, Baoji University of Arts and Sciences, Baoji, China; School of Physics and Electronic Engineering, Sichuan University of Science  Engineering, Zigong, China; College of Physics and Optoelectronics Technology, Baoji University of Arts and Sciences, Baoji, China; College of Physics and Optoelectronics Technology, Baoji University of Arts and Sciences, Baoji, China"

We aimed to explore the association between preoperative serum fibrinogen level and risk of postoperative AKI in patients with open cardiac surgery. 3459 patients who underwent cardiac valve replacement surgery from January 2011 to September 2015 were recruited. The primary outcome was AKI, defined as AKI stage1 or higher based on the Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) Guidelines. Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) was used to subsample minority groups to eliminate classification bias. 510 (14.74%) patients developed postoperative AKI. Serum fibrinogen was independently associated with AKI (OR  1.211, 95% CI 1.080 to 1.358, p  0.001) after adjustment of covariates. The receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curve for the outcome of AKI, after the addition of serum fibrinogen, had a cstatistic increasing from 0.72 to 0.73 (p  0.001). This translated to a substantially improved AKI risk classification with a net reclassification index of 0.178 (p  0.001). After SMOTE subsampling, serum fibrinogen was still independently associated with AKI grade 1 or higher (OR  1.212, 95% CI 1.1089 to 1.347, p  0.003).

We studied 1116 newly diagnosed AML patients (age range, 1886 years) who had received induction chemotherapy. Among 771 patients not selected by genetics, the ELN2017 classification reassigned 26.5% of patients into a more favorable or, more commonly, a more adverserisk group compared with the ELN2010 recommendations. Forty percent of the cohort, and 51% of patients 60 years, were classified as adverserisk by ELN2017. In 599 patients 60 years, estimated 5year overall survival (OS) was 64% for ELN2017 favorable, 42% for intermediaterisk and 20% for adverserisk patients. Among 517 patients aged 60 years, corresponding 5year OS rates were 37, 16, and 6%. Patients with biallelic CEBPA mutations or inv(16) had particularly favorable outcomes, while patients with mutated TP53 and a complex karyotype had especially poor prognosis.

Several unique families of phosphodiesterases exist, and certain families are clinically important modulators of vasodilation. In the current work, we have summarized the body of literature that describes an emerging role for the PDE4 subfamily of phosphodiesterases in malignancy. We have systematically investigated PDE4A, PDE4B, PDE4C, and PDE4D isoforms and found evidence associating them with several cancer types including hematologic malignancies and lung cancers, among others. In this review, we compare the evidence examining the functional role of each PDE4 subtype across malignancies, looking for common signaling themes, signaling pathways, and establishing the case for PDE4 subtypes as a potential therapeutic target for cancer treatment.",Samuel Hsien Lai; Guston Zervoudakis; Jesse Chou; Mark E.

dea154b7fb104d788cd4974cd3894aad,MicroRNA200 family governs ovarian inclusion cyst formation and mode of ovarian cancer spread,"Epidemiologic and histopathologic findings and the laying hen model support the longstanding incessant ovulation hypothesis and cortical inclusion cyst involvement in sporadic ovarian cancer development. MicroRNA200 (miR200) family is highly expressed in ovarian cancer. Herewith, we show that ovarian surface epithelial (OSE) cells with ectopic miR200 expression formed stabilized cysts in threedimensional (3D) organotypic culture with Ecadherin fragment expression and steroid hormone pathway activation, whereas ovarian cancer 3D cultures with miR200 knockdown showed elevated TGF expression, mitotic spindle disorientation, increased lumenization, disruption of ROCKmediated myosin II phosphorylation, and SRC signaling, which led to histotypedependent loss of collective movement in tumor spread. Gene expression profiling revealed that epithelialmesenchymal transition and hypoxia were the top enriched gene sets regulated by miR200 in both OSE and ovarian cancer cells. The molecular changes uncovered by the in vitro studies were verified in both human and laying hen ovarian cysts and tumor specimens. As miR200 is also essential for ovulation, our results of estrogen pathway activation in miR200expressing OSE cells add another intriguing link between incessant ovulation and ovarian carcinogenesis.",PuiWah Choi; Wai Wing So; Junzheng Yang; Shubai Liu; Ka Kui Tong; Kin Ming Kwan; Jamie S.L.

e56b24e281364d38a08025972c8236ae,"Therapeutically actionable PAK4 is amplified, overexpressed, and involved in bladder cancer progression","Muscleinvasive bladder carcinomas (MIBCs) are aggressive genitourinary malignancies. Metastatic urothelial carcinoma of the bladder is generally incurable by current chemotherapy and leads to early mortality. Recent studies have identified molecular subtypes of MIBCs with different sensitivities to frontline therapy, suggesting tumor heterogeneity. We have performed multiomic profiling of the kinome in bladder cancer patients with the goal of identify therapeutic targets. Our analyses revealed amplification, overexpression, and elevated kinase activity of P21 (RAC1) activated kinase 4 (PAK4) in a subset of Bladder cancer (BLCA). Using bladder cancer cells, we confirmed the role of PAK4 in BLCA cell proliferation and invasion. Furthermore, we observed that a PAK4 inhibitor was effective in curtailing growth of BLCA cells. Transcriptomic analyses identified elevated expression of another kinase, protein tyrosine kinase 6 (PTK6), upon treatment with a PAK4 inhibitor and RNA interference of PAK4. Treatment with a combination of kinase inhibitors (vandetanib and dasatinib) showed enhanced sensitivity compared with either drug alone. Thus, PAK4 may be therapeutically actionable for a subset of MIBC patients with amplified andor overexpressed PAK4 in their tumors. Our results also indicate that combined inhibition of PAK4 and PTK6 may overcome resistance to PAK4. These observations warrant clinical investigations with selected BLCA patients.",Darshan S.

We aimed to estimate the association between calcium and magnesium intakes and incident oesophageal cancer (OC). We conducted a retrospective analysis of the NIHAARP Diet and Health Study prospective cohort. We used multivariable Cox proportional hazard modeling to estimate the association between total intakes and incident OC overall and by histology (oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) and adenocarcinoma (OAC)). Sensitivity and stratified analyses were performed. Among 536,359 included respondents, 1414 incident OCs occurred over 6.5 million personyears followup time. Increasing dietary calcium intake was associated with an adjusted 3241% lower risk of OSCC compared to the lowest quartile (ptrend 0.01). There was a positive association between increasing magnesium intake and OAC risk, but only among participants with low calcium:magnesium intake ratios (ptrend 0.04). There was a significant interaction with smoking status. Based on a retrospective analysis of the NIHAARP Diet and Health Study prospective cohort, dietary intakes of calcium and magnesium were significantly associated with risk of OSCC and, among certain participants, OAC, respectively. If validated, these findings could inform dietary modifications among atrisk individuals. Mechanistic investigations would provide additional insight.",Shailja C.

6860d2b6233a4036acbca81cc934b8ec,Discrepancy between perceived diet quality and actual diet quality among US adult cancer survivors,"Little is known about cancer survivors' selfperception of their dietary quality compared with their measured diet quality and how those perceptions may influence their actual diet. This study aimed to fill this gap using national large datasets. National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) data from 2005 to 2014 were used. The healthy eating index (HEI) based on 24h dietary recall was used to measure diet quality. Logistic regression models were fit to examine the influence of the misperception of eating healthiness on diet quality. The agreement between selfperceived and actual diet quality was low (Kappa  0.06, 95% CI: 0.02, 0.09) among cancer survivors. Overrating diet quality was associated with a 5.39 lower total HEI score (P  0.0001), 1.00 lower HEI score for empty calorie intake (P  0.0028), 0.15 lower score for vegetable intake (P  0.108), and 0.29 lower score for fruit intake; underrating one's diet quality was associated with a 7.12 higher total HEI score (P  0.0001), 2.57 higher HEI score for empty calorie intake (P  0.0001), 0.02 higher score for vegetable intake (P  0.904), and 0.84 higher score for fruit intake (P  0.001). Our multinomial regression estimates suggested that each 10year increase in age was associated with an increase in the odds of being an overrater vs. a correctrater (OR: 11.4, 95% CI: 10.01, 10.2). Hispanics were more likely than nonHispanic whites to overrate their diet quality (OR: 1.792, 95% CI: 1.062, 3.024).

We evaluated two promising E. coli methods that may have potential in atscale global water quality monitoring: a modified membrane filtration test followed by incubation on preprepared plates with dehydrated culture medium (CompactDryTM), and 10 and 100 ml presenceabsence tests using the opensource Aquatest medium (AT). We compared results to membrane filtration followed by incubation on MI agar as the standard test. We tested 315 samples in triplicate of drinking water in Bangalore, India, where E. coli counts by the standard method ranged from nondetect in 100 ml samples to TNTC (200). Results suggest high sensitivity and specificity for E. coli detection of candidate tests compared with the standard method: sensitivity and specificity of the 100 ml AT test was 97% and 96% when incubated for 24 h at standard temperature and 97% and 97% when incubated 48 h at ambient temperatures (mean: 27 C). Sensitivity and specificity of the CompactDryTM test was 99 and 97% when incubated for 24 h at standard temperature and 99 and 97% when incubated 48 h at ambient temperatures.

Despite the wellestablished importance of trifluoromethylated compounds, general methods for the trifluoromethylation of alkyl CH bonds remain elusive. Here we report the development of a dualcatalytic C(sp3)H trifluoromethylation through the merger of lightdriven, decatungstatecatalysed hydrogen atom transfer and copper catalysis. This metallaphotoredox methodology enables the direct conversion of both strong aliphatic and benzylic CH bonds into the corresponding C(sp3)CF3 products in a single step using a benchstable, commercially available trifluoromethylation reagent. The reaction requires only a single equivalent of substrate and proceeds with excellent selectivity for positions distal to unprotected amines. To demonstrate the utility of this new methodology for latestage functionalization, we have directly derivatized a broad range of approved drugs and natural products to generate valuable trifluoromethylated analogues. Preliminary mechanistic experiments reveal that a 'CuCF3' species is formed during this process and the critical C(sp3)CF3 bondforming step involves the copper catalyst.

Here, by studying the activitystability trends for the oxygen evolution reaction on conductive M1OxHy, FeM1OxHy and FeM1M2OxHy hydr(oxy)oxide clusters (M1  Ni, Co, Fe; M2  Mn, Co, Cu), we show that balancing the rates of Fe dissolution and redeposition over a MOxHy host establishes dynamically stable Fe active sites. Together with tuning the Fe content of the electrolyte, the strong interaction of Fe with the MOxHy host is the key to controlling the average number of Fe active sites present at the solidliquid interface. We suggest that the FeM adsorption energy can therefore serve as a reaction descriptor that unifies oxygen evolution reaction catalysis on 3d transitionmetal hydr(oxy)oxides in alkaline media. Thus, the introduction of dynamically stable active sites extends the design rules for creating active and stable interfaces. Understanding what underpins the activity and stability of oxygen evolution catalysts is an ongoing issue in the field of water splitting. Now, researchers show that balancing the rate of Fe dissolution and deposition over a metal hydr(oxy)oxide host yields dynamically stable Fe active sites, with the Fehost interaction key to the performance.",Dong Young Chung; Pietro P.

3776b3cd96f64ce382d4ae161dca721e,Groundstate electron transfer in allpolymer donoracceptor heterojunctions,"Doping of organic semiconductors is crucial for the operation of organic (opto)electronic and electrochemical devices. Typically, this is achieved by adding heterogeneous dopant molecules to the polymer bulk, often resulting in poor stability and performance due to dopant sublimation or aggregation. In smallmolecule donoracceptor systems, charge transfer can yield high and stable electrical conductivities, an approach not yet explored in allconjugated polymer systems. Here, we report groundstate electron transfer in allpolymer donoracceptor heterojunctions. Combining lowionizationenergy polymers with highelectronaffinity counterparts yields conducting interfaces with resistivity values five to six orders of magnitude lower than the separate singlelayer polymers. The large decrease in resistivity originates from two parallel quasitwodimensional electron and hole distributions reaching a concentration of 1013 cm2. Furthermore, we transfer the concept to threedimensional bulk heterojunctions, displaying exceptional thermal stability due to the absence of molecular dopants. Our findings hold promise for electroactive composites of potential use in, for example, thermoelectrics and wearable electronics.

2a817718cb784f01ac3ab1226ce72928,Broken timereversal symmetry in the topological superconductor UPt 3,"Topological properties of materials are of fundamental as well as practical importance1,2. Of particular interest are unconventional superconductors that break timereversal symmetry, for which the superconducting state is protected topologically and vortices can host Majorana fermions with potential use in quantum computing3,4. However, in striking contrast to the unconventional A phase of superfluid 3He where chiral symmetry was directly observed5, identification of broken timereversal symmetry of the superconducting order parameter, a key component of chiral symmetry, has presented a challenge in bulk materials. The two leading candidates for bulk chiral superconductors are UPt3 (refs. 68) and Sr2RuO4 (ref. 9), although evidence for broken timereversal symmetry comes largely from surfacesensitive measurements. A longsought demonstration of broken timereversal symmetry in bulk Sr2RuO4 is the observation of edge currents, which has so far not been successful10. The situation for UPt3 is not much better. Here, we use vortices to probe the superconducting state in ultraclean crystals of UPt3. Using smallangle neutron scattering, a strictly bulk probe, we demonstrate that the vortices possess an internal degree of freedom in one of its three superconducting phases, providing direct evidence for bulk broken timereversal symmetry in this material. Smallangle neutron scattering measurements show that the vortices of the heavyfermion compound UPt3 possess an internal degree of freedom in one of its three superconducting phases, implying the breaking of timereversal symmetry in the bulk.",K.

Although the prognosis of LN has improved substantially over the past 50 years, outcomes have plateaued in the USA in the past 20 years as immunosuppressive therapies have failed to reverse disease in more than half of treated patients. This failure might reflect disease complexity and heterogeneity, as well as social and economic barriers to healthcare access that can delay intervention until after damage has already occurred. LN progression is still poorly understood and involves multiple cell types and both immune and nonimmune mechanisms. Singlecell analysis of intrinsic renal cells and infiltrating cells from patients with LN is a new approach that will help to define the pathways of renal injury at a cellular level. Although many new immunemodulating therapies are being tested in the clinic, the development of therapies to improve regeneration of the injured kidney and to prevent fibrosis requires a better understanding of the mechanisms of LN progression. This mechanistic understanding, together with the development of clinical measures to evaluate risk and detect early disease and better access to expert healthcare providers, should improve outcomes for patients with LN. Lupus nephritis is a serious and currently irreversible complication of systemic lupus erythematosus that is a leading cause of mortality. New biomarkers and therapies are being developed to improve the monitoring and treatment of this disease.

1150cfe537cf42a0846902a22175633f,Elpistostege and the origin of the vertebrate hand,"The evolution of fishes to tetrapods (fourlimbed vertebrates) was one of the most important transformations in vertebrate evolution. Hypotheses of tetrapod origins rely heavily on the anatomy of a few tetrapodlike fish fossils from the Middle and Late Devonian period (393359 million years ago)1. These taxaknown as elpistostegaliansinclude Panderichthys2, Elpistostege3,4 and Tiktaalik1,5, none of which has yet revealed the complete skeletal anatomy of the pectoral fin. Here we report a 1.57metrelong articulated specimen of Elpistostege watsoni from the Upper Devonian period of Canada, which representsto our knowledgethe most complete elpistostegalian yet found. Highenergy computed tomography reveals that the skeleton of the pectoral fin has four proximodistal rows of radials (two of which include branched carpals) as well as two distal rows that are organized as digits and putative digits. Despite this skeletal pattern (which represents the most tetrapodlike arrangement of bones found in a pectoral fin to date), the fin retains lepidotrichia (fin rays) distal to the radials. We suggest that the vertebrate hand arose primarily from a skeletal pattern buried within the fairly typical aquatic pectoral fin of elpistostegalians. Elpistostege is potentially the sister taxon of all other tetrapods, and its appendages further blur the line between fish and land vertebrates. The pectoral fin of an Elpistostege watsoni specimen from the Upper Devonian period of Canada combines digits and fin rays, blurring the line between the appendages of fish and land vertebrates.",Richard Cloutier; Alice M.

4057cdaf890147368b446d722c887ad7,Parentaltoembryo switch of chromosome organization in early embryogenesis,"Paternal and maternal epigenomes undergo marked changes after fertilization1. Recent epigenomic studies have revealed the unusual chromatin landscapes that are present in oocytes, sperm and early preimplantation embryos, including atypical patterns of histone modifications24 and differences in chromosome organization and accessibility, both in gametes58 and after fertilization5,810. However, these studies have led to very different conclusions: the global absence of local topologicalassociated domains (TADs) in gametes and their appearance in the embryo8,9 versus the preexistence of TADs and loops in the zygote5,11. The questions of whether parental structures can be inherited in the newly formed embryo and how these structures might relate to allelespecific gene regulation remain open. Here we map genomic interactions for each parental genome (including the X chromosome), using an optimized singlecell highthroughput chromosome conformation capture (HiC) protocol12,13, during preimplantation in the mouse. We integrate chromosome organization with allelic expression states and chromatin marks, and reveal that higherorder chromatin structure after fertilization coincides with an allelespecific enrichment of methylation of histone H3 at lysine 27. These early parentalspecific domains correlate with gene repression and participate in parentally biased gene expressionincluding in recently described, transiently imprinted loci14. We also find TADs that arise in a nonparentalspecific manner during a second wave of genome assembly. These de novo domains are associated with active chromatin. Finally, we obtain insights into the relationship between TADs and gene expression by investigating structural changes to the paternal X chromosome before and during X chromosome inactivation in preimplantation female embryos15. We find that TADs are lost as genes become silenced on the paternal X chromosome but linger in regions that escape X chromosome inactivation. These findings demonstrate the complex dynamics of threedimensional genome organization and gene expression during early development. Singlecell allelic HiC analysis, combined with allelic gene expression and chromatin states, reveals parentoforiginspecific dynamics of chromosome organization and gene expression during mouse preimplantation development.",Samuel Collombet; Noemie Ranisavljevic; Takashi Nagano; Csilla Varnai; Tarak Shisode; Wing Leung; Tristan Piolot; Rafael Galupa; Maud Borensztein; Nicolas Servant; Peter Fraser; Katia Ancelin; Edith Heard,Embryogenesis; Epigenetic memory,"Institut Curie, PSL Research University, CNRS UMR3215, INSERM U934, UPMC ParisSorbonne, Paris, France; EMBL, Heidelberg, Germany; Institut Curie, PSL Research University, CNRS UMR3215, INSERM U934, UPMC ParisSorbonne, Paris, France; Department of Reproductive Medicine  Gynecology, CHU and University of Montpellier, Montpellier, France; Nuclear Dynamics Programme, The Babraham Institute, Cambridge, UK; Laboratory for Nuclear Dynamics, Institute for Protein Research, Osaka University, Suita, Japan; Nuclear Dynamics Programme, The Babraham Institute, Cambridge, UK; Centre for Computational Biology, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, UK; Department of Applied Mathematics, Florida State University, Tallahassee, USA; Nuclear Dynamics Programme, The Babraham Institute, Cambridge, UK; Laboratory for Nuclear Dynamics, Institute for Protein Research, Osaka University, Suita, Japan; Institut Curie, PSL Research University, CNRS UMR3215, INSERM U934, UPMC ParisSorbonne, Paris, France; Institut Curie, PSL Research University, CNRS UMR3215, INSERM U934, UPMC ParisSorbonne, Paris, France; EMBL, Heidelberg, Germany; Institut Curie, PSL Research University, CNRS UMR3215, INSERM U934, UPMC ParisSorbonne, Paris, France; Institut Curie, PSL Research University, INSERM U900, Mines ParisTech, Paris, France; Nuclear Dynamics Programme, The Babraham Institute, Cambridge, UK; Department of Biological Science, Florida State University, Tallahassee, USA; Institut Curie, PSL Research University, CNRS UMR3215, INSERM U934, UPMC ParisSorbonne, Paris, France; Institut Curie, PSL Research University, CNRS UMR3215, INSERM U934, UPMC ParisSorbonne, Paris, France; EMBL, Heidelberg, Germany"
f138ed366b5c4025bbc2bd7504648bf2,Reverse TCR repertoire evolution toward dominant lowaffinity clones during chronic CMV infection,"Adaptive evolution is a key feature of T cell immunity. During acute immune responses, T cells harboring highaffinity T cell antigen receptors (TCRs) are preferentially expanded, but whether affinity maturation by clonal selection continues through the course of chronic infections remains unresolved. Here we investigated the evolution of the TCR repertoire and its affinity during the course of infection with cytomegalovirus, which elicits large T cell populations in humans and mice. Using singlecell and bulk TCR sequencing and structural affinity analyses of cytomegalovirusspecific T cells, and through the generation and in vivo monitoring of defined TCR repertoires, we found that the immunodominance of highaffinity T cell clones declined during the chronic infection phase, likely due to cellular senescence. These data showed that under conditions of chronic antigen exposure, lowaffinity TCRs preferentially expanded within the TCR repertoire, with implications for immunotherapeutic strategies. Busch and colleagues use singlecell and bulk TCR sequencing and structural affinity analyses of CMVspecific T cells to show that the immunodominance of highaffinity T cell clones declines during chronic infection with CMV, likely due to cellular senescence.",Kilian Schober; Florian Voit; Simon Grassmann; Thomas R.

RAATD consolidated tracking data for multiple species of Antarctic meso and toppredators to identify Areas of Ecological Significance. These datasets and accompanying syntheses provide a greater understanding of fundamental ecosystem processes in the Southern Ocean, support modelling of predator distributions under future climate scenarios and create inputs that can be incorporated into decision making processes by management authorities. In this data paper, we present the compiled tracking data from research groups that have worked in the Antarctic since the 1990s. The data are publicly available through biodiversity.aq and the Ocean Biogeographic Information System. The archive includes tracking data from over 70 contributors across 12 national Antarctic programs, and includes data from 17 predator species, 4060 individual animals, and over 2.9 million observed locations.

In these compounds, the bond order is 7, while accommodating 8 lone pairs of ligands in forming octacoordinated complexes or ions. Here, by comparing Ba(CO)8]2 and metal clusters of BaBe8]2 analogically, we demonstrate that the Jellium model can not only be applied on metal clusters, but is also a useful tool to understand the electronic structures of M(CO)8]q (M, q  Ca, 2; Sc, 1; Ti, 0; V, 1; Cr, 2; Ba, 2). By applying the Jellium model, we find that a 20e model with the configuration |1S2|1P6|1D10|1F2| is an appropriate description of the valence bonding structures of M(CO)8 species, where each coordinative bond contains 78ths of the bonding orbitals and 18th nonbonding orbitals. Octacoordinated complexes or ions have a bond order of seven, yet they accommodate eight lonepairs of ligands.

1467c6d126bd4b9a97aa0191906da390,Posttranslational coordination of chlorophyll biosynthesis and breakdown by BCMs maintains chlorophyll homeostasis during leaf development,"Chlorophyll is indispensable for life on Earth. Dynamic control of chlorophyll level, determined by the relative rates of chlorophyll anabolism and catabolism, ensures optimal photosynthesis and plant fitness. How plants posttranslationally coordinate these two antagonistic pathways during their lifespan remains enigmatic. Here, we show that two Arabidopsis paralogs of BALANCE of CHLOROPHYLL METABOLISM (BCM) act as functionally conserved scaffold proteins to regulate the tradeoff between chlorophyll synthesis and breakdown. During early leaf development, BCM1 interacts with GENOMES UNCOUPLED 4 to stimulate Mgchelatase activity, thus optimizing chlorophyll synthesis. Meanwhile, BCM1's interaction with Mgdechelatase promotes degradation of the latter, thereby preventing chlorophyll degradation. At the onset of leaf senescence, BCM2 is upregulated relative to BCM1, and plays a conserved role in attenuating chlorophyll degradation. These results support a model in which posttranslational regulators promote chlorophyll homeostasis by adjusting the balance between chlorophyll biosynthesis and breakdown during leaf development. Plants regulate chlorophyll levels to optimise photosynthesis. Here Wang et al. describe two paralogous thylakoid proteins, BCM1 and BCM2, which stimulate chlorophyll biosynthesis and attenuate chlorophyll degradation respectively through interaction with the Mgchelatasestimulating factor GUN4 and Mgdechelatase isoform SGR1.",Peng Wang; Andreas S.

1857046bd4784bf7bb74a01ea2ac01ea,The substrate specificity switch FlhB assembles onto the export gate to regulate type three secretion,"Protein secretion through typethree secretion systems (T3SS) is critical for motility and virulence of many bacteria. Proteins are transported through an export gate containing three proteins (FliPQR in flagella, SctRST in virulence systems). A fourth essential T3SS protein (FlhBSctU) functions to ""switch"" secretion substrate specificity once the growing hookneedle reach their determined length. Here, we present the cryoelectron microscopy structure of an export gate containing the switch protein from a Vibrio flagellar system at 3.2 A resolution. The structure reveals that FlhBSctU extends the helical export gate with its four predicted transmembrane helices wrapped around FliPQRSctRST. The unusual topology of the FlhBSctU helices creates a loop wrapped around the bottom of the closed export gate. Structureinformed mutagenesis suggests that this loop is critical in gating secretion and we propose that a series of conformational changes in the T3SS trigger opening of the gate through interactions between FlhBSctU and FliPQRSctRST. Export of proteins by type three secretion systems occurs through an export gate that is localized in the periplasm. Here, the authors present the cryoEM structure of the Vibrio mimicus export gate complex with FlhB, which plays a major role in switching of the specificity of secretion substrates and propose a mechanism for export gate opening.",Lucas Kuhlen; Steven Johnson; Andreas Zeitler; Sandra Baurle; Justin C.

Its precise mechanism of action is incompletely understood, and a specific molecular target has not been identified. Here we show that Ca2daptomycin specifically interacts with undecaprenylcoupled cell envelope precursors in the presence of the anionic phospholipid phosphatidylglycerol, forming a tripartite complex. We use microbiological and biochemical assays, in combination with fluorescence and optical sectioning microscopy of intact staphylococcal cells and model membrane systems. Binding primarily occurs at the staphylococcal septum and interrupts cell wall biosynthesis. This is followed by delocalisation of components of the peptidoglycan biosynthesis machinery and massive membrane rearrangements, which may account for the pleiotropic cellular events previously reported. The identification of carrierbound cell wall precursors as specific targets explains the specificity of daptomycin for bacterial cells. Our work reconciles apparently inconsistent previous results, and supports a concise model for the mode of action of daptomycin. The mechanism of action of daptomycin, a lipopeptidic antibiotic, is unclear. Here, the authors show that Ca2daptomycin simultaneously interacts with lipidcoupled precursors of the bacterial cell envelope and with the anionic phospholipid phosphatidylglycerol, forming a tripartite complex.",Fabian Grein; Anna Muller; Katharina M.

Taking advantage of the intrinsic properties of SiAlONs, we investigate, in this paper, the possibility of using the Erdoped SiAlON (ErSiAlON) ceramic as a hightemperature sensing material via its unique nearinfrared to visible upconversion property. We first use neutron diffraction and density functional theory calculations to study the electronic structure and thermodynamic stability of ErSiAlON. It is found that the interstitial doping of Er stabilizes the SiAlON structure via chemical bonds with Oatoms with N:O ratio of 5:2 in the sevenfold coordination sites of the Er3 ion. Temperaturedependent upconversion emissions are then studied under 980 and 793 nm excitations over a temperature range of 2981373 K and the fluorescence intensity ratio (FIR) technique has been employed to investigate the temperature sensing behavior. Temperaturedependent Raman behavior is also investigated. We demonstrate that using ErSiAlON as a sensing material, the limit of temperature measurement via the FIR technique can be pushed well beyond 1200 K.",Yuwaraj K.

715d639955014bb08f4a56b1d5226226,Novel HDAC11 inhibitors suppress lung adenocarcinoma stem cell selfrenewal and overcome drug resistance by suppressing Sox2,"Nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is known to have poor patient outcomes due to development of resistance to chemotherapy agents and the EGFR inhibitors, which results in recurrence of highly aggressive lung tumors. Even with recent success in immunotherapy using the checkpoint inhibitors, additional investigations are essential to identify novel therapeutic strategies for efficacious treatment for NSCLC. Our finding that high levels of histone deacetylase 11 (HDAC11) in human lung tumor tissues correlate with poor patient outcome and that depletion or inhibition of HDAC11 not only significantly reduces selfrenewal of cancer stem cells (CSCs) from NSCLC but also decreases Sox2 expression that is essential for maintenance of CSCs, indicates that HDAC11 is a potential target to combat NSCLC. We find that HDAC11 suppresses Sox2 expression through the mediation of Gli1, the Hedgehog pathway transcription factor. In addition, we have used highly selective HDAC11 inhibitors that not only target stemness and adherence independent growth of lung cancer cells but these inhibitors could also efficiently ablate the growth of druginsensitive stemlike cells as well as therapy resistant lung cancer cells. These inhibitors were found to be efficacious even in presence of cancer associated fibroblasts which have been shown to contribute in therapy resistance.

Recent computational tools leverage domaindomain interaction data to resolve the conditionspecific interaction networks from RNASeq data accounting for the domain content of the primary transcripts expressed. Here, we used The Cancer Genome Atlas RNASeq datasets to generate 642 patientspecific pairs of interactomes corresponding to both the tumor and the healthy tissues across 13 cancer types. The comparison of these interactomes provided a list of patientspecific edgetic perturbations of the interactomes associated with the cancerous state. We found that among the identified perturbations, select sets are robustly shared between patients at the multicancer, cancerspecific and cancer subtype specific levels. Interestingly, the majority of the alterations do not directly involve significantly mutated genes, nevertheless, they strongly correlate with patient survival.

Twentyseven breast tumor patients who received neoadjuvant systemic therapy (NST) for breastconserving surgery were studied. Before and after NST, MRI scans in prone and supine positions were performed immediately. Tumor segmentation, volume, and position of tumors were evaluated in both positions. Average tumor volumes in prone and supine positions did not significantly differ (p  0.877). Tumor movement from prone to supine positions from the origin of the bottom center of the sternum was strongly correlated with the distance from the tumor center to the chest wall (r  0.669; p  0.05). Tumor changes from prone to supine positions measured from the origin of the nipple depended on the location of the tumor in the breast. The pronetosupine movement of all tumors from the origin of the bottom center of the sternum tended to move outward from the sagittal centerline of the body on the coronal plane, to the inside of the body on the sagittal plane, and outward and downward close to the body on the axial plane, which might help in planning operations using prone MRI in supineposition breast cancer surgery.",ChuanBing Wang; Sangwook Lee; Taehun Kim; Dayeong Hong; Guk Bae Kim; Ga Young Yoon; Hak Hee Kim; Namkug Kim; BeomSeok Ko,Breast cancer,"Department of Radiology, First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, China; Department of Radiology, University of Ulsan College of Medicine, Asan Medical Center, Songpagu, South Korea; Department of Radiology, University of Ulsan College of Medicine, Asan Medical Center, Songpagu, South Korea; Department of Convergence Medicine, University of Ulsan College of Medicine, Asan Medical Center, Songpagu, South Korea; Department of Radiology, University of Ulsan College of Medicine, Asan Medical Center, Songpagu, South Korea; Department of Convergence Medicine, University of Ulsan College of Medicine, Asan Medical Center, Songpagu, South Korea; Department of Radiology, University of Ulsan College of Medicine, Asan Medical Center, Songpagu, South Korea; Department of Convergence Medicine, University of Ulsan College of Medicine, Asan Medical Center, Songpagu, South Korea; ANYMEDI Inc., Songpagu, South Korea; Department of Radiology, University of Ulsan College of Medicine, Asan Medical Center, Songpagu, South Korea; Department of Radiology, University of Ulsan College of Medicine, Asan Medical Center, Songpagu, South Korea; Department of Radiology, University of Ulsan College of Medicine, Asan Medical Center, Songpagu, South Korea; Department of Convergence Medicine, University of Ulsan College of Medicine, Asan Medical Center, Songpagu, South Korea; Department of Breast Surgery, University of Ulsan College of Medicine, Asan Medical Center, Songpagu, South Korea"

Three amyloidogenic proteins, P1, WapA, and Smu_63c were previously identified. C123 and AgA are naturally occurring amyloidforming fragments of P1 and WapA, respectively. We determined that four amyloidophilic dyes, ThT, CDy11, BDoligo, and MKH4, differentiate C123, AgA, and Smu_63c amyloid from monomers, but nonspecific binding to bacterial cells in the absence of amyloid precludes their utility for identifying amyloid in biofilms. Congo redinduced birefringence is a more specific indicator of amyloid formation and differentiates biofilms formed by wildtype S. mutans from a triple P1WapASmu_63c mutant with reduced biofilm forming capabilities. Amyloid accumulation is a late event, appearing in older S. mutans biofilms after 60 hours of growth. Amyloid derived from pure preparations of all three proteins is visualized by electron microscopy as matlike structures. Typical amyloid fibers become evident following protease digestion to eliminate nonspecific aggregates and monomers. Amyloid mats, similar in appearance to those reported in S. mutans biofilm extracellular matrices, are reconstituted by coincubation of monomers and amyloid fibers. Xray fiber diffraction of amyloid mats and fibers from all three proteins demonstrate patterns reflective of a cross amyloid structure.",Ana L.

4f1242cb45c04a09b3d09017824b7f3e,SLAMMS: Mutation scanning of stemloop amplicons with TaqMan probes by quantitative DNA melting analysis,"DNA Melting Analysis (DMA) with a TaqMan probe covering the mutation ""hot spot"" is a simple, sensitive, and ""closed tube"" method of mutation detection. However, DMA requires asymmetric PCR to produce singlestranded amplicons capable of interacting with TaqMan probes. This makes quantitative analysis impossible owing to low amplification efficiency. Moreover, bistrand mutation detection necessitates two independent PCRs. The SLAMMS (StemLoop AMplicon Mutation Scanning) assay, in which symmetric PCR is performed using primers with 5'universal primer sequence (UPS), has been developed to detect KRAS mutations. Some of the resulting amplicons, sense and antisense, adopt singlestranded stemloop conformation and become unable to renature, but able to hybridize with TaqMan probes. Hybrids of stemloops and complementary TaqMan probes are suitable for melting analysis and simultaneous bistrand mutation scanning. In addition, the areas under the melting peaks are determined by the PeakFit software, a nonlinear iterative curve fitting program, to evaluate the wildtypemutant allele ratio. Thus, the SLAMMS assay permits quantification of both the number of copies of the target sequence and the percentage of mutant alleles. For mutant enrichment, the SLAMMS assay uses TaqMan probes as PCR blocking agents allowing an ~10 times higher mutation detection sensitivity than High Resolution Melting (HRM) assay.",V. N.

The aim of this study was to identify key miRNAs dysregulated in pancreatic islets during T1D progression and to develop a theranostic approach to modify their expression using an MRIbased nanodrug consisting of iron oxide nanoparticles conjugated to miRNAtargeting oligonucleotides in a mouse model of T1D. Isolated pancreatic islets were derived from NOD mice of three distinct age groups (3, 8 and 18weekold). Total RNA collected from cultured islets was purified and global miRNA profiling was performed with 3DGene global miRNA microarray mouse chips encompassing all mouse miRNAs available on the Sanger miRBase V16. Of the miRNAs that were found to be differentially expressed across three age groups, we identified one candidate (miR216a) implicated in beta cell proliferation for subsequent validation by RTPCR. Alterations in miR216a expression within pancreatic beta cells were also examined using in situ hybridization on the frozen pancreatic sections. For in vitro studies, miR216a mimicsinhibitors were conjugated to iron oxide nanoparticles and incubated with beta cell line, TC6. Cell proliferation marker Ki67 was evaluated. Expression of the phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), which is one of the direct targets of miR216a, was analyzed using western blot. For in vivo study, the miR216a mimicsinhibitors conjugated to the nanoparticles were injected into 12weekold female diabetic Balbc mice via pancreatic duct. The delivery of the nanodrug was monitored by in vivo MRI. Blood glucose of the treated mice was monitored post injection. Ex vivo histological analysis of the pancreatic sections included staining for insulin, PTEN and Ki67. miRNA microarray demonstrated that the expression of miR216a in the islets from NOD mice significantly changed during T1D progression. In vitro studies showed that treatment with a miR216a inhibitor nanodrug suppressed proliferation of beta cells and increased the expression of PTEN, a miR216a target. In contrast, introduction of a mimic nanodrug decreased PTEN expression and increased beta cell proliferation. Animals treated in vivo with a mimic nanodrug had higher insulinproducing functionality compared to controls. These observations were in line with downregulation of PTEN and increase in beta cell proliferation in that group. Our studies demonstrated that miR216a could serve as a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of diabetes. miR216atargeting theranostic nanodrugs served as exploratory tools to define functionality of this miRNA in conjunction with in vivo MR imaging.",Ping Wang; Qiong Liu; Hongwei Zhao; Jack Owen Bishop; Guoli Zhou; L.

Such mutations are not induced when genome stability is maintained; however, the mechanisms involved in genome stability maintenance remain elusive. Here, resveratrol (and related polyphenols) is shown to enhance genome stability in mouse embryonic fibroblasts, ultimately protecting the cells against the induction of mutations in the ARFp53 pathway. Replication stressassociated DNA doublestrand breaks (DSBs) that accumulated with genomic destabilisation were effectively reduced by resveratrol treatment. In addition, resveratrol transiently stabilised the expression of histone H2AX, which is involved in DSB repair. Similar effects on the maintenance of genome stability were observed for related polyphenols.

2156dee309814b34b67eaaf42d5f5b29,The coupling of Phanerozoic continental weathering and marine phosphorus cycle,"Organic matter production and decomposition primarily modulate the atmospheric O2 and CO2 levels. The long term marine primary productivity is controlled by the terrestrial input of phosphorus (P), while the marine P cycle would also affect organic matter production. In the past 540 million years, the evolution of terrestrial system, e.g. colonization of continents by vascular land plants in late Paleozoic, would certainly affect terrestrial P input into the ocean, which in turn might have impacted the marine primary productivity and organic carbon burial. However, it remains unclear how the marine P cycle would respond to the change of terrestrial system. Here we reconstruct the secular variations of terrestrial P input and biological utilization of seawater P in Phanerozoic. Our study indicates that riverine dissolved P input and marine P biological utilization (i.e. the fraction of P being buried as organophosphorus) are inversely correlated, suggesting the coupling of continental P input and marine P cycle. We propose an increase of P input would elevate surface ocean productivity, which in turn enhances marine iron redox cycle. Active Fe redox cycle favors the scavenging of seawater P through FeOOH absorption and authigenic phosphate formation in sediments, and accordingly reduces the bioavailability of seawater P. The negative feedback of marine P cycle to terrestrial P input would keep a relatively constant organic carbon burial, limiting the variations of surface Earth temperature and atmospheric O2 level.",Ruimin Wang; Xianguo Lang; Weiming Ding; Yarong Liu; Tianzheng Huang; Wenbo Tang; Bing Shen,Biogeochemistry; Ocean sciences,"Key Laboratory of Orogenic Belts and Crustal Evolution, MOE  School of Earth and Space Sciences, Peking University, Beijing, China; State Key Laboratory of Oil and Gas Reservoir Geology and Exploitation  Institute of Sedimentary Geology, Chengdu University of Technology, Chengdu, China; Key Laboratory of Orogenic Belts and Crustal Evolution, MOE  School of Earth and Space Sciences, Peking University, Beijing, China; Key Laboratory of Orogenic Belts and Crustal Evolution, MOE  School of Earth and Space Sciences, Peking University, Beijing, China; Key Laboratory of Orogenic Belts and Crustal Evolution, MOE  School of Earth and Space Sciences, Peking University, Beijing, China; School of Mathematical  Statistical Sciences, Arizona State University, Tempe, USA; Key Laboratory of Orogenic Belts and Crustal Evolution, MOE  School of Earth and Space Sciences, Peking University, Beijing, China"

We performed a comprehensive metabolic network analysis of major renal cell carcinoma (RCC) subtypes including clear cell, papillary and chromophobe by integrating transcriptomic data with the human genomescale metabolic model to understand the coordination of metabolic pathways in cancer cells. We identified metabolic alterations of each subtype with respect to tumoradjacent normal samples and compared them to understand the differences between subtypes. We found that genes of amino acid metabolism and redox homeostasis are significantly altered in RCC subtypes. Chromophobe showed metabolic divergence compared to other subtypes with upregulation of genes involved in glutamine anaplerosis and aspartate biosynthesis. A difference in transcriptional regulation involving HIF1A is observed between subtypes. We identified E2F1 and FOXM1 as other major transcriptional activators of metabolic genes in RCC. Further, the coexpression pattern of metabolic genes in each patient showed the variations in metabolism within RCC subtypes. We also found that coexpression modules of each subtype have tumor stagespecific behavior, which may have clinical implications.",Nishtha Pandey; Vinay Lanke; P. K.

We explored this issue. A total of 4221 prehypertensive adults 18 years were enrolled during 20072008 and followed up during 20132014. Participants were classified by percentage waistcircumference change at followup: 2.5, 2.5 to 2.5, 2.5 to 5.0, and 5.0%. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated with logistic regression models, with stable waistcircumference change (2.5 to 2.5%) as the reference. During the 6 years of followup, 1464 prehypertensive patients (851 women) showed progression to hypertension, with an incidence rate of 32.7% for men and 36.3% for women. As compared with stable waist circumference, a waistcircumference gain  5.0% was associated with increased hypertension risk: adjusted ORs (95% CI) were 1.08 (1.011.14) for men and 1.09 (1.041.15) for women. The risk also decreased significantly for men with 2.5% waistcircumference loss (OR  0.94, 95% CI 0.881.00). We found a linear association between percentage waistcircumference gain and risk of progression from prehypertension to hypertension for both sexes by restricted cubic splines (pnonlinearity  0.772 for men and 0.779 for women). For each 10% gain in waist circumference, the risk increased by 8% for men and 5% for women. The association remained significant for both sexes in a subgroup analysis by abdominal obesity at baseline. The longterm gain in waist circumference significantly increased the risk of progression from prehypertension to hypertension for both sexes in a rural Chinese population, regardless of abdominal obesity status at baseline.",Pei Qin; Qing Chen; Tieqiang Wang; Xiaoliang Chen; Yang Zhao; Quanman Li; Qionggui Zhou; Chunmei Guo; Dechen Liu; Gang Tian; Xiaoyan Wu; Ranran Qie; Minghui Han; Shengbing Huang; Leilei Liu; Yang Li; Dongsheng Hu; Ming Zhang,Hypertension; Risk factors,"School of Public Health, Shenzhen University Health Science Center, Shenzhen, People's Republic of China; Department of Mental Health, Bao'an Chronic Diseases Prevent and Cure Hospital, Shenzhen, People's Republic of China; Key Lab of Epidemiology, Department of Infectious Disease Control and Prevention, Shenzhen Guangming District Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Shenzhen, People's Republic of China; Key Lab of Epidemiology, Department of Infectious Disease Control and Prevention, Shenzhen Guangming District Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Shenzhen, People's Republic of China; Department of Epidemiology and Health Statistics, School of Public Health, Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, People's Republic of China; Department of Epidemiology and Health Statistics, School of Public Health, Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, People's Republic of China; School of Public Health, Shenzhen University Health Science Center, Shenzhen, People's Republic of China; Key Lab of Epidemiology, Department of Infectious Disease Control and Prevention, Shenzhen Guangming District Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Shenzhen, People's Republic of China; School of Public Health, Shenzhen University Health Science Center, Shenzhen, People's Republic of China; Department of Mental Health, Bao'an Chronic Diseases Prevent and Cure Hospital, Shenzhen, People's Republic of China; Key Lab of Epidemiology, Department of Infectious Disease Control and Prevention, Shenzhen Guangming District Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Shenzhen, People's Republic of China; Department of Epidemiology and Health Statistics, School of Public Health, Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, People's Republic of China; Department of Mental Health, Bao'an Chronic Diseases Prevent and Cure Hospital, Shenzhen, People's Republic of China; School of Public Health, Shenzhen University Health Science Center, Shenzhen, People's Republic of China; Department of Mental Health, Bao'an Chronic Diseases Prevent and Cure Hospital, Shenzhen, People's Republic of China; Department of Mental Health, Bao'an Chronic Diseases Prevent and Cure Hospital, Shenzhen, People's Republic of China; Department of Mental Health, Bao'an Chronic Diseases Prevent and Cure Hospital, Shenzhen, People's Republic of China; Department of Epidemiology and Health Statistics, School of Public Health, Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, People's Republic of China; School of Public Health, Shenzhen University Health Science Center, Shenzhen, People's Republic of China; School of Public Health, Shenzhen University Health Science Center, Shenzhen, People's Republic of China; Department of Mental Health, Bao'an Chronic Diseases Prevent and Cure Hospital, Shenzhen, People's Republic of China; Key Lab of Epidemiology, Department of Infectious Disease Control and Prevention, Shenzhen Guangming District Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Shenzhen, People's Republic of China; Department of Epidemiology and Health Statistics, School of Public Health, Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, People's Republic of China; School of Public Health, Shenzhen University Health Science Center, Shenzhen, People's Republic of China"
7e26102abdcd4d3a8f1ee98dd573c044,HBxER complexmediated LINC01352 downregulation promotes HBVrelated hepatocellular carcinoma via the miR135bAPC axis,"Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection plays an important role in hepatocarcinogenesis, especially in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) have emerged as crucial biomarkers and regulators in many cancers. Novel lncRNAs involved in the initiation and progression of HBVrelated hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) need to be investigated. Here, we report that the long noncoding RNA LINC01352 is markedly downregulated by HBVHBx (HBV X protein) in HCC cells and clinical samples. The LINC01352 expression level in HCC is an independent prognostic factor for survival. We found that HBx suppresses LINC01352 promoter activity by forming a complex with the estrogen receptor (ER). Furthermore, using a combination of in vitro and in vivo studies, we confirmed that HBx promotes HCC cell growth and metastasis by inhibiting LINC01352 expression. Further investigation revealed that the downregulation of LINC01352, which acts as an endogenous sponge, increases the expression of miR135b, leading to the reduced production of adenomatous polyposis coli (APC), consequently activating Wntcatenin signalling to facilitate tumour progression. These findings strongly suggest that the LINC01352miR135bAPC axis regulated by the HBxER complex acts as an important pathogenic factor for tumour progression, which may help provide a theoretical basis for the identification of new therapeutic targets for HBVrelated HCC.",Pinbo Huang; Qiaodong Xu; Yongcong Yan; Yingjuan Lu; Zhigang Hu; Bing Ou; Heyun Zhang; Kai Mao; Jianlong Zhang; Jie Wang; Zhiyu Xiao,Cancer genetics; Liver cancer; Tumour virus infections,"Department of Hepatobiliary Surgery, Sun Yatsen Memorial Hospital, Sun Yatsen University, Guangzhou, China; Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Malignant Tumor Epigenetics and Gene Regulation, Medical Research Center, Sun Yatsen Memorial Hospital, Sun Yatsen University, Guangzhou, China; Department of BiliaryPancreatic Minimally Invasive Surgery, The First Affiliated Hospital of Shantou University Medical College, Shantou, China; Department of Hepatobiliary Surgery, Sun Yatsen Memorial Hospital, Sun Yatsen University, Guangzhou, China; Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Malignant Tumor Epigenetics and Gene Regulation, Medical Research Center, Sun Yatsen Memorial Hospital, Sun Yatsen University, Guangzhou, China; Department of Stomatology, Sun Yatsen Memorial Hospital, Sun Yatsen University, Guangzhou, China; Department of Hepatobiliary Surgery, Sun Yatsen Memorial Hospital, Sun Yatsen University, Guangzhou, China; Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Malignant Tumor Epigenetics and Gene Regulation, Medical Research Center, Sun Yatsen Memorial Hospital, Sun Yatsen University, Guangzhou, China; Department of Ultrasonography, Sun Yatsen Memorial Hospital, Sun Yatsen University, Guangzhou, China; Department of Hepatobiliary Surgery, Sun Yatsen Memorial Hospital, Sun Yatsen University, Guangzhou, China; Department of Hepatobiliary Surgery, Sun Yatsen Memorial Hospital, Sun Yatsen University, Guangzhou, China; Department of Hepatobiliary Surgery, Sun Yatsen Memorial Hospital, Sun Yatsen University, Guangzhou, China; Department of Hepatobiliary Surgery, Sun Yatsen Memorial Hospital, Sun Yatsen University, Guangzhou, China; Department of Hepatobiliary Surgery, Sun Yatsen Memorial Hospital, Sun Yatsen University, Guangzhou, China; Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Malignant Tumor Epigenetics and Gene Regulation, Medical Research Center, Sun Yatsen Memorial Hospital, Sun Yatsen University, Guangzhou, China"
67e9bc15468d460dab89030f2b651a96,Shared genetic etiology underlying Alzheimer's disease and major depressive disorder,"Patients with lateonset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD) frequently manifest comorbid neuropsychiatric symptoms with depression and anxiety being most frequent, and individuals with major depressive disorder (MDD) have an increased prevalence of LOAD. This suggests shared etiologies and intersecting pathways between LOAD and MDD. We performed pleiotropy analyses using LOAD and MDD GWAS data sets from the International Genomics of Alzheimer's Project (IGAP) and the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium (PGC), respectively. We found a moderate enrichment for SNPs associated with LOAD across increasingly stringent levels of significance with the MDD GWAS association (LOAD|MDD), of maximum four and eightfolds, including and excluding the APOEregion, respectively. Association analysis excluding the APOEregion identified numerous SNPs corresponding to 40 genes, 9 of which are known LOADrisk loci primarily in chromosome 11 regions that contain the SPI1 gene and MS4A genes cluster, and others were novel pleiotropic riskloci for LOAD conditional with MDD. The most significant associated SNPs on chromosome 11 overlapped with eQTLs found in wholeblood and monocytes, suggesting functional roles in gene regulation. The reverse conditional association analysis (MDD|LOAD) showed a moderate level, ~sevenfold, of polygenic overlap, however, no SNP showed significant association. Pathway analyses replicated previously reported LOAD biological pathways related to immune response and regulation of endocytosis. In conclusion, we provide insights into the overlapping genetic signatures underpinning the common phenotypic manifestations and interrelationship between LOAD and MDD. This knowledge is crucial to the development of actionable targets for novel therapies to treat depression preceding dementia, in an effort to delay or ultimately prevent the onset of LOAD.",Michael W.

452526216ebf431893ca4b3227b71cf1,Neural substrates of smoking and reward cue reactivity in smokers: a metaanalysis of fMRI studies,"Smoking is partly attributed to alterations of reward processing. However, findings on the neurobiological mechanisms that underlie smokingrelated and smokingunrelated reward processing in smokers have been inconsistent. Neuroimaging experiments that used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and reported brain responses to smokingrelated cues and nonsmoking rewardrelated cues in smokers and healthy controls as coordinates in a standard anatomic reference space were identified by searching the PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science databases up to December 2018. Three metaanalyses were performed using randomeffect nonparametric statistics with Seedbased d Mapping software, with brain activity contrast from individual studies as the input. The striatum showed higher activation in response to smokingrelated cues compared with neutral cues in 816 smokers from 28 studies and lower activation in response to nonsmoking rewardrelated cues in 275 smokers compared with 271 healthy control individuals from 13 studies. The relative reactivity of the putamen to smokingrelated cues increased in 108 smokers compared with 107 healthy controls from seven studies. Metaregression showed that smokers with a greater severity of nicotine dependence exhibited less engagement of the striatum in response to both smokingrelated cues and nonsmoking rewardrelated cues. The present results reveal the disruption of reward system function in smokers and provide new insights into diverging theories of addiction. With the escalation of nicotine dependence, nicotine appears to exert dynamic effects on reward processing, based on incentive sensitization theory and reward deficiency syndrome theory.",Xiao Lin; Jiahui Deng; Le Shi; Qiandong Wang; Peng Li; Hui Li; Jiajia Liu; Jianyu Que; Suhua Chang; Yanping Bao; Jie Shi; Daniel R.

However, it remains unclear whether the immunological marker alterations are stable and how they associate with brain glial cell function. This longitudinal study aimed at investigating whether peripheral immune functions are altered in the early phases of psychotic disorders, whether the changes are associated with core symptoms, remission, brain glial cell function, and whether they persist in a oneyear followup. Two independent cohorts comprising in total of 129 firstepisode psychosis (FEP) patients and 130 controls were assessed at baseline and at the oneyear followup. Serum cytochemokines were measured using a 38plex Luminex assay. The FEP patients showed a marked increase in chemokine CCL22 levels both at baseline (p  0.0001; Cohen's d  0.70) and at the 12month followup (p  0.0007) compared to controls. The group difference remained significant (p  0.0019) after accounting for relevant covariates including BMI, smoking, and antipsychotic medication. Elevated serum CCL22 levels were significantly associated with hallucinations (  0.20) and disorganization (  0.23), and with worse verbal performance (  0.23). Brain glial cell activity was indexed with positron emission tomography and the translocator protein radiotracer 11C]PBR28 in subgroups of 15 healthy controls and 14 FEP patients with serum CCL22CCL17 measurements. The distribution volume (VT) of 11C]PBR28 was lower in patients compared to controls (p  0.026; Cohen's d  0.94) without regionally specific effects, and was inversely associated with serum CCL22 and CCL17 levels (p  0.036). Our results do not support the overactive microglia hypothesis of psychosis, but indicate altered CCR4 immune signaling in early psychosis with behavioral correlates possibly mediated through crosstalk between chemokine networks and dysfunctional or a decreased number of glial cells.",Heikki Laurikainen; Arja Vuorela; Anna Toivonen; Linnea ReinertHartwall; Kalevi Trontti; Maija Lindgren; Jaakko Keinanen; Teemu Mantyla; Janina Paju; Tuula Ilonen; ReettaLiina Armio; Maija Walta; Jouni Tuisku; Semi Helin; Paivi Marjamaki; Iiris Hovatta; Sebastian Therman; Outi Vaarala; Outi Linnaranta; Tuula Kieseppa; Raimo K.

04b285bacc18408d92f4eacf49f75af0,Characterization of the receptorbinding domain (RBD) of 2019 novel coronavirus: implication for development of RBD protein as a viral attachment inhibitor and vaccine,"The outbreak of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID19) has posed a serious threat to global public health, calling for the development of safe and effective prophylactics and therapeutics against infection of its causative agent, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARSCoV2), also known as 2019 novel coronavirus (2019nCoV). The CoV spike (S) protein plays the most important roles in viral attachment, fusion and entry, and serves as a target for development of antibodies, entry inhibitors and vaccines. Here, we identified the receptorbinding domain (RBD) in SARSCoV2 S protein and found that the RBD protein bound strongly to human and bat angiotensinconverting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors. SARSCoV2 RBD exhibited significantly higher binding affinity to ACE2 receptor than SARSCoV RBD and could block the binding and, hence, attachment of SARSCoV2 RBD and SARSCoV RBD to ACE2expressing cells, thus inhibiting their infection to host cells. SARSCoV RBDspecific antibodies could crossreact with SARSCoV2 RBD protein, and SARSCoV RBDinduced antisera could crossneutralize SARSCoV2, suggesting the potential to develop SARSCoV RBDbased vaccines for prevention of SARSCoV2 and SARSCoV infection.",Wanbo Tai; Lei He; Xiujuan Zhang; Jing Pu; Denis Voronin; Shibo Jiang; Yusen Zhou; Lanying Du,Immunotherapy; Viral infection,"Lindsley F.

It is not known whether the Galactic field permeates the halo of the Galaxy. By observing pulsars in the halo globular cluster 47 Tucanae, we have probed the Galactic magnetic field at arcsecond scales, discovering an unexpected large gradient in the component of the magnetic field parallel to the line of sight. This gradient is aligned with a direction perpendicular to the Galactic disk and could be explained by magnetic fields amplified to some 60 G within the globular cluster. Such a scenario supports the existence of a magnetized outflow that extends from the Galactic disk to the halo and interacts with 47 Tucanae.

de80f70362b347ae9fd71d0c36a7f67b,Climaticniche evolution follows similar rules in plants and animals,"Climatic niches are essential in determining where species can occur and how they will respond to climate change. However, it remains unclear if climaticniche evolution is similar in plants and animals or is intrinsically different. For example, previous authors have proposed that plants have broader environmental tolerances than animals but are more sensitive to climate change. Here, we test ten predictions about climaticniche evolution in plants and animals, using phylogenetic and climatic data for 19 plant clades and 17 vertebrate clades (2,087 species total). Surprisingly, we find that for all ten predictions, plants and animals show similar patterns. For example, in both groups, climatic niches change at similar mean rates and species have similar mean niche breadths, and niche breadths show similar relationships with latitude across groups. Our results suggest that there are general 'rules' of climaticniche evolution that span plants and animals, despite the fundamental differences in their biology. These results may help to explain why plants and animals have similar responses to climate change and why they often have shared species richness patterns, biogeographic regions, biomes and biodiversity hotspots.

A key public health priority during the emergence of a novel pathogen is estimating clinical severity, which requires properly adjusting for the case ascertainment rate and the delay between symptoms onset and death. Using public and published information, we estimate that the overall symptomatic case fatality risk (the probability of dying after developing symptoms) of COVID19 in Wuhan was 1.4% (0.92.1%), which is substantially lower than both the corresponding crude or naive confirmed case fatality risk (2,16948,557  4.5%) and the approximator1 of deathsdeaths  recoveries (2,1692,169  17,572  11%) as of 29 February 2020.

We investigated the interactions between explicit strategy and implicit motor adaptation by designing a sensorimotor learning paradigm that drives adaptive changes in some dimensions but not others. We find that strategy and implicit adaptation synergize in driven dimensions, but effectively cancel each other in undriven dimensions. Independent analysesbased on time lags, the correlational structure in the data and computational modelingdemonstrate that this cancellation occurs because implicit adaptation effectively compensates for noise in explicit strategy rather than the converse, acting to clean up the motor noise resulting from lowfidelity explicit strategy during motor learning. These results provide new insight into why implicit learning increasingly takes over from explicit strategy as skill learning proceeds. Implicit learning increases the fidelity of performance during motor learning by acting to adaptively clean up the noise resulting from a lowfidelity explicit strategy.",Yohsuke R.

This Pt SAC exhibits remarkable activity for oxidation of CO and hydrocarbons with 90% conversion at temperatures as low as ~160 oC under simulated diesel exhaust conditions while using 5 times less Ptgroup metals than a commercial oxidation catalyst. Such an excellent lowtemperature performance is sustained over hydrothermal aging and sulfation as a result of highly dispersed and isolated active single Pt ions bonded at the Ti vacancy sites with 5 or 6 oxygen ions on titania nanowire surfaces.

22d2f323f6704344ace0fafdf4d3a0cf,A riboswitch gives rise to multigenerational phenotypic heterogeneity in an auxotrophic bacterium,"Auxotrophy, the inability to produce an organic compound essential for growth, is widespread among bacteria. Auxotrophic bacteria rely on transporters to acquire these compounds from their environment. Here, we study the expression of both low and highaffinity transporters of the costly amino acid methionine in an auxotrophic lactic acid bacterium, Lactococcus lactis. We show that the highaffinity transporter (Mettransporter) is heterogeneously expressed at low methionine concentrations, resulting in two isogenic subpopulations that sequester methionine in different ways: one subpopulation primarily relies on the highaffinity transporter (high expression of the Mettransporter) and the other subpopulation primarily relies on the lowaffinity transporter (low expression of the Mettransporter). The phenotypic heterogeneity is remarkably stable, inherited for tens of generations, and apparent at the colony level. This heterogeneity results from a Tbox riboswitch in the promoter region of the met operon encoding the highaffinity Mettransporter. We hypothesize that Tbox riboswitches, which are commonly found in the Lactobacillales, may play asyet unexplored roles in the predominantly auxotrophic lifestyle of these bacteria. Auxotrophic bacteria rely on transporters to acquire essential compounds from their environment. Here, HernandezValdes et al. show that a riboswitch generates longterm, stable heterogenous expression of a highaffinity methionine transporter in auxotrophic Lactococcus lactis.",Jhonatan A.

To overcome the limitations of the typically used currentbased sensing of atomicscale exchange interactions, a forcebased detection scheme is highly advantageous. Here, we quantify the atomicscale exchange force field between a ferromagnetic tip and a cycloidal spin spiral using our developed combination of current and exchange force detection. Compared to the surprisingly weak spin polarization, the exchange force field is more sensitive to atomicscale variations in the magnetization. Firstprinciples calculations reveal that the measured atomicscale variations in the exchange force originate from different contributions of direct and indirect (Zener type) exchange mechanisms, depending on the chemical tip termination. Our work opens the perspective of quantifying different exchange mechanisms of chiral magnetic structures with atomicscale precision using 3D magnetic exchange force field measurements. Atomicscale spin order is commonly studied using spin polarized scanning tunneling microscopy. Here, the authors report on a combination of current and exchange force detection together with firstprinciples calculations demonstrating increased resolution and sensing different exchange mechanisms.",Nadine Hauptmann; Soumyajyoti Haldar; TzuChao Hung; Wouter Jolie; Mara Gutzeit; Daniel Wegner; Stefan Heinze; Alexander A.

While few inorganic NIRIIb fluorescent probes have been reported, their organic counterparts are still rarely developed, possibly due to the shortage of efficient materials with long emission wavelength. Herein, we propose a molecular design philosophy to explore pure organic NIRIIb fluorophores by manipulation of the effects of twisted intramolecular charge transfer and aggregationinduced emission at the molecular and morphological levels. An organic fluorescent dye emitting up to 1600 nm with a quantum yield of 11.5% in the NIRII region is developed. NIRIIb fluorescence imaging of blood vessels and deeplylocated intestinal tract of live mice based on organic dyes is achieved with high clarity and enhanced signaltobackground ratio. We hope this study will inspire further development on the evolution of pure organic NIRIIb dyes for bioimaging. Light has limited penetration depth in vivo which has led to increasing interest in NIRII fluorophores.

In addition to a substantial warming over much of the North Atlantic, caused by increasing greenhouse gases over the 21st century, climate projections show a surprising region of considerable future cooling at midlatitudes, referred to as the North Atlantic warming hole. A similar pattern of surface temperature trends has been observed in recent decades, but it remains unclear whether this pattern is of anthropogenic origin or a simple manifestation of internal climate variability. Here, analyzing stateoftheart climate models and observations, we show that the recent North Atlantic warming hole is of anthropogenic origin. Our analysis reveals that the anthropogenic signal has only recently emerged from the internal climate variability, and can be attributed to greenhouse gas emissions. We further show that a declining northward oceanic heat flux in recent decades, which is linked to this surface temperature pattern, is also of anthropogenic origin. Most of the North Atlantic has seen strong increase in surface temperatures in recent decades, except for one region, which has been called the North Atlantic warming hole. Here, the authors employ detection and attribution techniques to show that this temperature pattern in recent decades is being caused by anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions.",Rei Chemke; Laure Zanna; Lorenzo M.

Discordant expression of YY1 and PLZF, therefore, might define NKT cell subsets with distinct effector functions. A subset of NKT cells was identified that expressed low levels of YY1. YY1lo NKT cells were found in all tissues, had a mature phenotype and, distinct from other NKT cells, expressed almost no ThPOK or Tbet. When activated, YY1lo NKT cells produced little IL4 or IFN. YY1lo NKT cells were found to constitutively transcribe IL10 mRNA and, accordingly, produced IL10 upon primary activation. Finally, we find that tumor infiltrating NKT cells are highly enriched for the YY1lo subset.

Here, we propose a setup based on Pauli spin blockade (PSB) for the preparation of largescale W states of electrons in a double quantum dot (DQD). Within the proposed scheme, two W states of n and m electrons respectively can be fused by allowing each W state to transfer a single electron to each quantum dot. The presence or absence of PSB then determines whether the two states have fused or not, leading to the creation of a W state of n  m  2 electrons in the successful case. Contrary to previous works based on quantum dots or nitrogenvacancy centers in diamond, our proposal does not require any photon assistance. Therefore the 'complex' integration and tuning of an optical cavity is not a necessary prerequisite. We also show how to improve the success rate in our setup. Because requirements are based on currently available technology and wellknown sensing techniques, our scheme can directly contribute to the advances in quantum technologies and, in particular in solid state systems.",Sinan Bugu; Fatih Ozaydin; Thierry Ferrus; Tetsuo Kodera,Information theory and computation; Quantum dots; Quantum information,"Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Tokyo Institute of Technology, Tokyo, Japan; Institute for International Strategy, Tokyo International University, Saitama, Japan; Department of Information Technologies, Isik University, Istanbul, Turkey; Hitachi Cambridge Laboratory, Cambridge, United Kingdom; Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Tokyo Institute of Technology, Tokyo, Japan"

We explored whether or not there was a survival benefit (SB) of LT according to the quality of grafts assessed by the Donor Quality Index (DQI) and recipients' disease severity, using the Model for EndStage Liver Disease (MELD) in 8387 French patients waitlisted between 2009 and 2014. SB associated with LT was estimated using the sequential stratification method in different categories of MELD and DQI. For each transplantation, a stratum was created that matched one transplanted patient with all eligible control candidates. Strata were thereafter combined, and a stratified Cox model, adjusted for covariates, was fitted in order to estimate hazard ratios that qualified the SB according to each MELD and DQI subgroup. A significant SB was observed for all MELD and DQI subgroups, with the exception of high MELD patients transplanted with ""highrisk"" grafts. More specifically, in decompensatedcirrhosis patients, ""highrisk"" grafts did not appear to be detrimental in medium MELD patients. Interestingly, in hepatocellularcarcinoma (HCC) patients, a significant SB was found for all MELDDQI combinations. For MELD exceptions no SB was found. In terms of SB, ""lowrisk"" grafts appeared appropriate for most severe patients (MELD  30). Conversely, lowmedium MELD and HCC patients presented an SB while allocated ""highrisk"" grafts.

The disease complexity and heterogeneity underscore the need for multiplex quantification of different markers. The goal of this study was to determine the association of six previously reported CKDassociated plasma proteins B2M (Beta2microglobulin), SERPINF1 (Pigment epitheliumderived factor), AMBP (Protein AMBP), LYZ (Lysozyme C), HBB (Hemoglobin subunit beta) and IGHA1 (Immunoglobulin heavy constant alpha 1)], as measured in a multiplex format, with kidney function, and outcome.

Five proteins AMBP, B2M, LYZ, HBB and SERPINF1] were significantly associated with eGFR, with the three former also associated with unfavorable outcome.

Understanding the interaction between tinnitus and depression may thus improve either symptom cluster's prevention, diagnosis and treatment. In this study, we developed and validated a machine learning model to predict depression severity after outpatient therapy (T1) based on variables obtained before therapy (T0). 1,490 patients with chronic tinnitus (comorbid major depressive disorder: 52.2%) who completed a 7day multimodal treatment encompassing tinnitusspecific components, cognitive behavioural therapy, physiotherapy and informational counselling were included. 185 variables were extracted from selfreport questionnaires and sociodemographic data acquired at T0. We used 11 classification methods to train models that reliably separate between subclinical and clinical depression at T1 as measured by the general depression questionnaire. To ensure highly predictive and robust classifiers, we tuned algorithm hyperparameters in a 10fold crossvalidation scheme. To reduce model complexity and improve interpretability, we wrapped model training around an incremental feature selection mechanism that retained features that contributed to model prediction. We identified a LASSO model that included all 185 features to yield highest predictive performance (AUC  0.87  0.04). Through our feature selection wrapper, we identified a LASSO model with good tradeoff between predictive performance and interpretability that used only 6 features (AUC  0.85  0.05). Thus, predictive machine learning models can lead to a better understanding of depression in tinnitus patients, and contribute to the selection of suitable therapeutic strategies and concise and valid questionnaire design for patients with chronic tinnitus with or without comorbid major depressive disorder.",Uli Niemann; Petra Brueggemann; Benjamin Boecking; Birgit Mazurek; Myra Spiliopoulou,Depression; Signs and symptoms,"Faculty of Computer Science, Otto von Guericke University Magdeburg, Magdeburg, Germany; Tinnitus Center, Charite Universitaetsmedizin Berlin, Berlin, Germany; Tinnitus Center, Charite Universitaetsmedizin Berlin, Berlin, Germany; Tinnitus Center, Charite Universitaetsmedizin Berlin, Berlin, Germany; Faculty of Computer Science, Otto von Guericke University Magdeburg, Magdeburg, Germany"

Does neonatal outcome including congenital malformations in children born after ICSI with percutaneous epididymal sperm aspiration (PESA) and testicular sperm aspiration (TESA) differ from neonatal outcome in children born after ICSI with ejaculated sperm? In this study, we examined the data from our IVF center from 2006 to 2016, to compare neonatal outcomes and rates of congenital malformations in children born after ICSI with different sperm origin. The results showed the clinical pregnancy rate and implantation rate of nonejaculated sperm group were significantly higher (P  0.001) than ejaculated sperm group. There were 775 clinical pregnancies from nonejaculated sperm group and 2,486 clinical pregnancies from ejaculated sperm group. Most of the clinical pregnancy outcomes were comparable between nonejaculated sperm group and ejaculated sperm group (p  0.05): the miscarriage rate per transfer, ectopic pregnancy rate per clinical pregnancy, induced abortion rate per clinical pregnancy and fetal deaths per clinical pregnancy. However, the live delivery rate per transfer of nonejaculated sperm group was significantly higher than that of ejaculated sperm group (45.4% vs 36.7%, P  0.001). Moreover, the comparison between the epididymal sperm, testicular sperm and ejaculated sperm groups showed there were no difference in the incidence of congenital malformations of babies live birth. Among singleton gestation live births, there were more girls than boys in both nonejaculated sperm and ejaculated sperm group. In conclusion, the present study clearly showed no statistical increased risk in neonatal outcomes of newborns were found in the ICSI treatment with epididymal or testicular sperm.

e1bd6b8c107b4293b3577ac1e03b20f8,Differential regulation of alcohol consumption and reward by the transcriptional cofactor LMO4,"Repeated alcohol exposure leads to changes in gene expression that are thought to underlie the transition from moderate to excessive drinking. However, the mechanisms by which these changes are integrated into a maladaptive response that leads to alcohol dependence are not well understood. One mechanism could involve the recruitment of transcriptional coregulators that bind and modulate the activity of transcription factors. Our results indicate that the transcriptional regulator LMO4 is one such candidate regulator. Lmo4deficient mice (Lmo4gt) consumed significantly more and showed enhanced preference for alcohol in a 24 h intermittent access drinking procedure. shRNAmediated knockdown of Lmo4 in the nucleus accumbens enhanced alcohol consumption, whereas knockdown in the basolateral amygdala (BLA) decreased alcohol consumption and reduced conditioned place preference for alcohol. To ascertain the molecular mechanisms that underlie these contrasting phenotypes, we carried out unbiased transcriptome profiling of these two brain regions in wild type and Lmo4gt mice. Our results revealed that the transcriptional targets of LMO4 are vastly different between the two brain regions, which may explain the divergent phenotypes observed upon Lmo4 knockdown. Bioinformatic analyses revealed that Oprk1 and genes related to the extracellular matrix (ECM) are important transcriptional targets of LMO4 in the BLA. Chromatin immunoprecipitation revealed that LMO4 bound Oprk1 promoter elements. Consistent with these results, disruption of the ECM or infusion of norbinaltorphimine, a selective kappa opioid receptor antagonist, in the BLA reduced alcohol consumption. Hence our results indicate that an LMO4regulated transcriptional network regulates alcohol consumption in the BLA.",Rajani Maiya; Matthew B. Pomrenze; Thi Tran; Gayatri R.

We have developed a synthetic cannabinoid receptor antagonist denominated BAR1. As the function and integrity of a cell cellular structure are important keys for diabetes onset, we evaluated the effects of pharmacological administration of BAR1 on prediabetic and diabetic rodents. CD1 mice fed a hypercaloric diet or treated with streptozotocin were treated with 10 mgkg BAR1 for 2, 4 or 8 weeks. Body weight, oral glucose tolerance test, HbA1c, triglycerides and insulin in serum were measured. In isolated islets, we evaluated stimulated secretion and mRNA expression, and relative area of islets in fixed pancreases. Docking analysis of BAR1 was complemented. BAR1 treatment slowed down weight gain in prediabetic mice. Fasting glucoseinsulin relation also decreased in BAR1treated mice and glucosestimulated insulin secretion was increased in isolated islets, without effects in oral test. Diabetic mice treated with BAR1 showed a reduced glucose and a partial recovery of islet integrity. Gene expression of insulin and glucagon showed biphasic behaviour, increasing after 4 weeks of BAR1 administration; however, after 8 weeks, mRNA abundance decreased significantly. Administration of BAR1 also prevents changes in endocannabinoid element expression observed in prediabetic mice. No changes were detected in other parameters studied, including the histological structure. A preliminary insilico study suggests a close interaction with CB1 receptor. BAR1 induces improvement of islet function, isolated from both prediabetic and diabetic mice.

The outer lining of the ovary (cortex) has a key role in defining fertility in women as it harbors the ovarian reserve. It has been postulated that putative oogonial stem cells exist in the ovarian cortex and that these can be captured by DDX4 antibody isolation. Here, we report singlecell transcriptomes and cell surface antigen profiles of over 24,000 cells from high quality ovarian cortex samples from 21 patients. Our data identify transcriptional profiles of six main cell types; oocytes, granulosa cells, immune cells, endothelial cells, perivascular cells, and stromal cells. Cells captured by DDX4 antibody are perivascular cells, not oogonial stem cells.

9e300098b42740d990c028635a4c5a8c,Temporal patterns in acoustic presence and foraging activity of oceanic dolphins at seamounts in the Azores,"Several seamounts have been identified as hotspots of marine life in the Azores, acting as feeding stations for top predators, including cetaceans. Passive acoustic monitoring is an efficient tool to study temporal variations in the occurrence and behaviour of vocalizing cetacean species. We deployed bottommoored Ecological Acoustic Recorders (EARs) to investigate the temporal patterns in acoustic presence and foraging activity of oceanic dolphins at two seamounts (Condor and Gigante) in the Azores. Data were collected in MarchMay 2008 and April 2010February 2011. Dolphins were present year round and nearly every day at both seamounts. Foraging signals (buzzes and bray calls) were recorded in 87% of the days dolphin were present. There was a strong diel pattern in dolphin acoustic occurrence and behaviour, with higher detections of foraging and echolocation vocalizations during the night and of social signals during daylight hours. Acoustic data demonstrate that small dolphins consistently use Condor and Gigante seamounts to forage at night. These results suggest that these seamounts likely are important feeding areas for dolphins. This study contributes to a better understanding of the feeding ecology of oceanic dolphins and provides new insights into the role of seamount habitats for top predators.",Irma Cascao; Marc O.

In general, low back pain is associated with IVD degeneration. However, the mechanism and molecular target of low back pain have not been elucidated, and there are no data suggesting specific biomarkers of low back pain. Therefore, the research aims to identify and verify the significant gene biomarkers of low back pain. The differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were screened in the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database, and the identification and analysis of significant gene biomarkers were also performed with various bioinformatics programs. A total of 120 patients with low back pain were recruited. Before surgery, the degree of pain was measured by the numeric rating scale (NRS), which enables comparison of the pain scores from individuals. After surgery, IVD tissues were obtained, and NP cells were isolated. The NP cells were cultured in two various osmotic media, including isoosmotic media (293 mOsmkg H2O) to account for the morbid environment of NP cells in IVD degeneration disease and hyperosmotic media (450 mOsmkg H2O) to account for the normal condition of NP cells in healthy individuals. The relative mRNA expression levels of CCL5, OPRL1, CXCL13, and SST were measured by quantitative realtime PCR in the in vitro analysis of the osmotic pressure experiments. Finally, correlation analysis and a neural network module were employed to explore the linkage between significant gene biomarkers and pain. A total of 371 DEGs were identified, including 128 downregulated genes and 243 upregulated genes. Furthermore, the four genes (CCL5, OPRL1, SST, and CXCL13) were identified as significant gene biomarkers of low back pain (P  0.001) based on univariate linear regression, and CCL5 (odds ratio, 34.667; P  0.003) and OPRL1 (odds ratio, 19.875; P  0.001) were significantly related to low back pain through multivariate logistic regression. The expression of CCL5 and OPRL1 might be correlated with low back pain in patients with IVD degeneration disease caused by changes in the osmotic pressure of NP cells.",Changsong Zhao; Xuemin Quan; Jie He; Rugang Zhao; Yao Zhang; Xin Li; Sheng Sun; Rui Ma; Qiang Zhang,Biomarkers; Molecular medicine,"Department of Orthopaedics, Beijing Ditan Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing, China; Department of Orthopaedics, Beijing Ditan Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing, China; Department of Orthopaedics, Beijing Ditan Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing, China; Department of Orthopaedics, Beijing Ditan Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing, China; Department of Orthopaedics, Beijing Ditan Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing, China; Department of Orthopaedics, Beijing Ditan Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing, China; Department of Orthopaedics, Beijing Ditan Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing, China; Department of Orthopaedics, Beijing Ditan Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing, China; Department of Orthopaedics, Beijing Ditan Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing, China"

Prepared nanofibers showed a 47.4% encapsulation efficiency and 73% yield. In vitro drug release of minoxidil sulphate from nanofiber exhibited an initial burst release followed by a slower release pattern. Stability studies revealed that minoxidil nanofiber was stable if stored at room temperature and protected from light with only loss of 9.6% of its nominal concentration within 6 months.

Herein, a brand new optical storage medium, transparent glass ceramic (TGC) embedded with photostimulated LiGa5O8: Mn2 nanocrystals, capable of achieving bitbybit optical data writein and readout in a photon trappingdetrapping mode, is developed. The highly ordered nanostructure enables lightmatter interaction with high encodingdecoding resolution and low bit error rate. Importantly, going beyond traditional 2D optical storage, the high transparency of the studied bulk medium makes 3D volumetric optical data storage (ODS) possible, which brings about the merits of expanded storage capacity and improved information security. Demonstration application confirmed the erasablerewritable 3D storage of binary data and display items in TGC with intensitywavelength multiplexing. The present work highlights a great leap in photostimulated material for ODS application and hopefully stimulates the development of new multidimensional ODS media. An optical data storage (ODS) system that is costeffective to make and easily scalable could lay the foundations for data storage technologies with higher capacity and improved security. The era of big data is driving the need for data storage systems with larger capacity, better security and improved performance. However, even the latest twodimensional optical disk technologies cannot store more than one terabyte of data, leading scientists to explore alternative technologies. Now, a team of Chinese researchers, led by Yuansheng Wang from the Chinese Academy of Sciences, has developed a threedimensional ODS system that uses lightemitting nanocrystals (NCs) to store and retrieve information. Made from a transparent glass ceramic embedded with photostimulated luminescent rareearthdoped metallic NCs, the new ODS system can store 3D optical data with increased capacity and improved security compared with current technologies.",Shisheng Lin; Hang Lin; Chonggeng Ma; Yao Cheng; Sizhe Ye; Fulin Lin; Renfu Li; Ju Xu; Yuansheng Wang,Optical data storage; Optical materials and structures,"Key Laboratory of Optoelectronic Materials Chemistry and Physics, Key Laboratory of Design and Assembly of Functional Nanostructures, Fujian Institute of Research on the Structure of Matter, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Fuzhou, China; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China; Key Laboratory of Optoelectronic Materials Chemistry and Physics, Key Laboratory of Design and Assembly of Functional Nanostructures, Fujian Institute of Research on the Structure of Matter, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Fuzhou, China; CQUPTBRU Innovation Institute, Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Chongqing, China; Key Laboratory of Optoelectronic Materials Chemistry and Physics, Key Laboratory of Design and Assembly of Functional Nanostructures, Fujian Institute of Research on the Structure of Matter, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Fuzhou, China; Key Laboratory of Optoelectronic Materials Chemistry and Physics, Key Laboratory of Design and Assembly of Functional Nanostructures, Fujian Institute of Research on the Structure of Matter, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Fuzhou, China; Xiamen Institute of Rareearth Materials, Haixi Institutes, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Xiamen, China; Key Laboratory of Optoelectronic Materials Chemistry and Physics, Key Laboratory of Design and Assembly of Functional Nanostructures, Fujian Institute of Research on the Structure of Matter, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Fuzhou, China; Xiamen Institute of Rareearth Materials, Haixi Institutes, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Xiamen, China; Key Laboratory of Optoelectronic Materials Chemistry and Physics, Key Laboratory of Design and Assembly of Functional Nanostructures, Fujian Institute of Research on the Structure of Matter, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Fuzhou, China; Key Laboratory of Optoelectronic Materials Chemistry and Physics, Key Laboratory of Design and Assembly of Functional Nanostructures, Fujian Institute of Research on the Structure of Matter, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Fuzhou, China; Key Laboratory of Optoelectronic Materials Chemistry and Physics, Key Laboratory of Design and Assembly of Functional Nanostructures, Fujian Institute of Research on the Structure of Matter, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Fuzhou, China"

Currently, the development of excitonic devices, where exciton flow is controlled, is mainly focused on electricfield modulation or exciton polaritons in highQ cavities. Here, we show an alloptical strategy to manipulate the exciton flow in a binary colloidal quantum well complex through mediation of the Forster resonance energy transfer (FRET) by stimulated emission. In the spontaneous emission regime, FRET naturally occurs between a donor and an acceptor. In contrast, upon stronger excitation, the ultrafast consumption of excitons by stimulated emission effectively engineers the excitonic flow from the donors to the acceptors. Specifically, the acceptors' stimulated emission significantly accelerates the exciton flow, while the donors' stimulated emission almost stops this process. On this basis, a FRETcoupled rate equation model is derived to understand the controllable exciton flow using the density of the excited donors and the unexcited acceptors. The results will provide an effective alloptical route for realizing excitonic devices under room temperature operation. A convenient alloptical way to control exciton flow between two different colloidal quantum wells (CQWs) at room temperature has been demonstrated by scientists in Singapore. Junhong Yu and coworkers from Nanyang Technological University have shown how the combination of stimulated emission and Forster resonance energy transfer (FRET) can strongly manipulate the flow of excitons between closely spaced donor CdSe coreonly CQWs and acceptor CdSCdSeCds coreshell CQWs. A mixed solution of these CQWs in the molar ratio of 4:1 donor to acceptor was dried onto the surface of a hollow quartz capillary tube and excited by subnanosecond laser pulses. Experimental data at different excitation fluences clearly shows that stimulated emission can modulate the population of excited donors and unexcited acceptors which in turn affects the FRET process between the donors and acceptors, leading to exciton flow control.",Junhong Yu; Manoj Sharma; Ashma Sharma; Savas Delikanli; Hilmi Volkan Demir; Cuong Dang,"Lasers, LEDs and light sources; Optical physics","LUMINOUS!

Cases with a HER2chromosome enumeration probe 17 (CEP17) ratio of 2.0 but an average HER2 copy number of 4.0 signals per cell (ISH group 2) are no longer automatically classified as ISH positive. Herein, 30 cases in ISH group 2 were collected. Another 100 patients with a HER2CEP17 ratio 2.0 and 4.0 HER2 signals per cell (ISH group 5) and 100 patients with a HER2CEP17 ratio of 2.0 and an average HER2 copy number of 4.0 signals per cell (ISH group 1) were also recruited for comparison. According to the 2018 ASCOCAP guidelines, all the cases in ISH group 2 were categorized as HER2 negative. The clinicopathological characteristics of the patients in ISH group 2 were intermediate between ISH group 1 and group 5. Survival analyses revealed that there was no significant diseasefree survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) difference between patients with or without targeted therapy in ISH group 2, as well as between patients with targeted therapy in ISH group 1 and patients in ISH group 2. Patients without targeted therapy in ISH group 2 had a significantly worse OS than patients with targeted therapy in ISH group 1 and patients in ISH group 5.

As opposed to cell autonomous effects, the impact of epithelialmesenchymal plasticity (EMP) on primary and metastatic tumor microenvironments remains poorly characterized. Herein we utilize global gene expression analyses to characterize a metastatic model of EMP as compared to their nonmetastatic counterparts. Using this approach, we demonstrate that upregulation of the extracellular matrix crosslinking enzyme tissue transglutaminase2 (TG2) is part of a novel gene signature that only emerges in metastatic cells that have undergone induction and reversion of epithelialmesenchymal transition (EMT). Consistent with our model system, patient survival is diminished when primary tumors demonstrate enhanced levels of TG2 in conjunction with its substrate, fibronectin. Targeted depletion of TG2 inhibits metastasis, while overexpression of TG2 is sufficient to enhance this process. In addition to being present within cells, we demonstrate a robust increase in the amount of TG2 and crosslinked fibronectin present within extracellular vesicle (EV) fractions derived from metastatic breast cancer cells. Confocal microscopy of these EVs suggests that FN undergoes fibrillogenesis on their surface via a TG2 and Tensin1dependent process. Upon in vivo administration, the ability of tumorderived EVs to induce metastatic niche formation and enhance subsequent pulmonary tumor growth requires the presence and activity of TG2. Finally, we develop a novel 3D model of the metastatic niche to demonstrate that conditioning of pulmonary fibroblasts via pretreatment with tumorderived EVs promotes subsequent growth of breast cancer cells in a TG2dependent fashion. Overall, our studies illustrate a novel mechanism through which EMP contributes to metastatic niche development and distant metastasis via tumorderived EVs containing aberrant levels of TG2 and fibrillar FN.",Aparna Shinde; Juan Sebastian Paez; Sarah Libring; Kelsey Hopkins; Luis Solorio; Michael K.

Here, we identify a critical lncRNA TRPM2AS which is aberrantly expressed in gastric cancer (GC) tissues by screening The Cancer Genome Atlas Program(TCGA) database of GC cohort, and its upregulation is clinically associated with advanced pathologic stages and poor prognosis in GC patients. Silencing TRPM2AS inhibits the proliferation, metastasis and radioresistance of GC cell whereas ectopic expression of TRPM2AS significantly improves the progression of GC cell in multiple experiments. Mechanistically, TRPM2AS serves as a microRNA sponge or a competitive endogenous RNA (ceRNA) for tumor suppressive microRNA miR612 and consequently modulates the derepression of IGF2BP1 and FOXM1. Moreover, induced upregulation of IGF2BP1 subsequently increases the expression of cMyc and promotes GC cell progression. Meanwhile, TRPM2AS promotes the radioreistance of GC cell through enhancing the expression of FOXM1 as well. Thus, our findings support a new regulatory axis between TRPM2AS, miR612, IGF2BP1, or FOXM1 which serve as crucial effectors in GC tumorigenesis and malignant development, suggesting a promising therapeutic and diagnostic direction for GC.",Jian Xiao; Linling Lin; Dakui Luo; Liang Shi; Wangwang Chen; Hao Fan; Zengliang Li; Xiang Ma; Peidong Ni; Li Yang; Zekuan Xu,Cell growth; Cell migration; Gastric cancer,"Department of General Surgery, The First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, China; Department of General Surgery, The First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, China; Department of Colorectal Surgery, Fudan University Shanghai Cancer Center, Shanghai, China; Department of General Surgery, The First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, China; Department of General Surgery, The First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, China; Department of General Surgery, The First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, China; Department of General Surgery, The First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, China; Department of General Surgery, The First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, China; Department of General Surgery, The First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, China; Department of General Surgery, The First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, China; Department of General Surgery, Liyang People's Hospital, Liyang Branch Hospital of Jiangsu Province Hospital, Liyang, China; Department of General Surgery, The First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, China"

In the context of rewarding outcomes, we found that greater serotonin transporter binding potential in prefrontal regions was associated with habitual control, while greater serotonin transporter binding potential in the putamen was marginally associated with goaldirected control; however, the findings were no longer significant when controlling for the opposing valence (loss). In blocks with loss outcomes, we found that the opioidergic system, specifically greater 11C]carfentanil binding potential, was positively associated with goaldirected control and negatively associated with habitdirected control. Our findings illuminate the complex neurochemical basis of goaldirected and habitual behavior, implicating differential roles for prefrontal and subcortical serotonin in decisionmaking across healthy and pathological populations.",Valerie Voon; Juho Joutsa; Joonas Majuri; Kwangyeol Baek; Camilla L.

It is well known that tumour cells undergo phenotypic switching during melanoma progression, increasing melanoma plasticity and resistance to mitogenactivated protein kinase inhibitors (MAPKi). We investigated the melanoma phenotype switching using a partial reprogramming model to dedifferentiate murine melanoma cells and target melanoma therapy adaptation against MAPKi. Here, we show that partially reprogrammed cells are a less proliferative and more dedifferentiated cell population, expressing a gene signature for stemness and suppressing melanocytespecific markers. To investigate adaptation to MAPKi, cells were exposed to BRaf ProtoOncogene (BRAF) and mitogenactivated protein kinase kinase (MEK) inhibitors. Dedifferentiated cells became less sensitive to MAPKi, showed increased cell viability and decreased apoptosis. Furthermore, Ttype calcium channels expression increased in adaptive murine cells and in human adaptive melanoma cells. Treatment with the calcium channel blocker mibefradil induced cell death, differentiation and susceptibility to MAPKi in vitro and in vivo. In summary, we show that partial reprogramming of melanoma cells induces dedifferentiation and adaptation to MAPKi. Moreover, we postulated a calcium channel blocker such as mibefradil, as a potential candidate to restore sensitivity to MAPKi in adaptive melanoma cells.",Karol Granados; Laura Huser; Aniello Federico; Sachindra Sachindra; Gretchen Wolff; Thomas Hielscher; Daniel Novak; Veronica MadrigalGamboa; Qian Sun; Marlene Vierthaler; Lionel Larribere; Viktor Umansky; Jochen Utikal,Cancer therapeutic resistance; Targeted therapies,"Skin Cancer Unit, German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg and Department of Dermatology, Venereology and Allergology, University Medical Center Mannheim, RuprechtKarl University of Heidelberg, Mannheim, Germany; Department of Biochemistry, School of Medicine, University of Costa Rica (UCR), Rodrigo Facio Campus, San Pedro Montes Oca, San Jose, Costa Rica; Skin Cancer Unit, German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg and Department of Dermatology, Venereology and Allergology, University Medical Center Mannheim, RuprechtKarl University of Heidelberg, Mannheim, Germany; Skin Cancer Unit, German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg and Department of Dermatology, Venereology and Allergology, University Medical Center Mannheim, RuprechtKarl University of Heidelberg, Mannheim, Germany; Skin Cancer Unit, German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg and Department of Dermatology, Venereology and Allergology, University Medical Center Mannheim, RuprechtKarl University of Heidelberg, Mannheim, Germany; Department of Hepatology and Gastroenterology, Charite  Universitatsmedizin Berlin, Berlin, Germany; Joint HeidelbergIDC Translational Diabetes Program, Heidelberg University Hospital, Heidelberg, Germany; Division of Biostatistics, German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany; Skin Cancer Unit, German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg and Department of Dermatology, Venereology and Allergology, University Medical Center Mannheim, RuprechtKarl University of Heidelberg, Mannheim, Germany; Department of Biochemistry, School of Medicine, University of Costa Rica (UCR), Rodrigo Facio Campus, San Pedro Montes Oca, San Jose, Costa Rica; Skin Cancer Unit, German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg and Department of Dermatology, Venereology and Allergology, University Medical Center Mannheim, RuprechtKarl University of Heidelberg, Mannheim, Germany; Skin Cancer Unit, German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg and Department of Dermatology, Venereology and Allergology, University Medical Center Mannheim, RuprechtKarl University of Heidelberg, Mannheim, Germany; Skin Cancer Unit, German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg and Department of Dermatology, Venereology and Allergology, University Medical Center Mannheim, RuprechtKarl University of Heidelberg, Mannheim, Germany; Skin Cancer Unit, German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg and Department of Dermatology, Venereology and Allergology, University Medical Center Mannheim, RuprechtKarl University of Heidelberg, Mannheim, Germany; Skin Cancer Unit, German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg and Department of Dermatology, Venereology and Allergology, University Medical Center Mannheim, RuprechtKarl University of Heidelberg, Mannheim, Germany"

However, cancer cells can utilise alternative nutrients to glucose for energy such as lactate, which is often elevated in tumours together with increased acidity. We therefore hypothesised that lactic acidosis may confer resistance to Akt inhibition. The effect of the panAkt inhibitor uprosertib (GSK2141795), on HCT116 and LS174T colon cancer cells was evaluated in the presence and absence of lactic acid in vitro. Expression of downstream Akt signalling proteins was determined using a phosphokinase array and immunoblotting. Metabolism was assessed using 1H nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, stable isotope labelling and gas chromatographymass spectrometry. Lactic acidinduced resistance to uprosertib was characterised by increased cell survival and reduced apoptosis. Uprosertib treatment reduced Akt signalling and glucose uptake irrespective of lactic acid supplementation. However, incorporation of lactate carbon and enhanced respiration was maintained in the presence of uprosertib and lactic acid. Inhibiting lactate transport or oxidative phosphorylation was sufficient to potentiate apoptosis in the presence of uprosertib. Lactic acidosis confers resistance to uprosertib, which can be reversed by inhibiting lactate transport or oxidative metabolism.",Emily M. E.

Following prolonged chemotherapy, MDR protein 1 (MDR1) and CD133 increase in CRC, but the relationship between them is unclear. The relationship between MDR and CSC properties in CRC was determined via CCK8 assay, apoptosis assay, DOX uptake and retention, immunohistochemistry, immunofluorescence and flow cytometry. The correlations between their expression levels were evaluated using Spearman's rank statistical test and the MannWhitney test. Furthermore, the effect of CD133 on the repression of the AKTNFBMDR1 signalling pathway was investigated in vitro and in vivo. We found that CD133 increased with the emergence of drugresistance phenotypes, and the high expression of MDR1Pgp was consistently accompanied by positive expression of CD133 as demonstrated by the analysis of patient samples. Up or downregulation of CD133 could regulate MDR via AKTNFBMDR1 signalling in CRC. A rescue experiment showed that the AKTNFB signalling pathway is the main mechanism by which CD133 regulates MDR1Pgp expression in CRC. Taken together, our results suggest that targeting CD133 reverses drug resistance via the AKTNFBMDR1 pathway and that this pathway might serve as a potential therapeutic target to reverse MDR in CRC.",Zeting Yuan; Xin Liang; Yueping Zhan; Ziyuan Wang; Jian Xu; Yanyan Qiu; Jie Wang; Yijun Cao; VanMinh Le; HaiTrieu Ly; Jianhua Xu; Wei Li; Peihao Yin; Ke Xu,Cancer stem cells; Molecular biology,"Interventional Cancer Institute of Chinese Integrative Medicine, Putuo Hospital, Shanghai University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Shanghai, China; Shanghai Putuo Central School of Clinical Medicine, Anhui Medical University, Hefei, China; State Key Laboratory of Bioreactor Engineering  Shanghai Key Laboratory of New Drug Design, School of Pharmacy, East China University of Science and Technology, Shanghai, People's Republic of China; Central Laboratory, Putuo Hospital, Shanghai University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Shanghai, China; Department of Pathology, Shuguang Hospital, Shanghai University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Shanghai, China; Central Laboratory, Putuo Hospital, Shanghai University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Shanghai, China; Interventional Cancer Institute of Chinese Integrative Medicine, Putuo Hospital, Shanghai University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Shanghai, China; Department of General Surgery, Putuo Hospital, Shanghai University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Shanghai, China; Department of General Surgery, Putuo Hospital, Shanghai University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Shanghai, China; Research Center of Ginseng and Medicinal Materials (CGMM), National Institute of Medicinal Materials, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam; Research Center of Ginseng and Medicinal Materials (CGMM), National Institute of Medicinal Materials, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam; Interventional Cancer Institute of Chinese Integrative Medicine, Putuo Hospital, Shanghai University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Shanghai, China; Department of General Surgery, Putuo Hospital, Shanghai University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Shanghai, China; Interventional Cancer Institute of Chinese Integrative Medicine, Putuo Hospital, Shanghai University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Shanghai, China; Shanghai Putuo Central School of Clinical Medicine, Anhui Medical University, Hefei, China; Department of General Surgery, Putuo Hospital, Shanghai University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Shanghai, China; Interventional Cancer Institute of Chinese Integrative Medicine, Putuo Hospital, Shanghai University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Shanghai, China; Shanghai Putuo Central School of Clinical Medicine, Anhui Medical University, Hefei, China; Central Laboratory, Putuo Hospital, Shanghai University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Shanghai, China"
3572fb31f87d424dae3781c62840fbca,SETD2 mutation in renal clear cell carcinoma suppress autophagy via regulation of ATG12,"Inactivating mutations in the SETD2 gene, encoding for a nonredundant histone H3 methyltransferase and regulator of transcription, is a frequent molecular feature in clear cell renal cell carcinomas (ccRCC). SETD2 deficiency is associated with recurrence of ccRCC and bears low prognostic values. Targeting autophagy, a conserved catabolic process with critical functions in maintenance of cellular homeostasis and cell conservation under stress condition, is emerging as a potential therapeutic strategy to combat ccRCC. Epigeneticsbased pathways are now appreciated as key components in the regulation of autophagy. However, whether loss of function in the SETD2 histone modifying enzyme occurring in ccRCC cells may impact on their ability to undergo autophagy remained to be explored. Here, we report that SETD2 deficiency in RCC cells is associated with the aberrant accumulation of both free ATG12 and of an additional ATG12containing complex, distinct from the ATG5ATG12 complex. Rescue of SETD2 functions in the SETD2 deficiency in RCC cells, or reduction of SETD2 expression level in RCC cells wild type for this enzyme, demonstrates that SETD2 deficiency in RCC is directly involved in the acquisition of these alterations in the autophagic process. Furthermore, we revealed that deficiency in SETD2, known regulator of alternative splicing, is associated with increased expression of a short ATG12 spliced isoform at the depend of the canonical long ATG12 isoform in RCC cells. The defect in the ATG12dependent conjugation system was found to be associated with a decrease autophagic flux, in accord with the role for this ubiquitinlike protein conjugation system in autophagosome formation and expansion. Finally, we report that SETD2 and ATG12 gene expression levels are associated with favorable respective unfavorable prognosis in ccRCC patients. Collectively, our findings bring further argument for considering the SETD2 gene status of ccRCC tumors, when therapeutic interventions, such as targeting the autophagic process, are considered to combat these kidney cancers.",Patricia GonzalezRodriguez; Pinelopi EngskogVlachos; Hanzhao Zhang; AdrianaNatalia Murgoci; Ioannis Zerdes; Bertrand Joseph,Autophagy; Cancer genetics,"Institute of Environmental Medicine, Toxicology Unit, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden; Institute of Environmental Medicine, Toxicology Unit, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden; Institute of Environmental Medicine, Toxicology Unit, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden; Department of Neuroscience, Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden; Institute of Environmental Medicine, Toxicology Unit, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden; Department of OncologyPathology, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden; Institute of Environmental Medicine, Toxicology Unit, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden"

The chitin nanofiberwater dispersion thus prepared was viscous and translucent, and maintained a stable dispersion at room temperature for several months. AFM images showed that the chitin nanofibers had heterogeneous network structures with widths ranging from several nanometers to several tens of nanometers. Some kinks and twisted structures were also observed in the AFM images. Xray diffraction patterns showed that both the crystallinity index and crystal width of the original alphachitin decreased with nanofibrillation. Solidstate 13CNMR spectra showed that the chemical shifts of all carbons were unchanged before and after nanofibrillation, and that all C6OH groups had the gauchegauche conformation irrespective of the crystalline fibril surfaces and insides. The degree of Nacetylation increased from 0.83 to 0.98, which was probably due to C2NH2 groups present in the original chitin being partially removed during highpressure homogenization in water. The original chitin and chitin nanofiber were dissolved in 8% LiClDMAc, and the solutions after dilution to 1% LiClDMAc were subjected to sizeexclusion chromatography combined with multiangle laserlight scattering to determine their molar masses and molar mass distributions. The weightaverage molar mass (Mw) value of the original chitin was 271,200 (degree of polymerization DP] ~1340). The Mw value of the chitin nanofiber was 165,500 (DP 820), showing that the DP of the original chitin decreased by 40% through the nanofibrillation in water to form the chitin nanofiber. Chitin nanofibers were prepared from purified crabshell chitin particles by repeated highpressure homogenization in water. AFM images showed that the chitin nanofibers had heterogeneous network structures. Xray diffraction patterns showed that both the crystallinity index and crystal width of the original chitin decreased by nanofibrillation.

Although France occupies a particular location at the western part of Europe and at the crossroads of migration routes, few population genetic studies have been conducted so far with genomewide data. In this study, we analyzed SNPchip genetic data from 2184 individuals born in France who were enrolled in two independent population cohorts. Using FineSTRUCTURE, six different genetic clusters of individuals were found that were very consistent between the two cohorts. These clusters correspond closely to geographic, historical, and linguistic divisions of France, and contain different proportions of ancestry from Stone and Bronze Age populations. By modeling the relationship between genetics and geography using EEMS, we were able to detect gene flow barriers that are similar across the two cohorts and correspond to major rivers and mountain ranges. Estimations of effective population sizes also revealed very similar patterns in both cohorts with a rapid increase of effective population sizes over the last 150 generations similar to other European countries. A marked bottleneck is also consistently seen in the two datasets starting in the 14th century when the Black Death raged in Europe. In conclusion, by performing the first exhaustive study of the genetic structure of France, we fill a gap in genetic studies of Europe that will be useful to medical geneticists, historians, and archeologists.",Aude Saint Pierre; Joanna Giemza; Isabel Alves; Matilde Karakachoff; Marinna Gaudin; Philippe Amouyel; JeanFrancois Dartigues; Christophe Tzourio; Martial Monteil; Pilar Galan; Serge Hercberg; Iain Mathieson; Richard Redon; Emmanuelle Genin; Christian Dina,Genetics; Population genetics,"Univ Brest, Inserm, EFS, CHU Brest, UMR 1078, GGB, Brest, France; Universite de Nantes, CHU Nantes, CNRS, INSERM, l'institut du thorax, F44000, Nantes, France; Universite de Nantes, CHU Nantes, CNRS, INSERM, l'institut du thorax, F44000, Nantes, France; Universite de Nantes, CHU Nantes, CNRS, INSERM, l'institut du thorax, F44000, Nantes, France; Universite de Nantes, CHU Nantes, CNRS, INSERM, l'institut du thorax, F44000, Nantes, France; Univ.

7d6f292ba4384cafb4cb3030a3fac433,From cavity to circuit quantum electrodynamics,"Circuit quantum electrodynamics focuses on the interaction of small superconducting circuits, tailored to behave as twolevel quantum systems, with a single mode of the electromagnetic field sustained by a superconducting resonator. It is thus concerned with the investigation of phenomena that arise from the coupling between the simplest nontrivial quantum system  a spin12 or qubit  and a harmonic oscillator. As such, circuit quantum electrodynamics belongs to the more general field of cavity quantum electrodynamics, which deals with natural or artificial spins in the optical, microwave or radiofrequency domains interacting with all kind of resonators. Here we survey the lineage of the concepts and experiments that led first to the development of cavity and then circuit quantum electrodynamics. We discuss similarities and differences between these two fields and compare their present achievements. This article puts in perspective the relationship between cavity and circuit quantum electrodynamics, two related approaches for studying the fundamental quantum interaction between light and matter.",S.

53c64bd81dc243eb85e0e5cfc910eff5,Pangenomics in the human genome era,"Since the early days of the genome era, the scientific community has relied on a single 'reference' genome for each species, which is used as the basis for a wide range of genetic analyses, including studies of variation within and across species. As sequencing costs have dropped, thousands of new genomes have been sequenced, and scientists have come to realize that a single reference genome is inadequate for many purposes. By sampling a diverse set of individuals, one can begin to assemble a pangenome: a collection of all the DNA sequences that occur in a species. Here we review efforts to create pangenomes for a range of species, from bacteria to humans, and we further consider the computational methods that have been proposed in order to capture, interpret and compare pangenome data. As scientists continue to survey and catalogue the genomic variation across human populations and begin to assemble a human pangenome, these efforts will increase our power to connect variation to human diversity, disease and beyond. Although single reference genomes are valuable resources, they do not capture genetic diversity among individuals. Sherman and Salzberg discuss the concept of 'pangenomes', which are reference genomes that encompass the genetic variation within a given species. Focusing particularly on large eukaryotic pangenomes, they describe the latest progress, the varied methodological approaches and computational challenges, as well as applications in fields such as agriculture and human disease.",Rachel M.

It is currently not possible to routinely predict which specific stressors lead to declines in different populations or contexts, hindering efforts to improve bee health. Genomics has the potential to dramatically improve our ability to identify, monitor and predict the effects of stressors, as well as to mitigate their impacts through the use of markerassisted selection, RNA interference and potentially gene editing. Here we discuss the most compelling recent applications of genomics to investigate the mechanisms underpinning bee population declines and to improve the health of both wild and managed bee populations. Pollinators are critical for food security but bees, in particular, have experienced worrying population declines in recent years. This Review discusses how genomic technologies can be used to monitor and improve the health of managed and wild bee populations.",Christina M.

c75ba51ee4ac4319a681c266c3775720,Moving towards a systemsbased classification of innate immunemediated diseases,"Autoinflammation as a distinct disease category was first reported in 1999 as a group of monogenic disorders characterized by recurrent episodes of systemic and organspecific inflammation, known as periodic fever syndromes. Since this original description, the focus has shifted considerably to the inclusion of complex multifactorial conditions with an autoinflammatory basis. Furthermore, the boundaries of what are considered to be autoinflammatory disorders are constantly evolving and currently encompass elements of immunodeficiency and autoimmunity. Notable developments in the intervening 20 years include substantial progress in understanding how the different inflammasomes are activated, how infection is sensed by the innate immune system and how intracellular signalling systems are consequently activated and integrated with many different cellular functions in the autoinflammatory process. With these developments, the field of autoinflammation is moving from a genecentric view of innate immunemediated disease towards a systemsbased concept, which describes how various convergent pathways, including pyrin and the actin cytoskeleton, protein misfolding and cellular stress, NFB dysregulation and interferon activation, contribute to the autoinflammatory process. The development and adoption of a systemsbased concept of systemic autoinflammatory diseases is anticipated to have implications for the development of treatments that target specific components of the innate immune system. The concept of autoinflammation has evolved to include multifactorial conditions and disorders with autoimmune and immunodeficiency components. An appreciation of the contributions of various molecular mechanisms and systems could improve our understanding and treatment of the systemic autoinflammatory diseases.

613300310d1841518b45a424d10d2cfd,Functional dissection of the retrograde Shiga toxin trafficking inhibitor Retro2,"The retrograde transport inhibitor Retro2 has a protective effect on cells and in mice against Shigalike toxins and ricin. Retro2 causes toxin accumulation in early endosomes and relocalization of the Golgi SNARE protein syntaxin5 to the endoplasmic reticulum. The molecular mechanisms by which this is achieved remain unknown. Here, we show that Retro2 targets the endoplasmic reticulum exit site component Sec16A, affecting anterograde transport of syntaxin5 from the endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi. The formation of canonical SNARE complexes involving syntaxin5 is not affected in Retro2treated cells. By contrast, the interaction of syntaxin5 with a newly discovered binding partner, the retrograde trafficking chaperone GPP130, is abolished, and we show that GPP130 must indeed bind to syntaxin5 to drive Shiga toxin transport from the endosomes to the Golgi. We therefore identify Sec16A as a druggable target and provide evidence for a nonSNARE function for syntaxin5 in interaction with GPP130. The ER exit site component Sec16A was identified as the target of Retro2, a smallmolecule inhibitor of protein toxins and pathogens.

aa6e4fa13abd4386bf9c9917d361c7f8,Safety and feasibility of antiCD19 CAR T cells with fully human binding domains in patients with Bcell lymphoma,"AntiCD19 chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)expressing T cells are an effective treatment for Bcell lymphoma, but often cause neurologic toxicity. We treated 20 patients with Bcell lymphoma on a phase I, firstinhuman clinical trial of T cells expressing the new antiCD19 CAR Hu19CD828Z (NCT02659943). The primary objective was to assess safety and feasibility of Hu19CD828Z Tcell therapy. Secondary objectives included assessments of blood levels of CAR T cells, antilymphoma activity, second infusions and immunogenicity. All objectives were met. Fiftyfive percent of patients who received Hu19CD828Z T cells obtained complete remission. Hu19CD828Z T cells had clinical antilymphoma activity similar to that of T cells expressing FMC6328Z, an antiCD19 CAR tested previously by our group, which contains murine binding domains and is used in axicabtagene ciloleucel. However, severe neurologic toxicity occurred in only 5% of patients who received Hu19CD828Z T cells, whereas 50% of patients who received FMC6328Z T cells experienced this degree of toxicity (P  0.0017). T cells expressing Hu19CD828Z released lower levels of cytokines than T cells expressing FMC6328Z. Lower levels of cytokines were detected in blood from patients who received Hu19CD828Z T cells than in blood from those who received FMC6328Z T cells, which could explain the lower level of neurologic toxicity associated with Hu19CD828Z. Levels of cytokines released by CARexpressing T cells particularly depended on the hinge and transmembrane domains included in the CAR design. In a firstinhuman, phase I trial in patients with Bcell lymphoma, CD19 CAR T cells with fully human binding domains exhibit lower neurologic toxicity, but similar clinical activity, to previously tested CD19 CAR T cells with murine binding domains.",Jennifer N.

7a9b8dadd40d42c98912405aad018ecc,"A controlled human Schistosoma mansoni infection model to advance novel drugs, vaccines and diagnostics","Schistosomiasis treatment relies on the use of a single drug, praziquantel, which is insufficient to control transmission in highly endemic areas1. Novel medicines and vaccines are urgently needed2,3. An experimental human model for schistosomiasis could accelerate the development of these products. We performed a doseescalating clinical safety trial in 17 volunteers with male Schistosoma mansoni cercariae, which do not produce eggs (clinicaltrials.gov NCT02755324), at the Leiden University Medical Center, the Netherlands. The primary endpoints were adverse events and infectivity. We found a doserelated increase in adverse events related to acute schistosomiasis syndrome, which occurred in 9 of 17 volunteers. Overall, 5 volunteers (all 3 of the high dose group and 2 of 11 of the medium dose group) reported severe adverse events. Wormderived circulating anodic antigen, the biomarker of the primary infection endpoint, peaked in 82% of volunteers at 310 weeks following exposure. All volunteers showed IgM and IgG1 seroconversion and wormspecific cytokine production by CD4 T cells. All volunteers were cured with praziquantel provided at 12 weeks after exposure. Infection with 20 Schistosoma mansoni cercariae led to severe adverse events in 18% of volunteers and high infection rates. This infection model paves the way for fasttrack product development for treatment and prevention of schistosomiasis. A new human challenge model of schistosomiasis, which affects more than 290 million people globally, will aid development of novel therapies and vaccines for this neglected tropical disease.",Marijke C.

859a8ad645734989b93613e28dafb068,Longrange singlemolecule mapping of chromatin accessibility in eukaryotes,"Mapping open chromatin regions has emerged as a widely used tool for identifying active regulatory elements in eukaryotes. However, existing approaches, limited by reliance on DNA fragmentation and shortread sequencing, cannot provide information about largescale chromatin states or reveal coordination between the states of distal regulatory elements. We have developed a method for profiling the accessibility of individual chromatin fibers, a singlemolecule longread accessible chromatin mapping sequencing assay (SMACseq), enabling the simultaneous, highresolution, singlemolecule assessment of chromatin states at multikilobase length scales. Our strategy is based on combining the preferential methylation of open chromatin regions by DNA methyltransferases with low sequence specificity, in this case EcoGII, an N6methyladenosine (m6A) methyltransferase, and the ability of nanopore sequencing to directly read DNA modifications. We demonstrate that aggregate SMACseq signals match bulklevel accessibility measurements, observe singlemolecule nucleosome and transcription factor protection footprints, and quantify the correlation between chromatin states of distal genomic elements. SMACseq combines longread sequencing with open chromatin methylation by DNA methyltransferases to enable mapping of nucleosome position and chromatin accessibility.",Zohar Shipony; Georgi K.

Here, we describe transcriptomewide proximity RNAseq datasets obtained from human neuroblastoma SHSY5Y cell nuclei. To aid future users of this method, we also describe and release our analysis pipeline, CloseCall, which maps cDNA to a custom transcript annotation and allocates cDNAlinked barcodes to barcode groups. CloseCall then performs Monte Carlo simulations on the data to identify pairs of transcripts, which are cobarcoded more frequently than expected by chance. Furthermore, derived cobarcoding frequencies for individual transcripts, dubbed valency, serve as proxies for RNA density or connectivity for that given transcript. We outline how this pipeline was applied to these sequencing datasets and openly share the processed data outputs and access to a virtual machine that runs CloseCall. The resulting data specify the spatial organization of RNAs and builds hypotheses for potential regulatory relationships between RNAs.

1c0f613bcf7548dba08226d466f91363,A multiomics dataset of heatshock response in the yeast RNA binding protein Mip6,"Gene expression is a biological process regulated at different molecular levels, including chromatin accessibility, transcription, and RNA maturation and transport. In addition, these regulatory mechanisms have strong links with cellular metabolism. Here we present a multiomics dataset that captures different aspects of this multilayered process in yeast. We obtained RNAseq, metabolomics, and H4K12ac ChIPseq data for wildtype and mip6 strains during a heatshock time course. Mip6 is an RNAbinding protein that contributes to RNA export during environmental stress and is informative of the contribution of posttranscriptional regulation to control cellular adaptations to environmental changes. The experiment was performed in quadruplicate, and the different omics measurements were obtained from the same biological samples, which facilitates the integration and analysis of data using covariancebased methods. We validate our dataset by showing that ChIPseq, RNAseq and metabolomics signals recapitulate existing knowledge about the response of ribosomal genes and the contribution of trehalose metabolism to heat stress. Raw data, processed data and preprocessing scripts are made available.

e6914901a56a49208e7443e5b2062b28,Draft genomes of female and male turbot Scophthalmus maximus,"Turbot (Scophthalmus maximus) is a commercially important flatfish species in aquaculture. It has a drastic sexual dimorphism, with females growing faster than males. In the present study, we sequenced and de novo assembled female and male turbot genomes. The assembled female genome was 568 Mb (scaffold N50, 6.2 Mb, BUSCO 97.4%), and the male genome was 584 Mb (scaffold N50, 5.9 Mb, BUSCO 96.6%). Using two genetic maps, we anchored female scaffolds representing 535 Mb onto 22 chromosomes. Annotation of the female anchored genome identified 87.8 Mb transposon elements and 20,134 genes. We identified 17,936 gene families, of which 369 gene families were flatfish specific. Phylogenetic analysis showed that the turbot, Japanese flounder and Chinese tongue sole form a clade that diverged from other teleosts approximately 78 Mya. This report of female and male turbot draft genomes and annotated genes provides a new resource for identifying sex determination genes, elucidating the evolution of adaptive traits in flatfish and developing genetic techniques to increase the sustainability of turbot aquaculture.

The challenge is to ""push"" content at algorithmically chosen moments without making users trigger it with effortful input. We trained a randomForest algorithm to predict heroin craving, cocaine craving, or stress (reported via smartphone app 3xday) 90 min into the future, using 16 weeks of field data from 189 outpatients being treated for opioiduse disorder. We used only one form of continuous input (along with personlevel demographic data), collected passively: an indicator of environmental exposures along the past 5 h of movement, as assessed by GPS. Our models achieved excellent overall accuracyas high as 0.93 by the end of 16 weeks of tailoringbut this was driven mostly by correct predictions of absence. For predictions of presence, ""believability"" (positive predictive value, PPV) usually peaked in the high 0.70s toward the end of the 16 weeks. When the prediction target was more rare, PPV was lower. Our findings complement those of other investigators who use machine learning with more broadly based ""digital phenotyping"" inputs to predict or detect mental and behavioral events. When target events are comparatively subtle, like stress or drug craving, accurate detection or prediction probably needs effortful input from users, not passive monitoring alone. We discuss ways in which accuracy is difficult to achieve or even assess, and warn that high overall accuracy (including high specificity) can mask the abundance of false alarms that low PPV reveals.",David H.

The electronic health record (EHR) at a hospital or clinic currently functions as a silo, and although EHRs contain rich and abundant information that could be used to understand, improve, and learn from care as part learning health system access to these data is difficult, and the technical, legal, ethical, and social barriers are significant. If we create a microservice ecosystem where data can be accessed through APIs, these challenges become easier to overcome: a servicedriven design decouples data from clients. This decoupling provides flexibility: different users can write in their preferred language and use different clients depending on their needs. APIs can be written for iOS apps, web apps, or an R library, and this flexibility highlights the potential ecosystembuilding power of APIs. In this article, we use two case studies to illustrate what it means to participate in and contribute to interconnected ecosystems that powers APIs in a healthcare systems.",Stephen K Woody; David Burdick; Hilmar Lapp; Erich S.

One function of regulated intramembrane proteolysis (RIP) is the release of signaling factors from transmembrane proteins. To study the role of transmembrane domains (TMDs) in modulating structure and activity of released signaling factors, we purified heterologously expressed human transmembrane proteins and their proteolytic processing products from Escherichia coli. Here we show that CD74 and TNF are heme binding proteins. Heme coordination depends on both a cysteine residue proximal to the membrane and on the oligomerization of the TMD. Furthermore, we show that the various processing products have different modes of heme coordination. We suggest that RIP changes the mode of heme binding of these proteins and generates heme binding peptides with yet unexplored functions. The identification of a RIP modulated cofactor binding of transmembrane signaling proteins sheds new light on the regulation of cell signaling pathways. Kupke et al. study regulated intramembrane proteolysis (RIP) using recombinant transmembrane proteins CD74 and TNF and find they are heme binding proteins that change their mode of heme binding after proteolytic processing. These data suggest that RIP of type II transmembrane proteins can generate intracellular heme sensor peptides.",Thomas Kupke; Johann P.

We applied cancer personalized profiling by deep sequencing (CAPPSeq) ctDNA analysis to 218 samples from 65 patients receiving chemoradiation therapy for locally advanced nonsmallcell lung cancer, including 28 patients receiving consolidation immune checkpoint inhibition (ICI). Patients with undetectable ctDNA after chemoradiation therapy had excellent outcomes whether or not they received consolidation ICI. Among such patients, one died from consolidation ICIrelated pneumonitis, highlighting the potential utility of only treating patients with MRD. In contrast, patients with MRD after chemoradiation therapy who received consolidation ICI had significantly better outcomes than patients who did not receive consolidation ICI. Furthermore, the ctDNA response pattern early during consolidation ICI identified patients responding to consolidation therapy. Our results suggest that consolidation ICI improves outcomes for nonsmallcell lung cancer patients with MRD and that ctDNA analysis may facilitate personalization of consolidation therapy.

To define the underlining regulatory dynamics, we analyze highresolution time courses of ibrutinib treatment in patients with CLL, combining immunephenotyping, singlecell transcriptome profiling, and chromatin mapping. We identify a consistent regulatory program starting with a sharp decrease of NFB binding in CLL cells, which is followed by reduced activity of lineagedefining transcription factors, erosion of CLL cell identity, and acquisition of a quiescencelike gene signature. We observe patienttopatient variation in the speed of execution of this program, which we exploit to predict patientspecific dynamics in the response to ibrutinib based on the pretreatment patient samples. In aggregate, our study describes timedependent cellular, molecular, and regulatory effects for therapeutic inhibition of B cell receptor signaling in CLL, and it establishes a broadly applicable method for epigenometranscriptomebased treatment monitoring.

The intermediary steps of this process are unclear, in particular the identity of endothelial cells that give rise to HSPCs is unknown. Using singlecell transcriptome analysis and antibody screening, we identify CD44 as a marker of EHT enabling us to isolate robustly the different stages of EHT in the aortagonadmesonephros (AGM) region. This allows us to provide a detailed phenotypical and transcriptional profile of CD44positive arterial endothelial cells from which HSPCs emerge. They are characterized with high expression of genes related to Notch signalling, TGFbetaBMP antagonists, a downregulation of genes related to glycolysis and the TCA cycle, and a lower rate of cell cycle. Moreover, we demonstrate that by inhibiting the interaction between CD44 and its ligand hyaluronan, we can block EHT, identifying an additional regulator of HSPC development. The endothelial to haematopoietic transition (EHT) is the process where haemogenic endothelium differentiates into haematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs).

To understand the molecular details of this allostery, here, we introduce Env mutations aimed to prevent CD4induced rearrangements in the HIV1 BG505 Env trimer. Binding analysis and singlemolecule Forster Resonance Energy Transfer confirm that these mutations prevent CD4induced transitions of the HIV1 Env. Structural analysis by singleparticle cryoelectron microscopy performed on the BG505 SOSIP mutant Env proteins shows rearrangements in the gp120 topological layer contacts with gp41. Displacement of a conserved tryptophan (W571) from its typical pocket in these Env mutants renders the Env insensitive to CD4 binding. These results reveal the critical function of W571 as a conformational switch in Env allostery and receptormediated viral entry and provide insights on Env conformation that are relevant for vaccine design. Here, using cryoEM and smFRET, Henderson et al. show how tryptophan 571 in the HIV1 Env acts as a conformational switch during receptormediated viral entry and design HIV1 Env proteins that cannot undergo conformational changes.

Improving earthquake and tsunami risk assessment requires understanding the material and structural conditions that favor earthquake propagation to the trench. We use new biomarker thermal maturity indicators to identify seismic faults in drill core recovered from the Japan Trench subduction zone, which hosted 50 m of shallow slip during the Mw9.1 2011 TohokuOki earthquake. Our results show that multiple faults have hosted earthquakes with displacement  10 m, and each could have hosted many great earthquakes, illustrating an extensive history of great earthquake seismicity that caused large shallow slip. We find that lithologic contrasts in frictional properties do not necessarily determine the likelihood of large shallow slip or seismic hazard. In this study, the authors investigate thermal alteration of organic biomarkers to detect paleo earthquakes in the Japan Trench. The study shows that large earthquakes like the 2011 TohokuOki earthquake can slip through different types of sediment rather than being restricted to the weakest layers.",Hannah S.

However, the low driving force potentially slows down charge generation, leading to a tradeoff between voltage and current. Here, we disentangle the intrinsic chargetransfer rates from morphologydependent exciton diffusion for a series of polymer:NFA systems. Moreover, we establish the influence of the interfacial energetics on the electron and hole transfer rates separately. We demonstrate that chargetransfer timescales remain at a few hundred femtoseconds even at nearzero driving force, which is consistent with the rates predicted by Marcus theory in the normal region, at moderate electronic coupling and at low reorganization energy. Thus, in the design of highly efficient devices, the energy offset at the donor:acceptor interface can be minimized without jeopardizing the chargetransfer rate and without concerns about a currentvoltage tradeoff. It has been commonly believed that the driving force at the donoracceptor heterojunction is vital to efficient charge separation in organic solar cells.

81042ee18d964f56a5674636bd3ca5b0,FOXM1 regulates leukemia stem cell quiescence and survival in MLLrearranged AML,"FOXM1, a known transcription factor, promotes cell proliferation in a variety of cancer cells. Here we show that Foxm1 is required for survival, quiescence and selfrenewal of MLLAF9 (MA9)transformed leukemia stem cells (LSCs) in vivo. Mechanistically, Foxm1 upregulation activates the Wntcatenin signaling pathways by directly binding to catenin and stabilizing catenin protein through inhibiting its degradation, thereby preserving LSC quiescence, and promoting LSC selfrenewal in MLLrearranged AML. More importantly, inhibition of FOXM1 markedly suppresses leukemogenic potential and induces apoptosis of primary LSCs from MLLrearranged AML patients in vitro and in vivo in xenograft mice. Thus, our study shows a critical role and mechanisms of Foxm1 in MA9LSCs, and indicates that FOXM1 is a potential therapeutic target for selectively eliminating LSCs in MLLrearranged AML.

Yet biological networks, that commonly define such modules are incomplete and biased toward some wellstudied disease genes. Here we ask whether diseaserelevant modules of genes can be discovered without prior knowledge of a biological network, instead training a deep autoencoder from large transcriptional data. We hypothesize that modules could be discovered within the autoencoder representations. We find a statistically significant enrichment of genomewide association studies (GWAS) relevant genes in the last layer, and to a successively lesser degree in the middle and first layers respectively. In contrast, we find an opposite gradient where a modular proteinprotein interaction signal is strongest in the first layer, but then vanishing smoothly deeper in the network. We conclude that a datadriven discovery approach is sufficient to discover groups of diseaserelated genes. The study of disease modules facilitates insight into complex diseases, but their identification relies on knowledge of molecular networks. Here, the authors show that disease modules and genes can also be discovered in deep autoencoder representations of large human gene expression datasets.",Sanjiv K.

994247ab7d594e648062addfd5ac8ca2,Suppressing hydrogen peroxide generation to achieve oxygeninsensitivity of a NiFe] hydrogenase in redox active films,"Redoxactive films were proposed as protective matrices for preventing oxidative deactivation of oxygensensitive catalysts such as hydrogenases for their use in fuel cells. However, the theoretical models predict quasiinfinite protection from oxygen and the aerobic halflife for hydrogenasecatalyzed hydrogen oxidation within redox films lasts only about a day. Here, we employ operando confocal microscopy to elucidate the deactivation processes. The hydrogen peroxide generated from incomplete reduction of oxygen induces the decomposition of the redox matrix rather than deactivation of the biocatalyst. We show that efficient dismutation of hydrogen peroxide by iodide extends the aerobic halflife of the catalytic film containing an oxygensensitive NiFe] hydrogenase to over one week, approaching the experimental anaerobic halflife. Altogether, our data support the theory that redox films make the hydrogenases immune against the direct deactivation by oxygen and highlight the importance of suppressing hydrogen peroxide production in order to reach complete protection from oxidative stress. Oxidative degradation impedes practical applications of highly active but fragile catalysts. Here the authors show that combining a protection matrix for O2 reduction and hydrogen peroxide decomposition stabilizes highly O2sensitive hydrogenase in the harsh oxidative conditions of operating fuel cells.",Huaiguang Li; Ute Munchberg; Alaa A.

Here we report a methodology to construct an electrochemically recoverable protective layer of polysulfides using an electrolyte additive. The additive nitrogendoped carbon dots maintain their ""dissolved"" status in the electrolyte at the full charge state, and some of them function as active sites for lithium sulfide growth at the full discharge state. When polysulfides are present amid the transition between sulfur and lithium sulfide, nitrogendoped carbon dots become highly reactive with polysulfides to form a solid and recoverable polysulfideencapsulating layer. This design skilfully avoids structural failure and efficiently suppresses polysulfide shuttling. The sulfur cathode delivers a high reversible capacity of 891 mAh g1 at 0.5 C with 99.5% coulombic efficiency and cycling stability up to 1000 cycles at 2 C.

Here, we show that POGZ regulates neuronal development and that ASDrelated de novo mutations impair neuronal development in the developing mouse brain and induced pluripotent cell lines from an ASD patient. We also develop the first mouse model heterozygous for a de novo POGZ mutation identified in a patient with ASD, and we identify ASDlike abnormalities in the mice. Importantly, social deficits can be treated by compensatory inhibition of elevated cell excitability in the mice. Our results provide insight into how de novo mutations on highconfidence ASD genes lead to impaired mature cortical network function, which underlies the cellular pathogenesis of NDDs, including ASD. De novo mutations significantly contribute to autism spectrum disorders (ASD). Here, the authors demonstrate that ASDassociated de novo mutations in the POGZ gene, one of a highconfidence ASD gene, lead to ASDrelated impaired neuronal development and disrupted mature cortical network function.",Kensuke Matsumura; Kaoru Seiriki; Shota Okada; Masashi Nagase; Shinya Ayabe; Ikuko Yamada; Tamio Furuse; Hirotoshi Shibuya; Yuka Yasuda; Hidenaga Yamamori; Michiko Fujimoto; Kazuki Nagayasu; Kana Yamamoto; Kohei Kitagawa; Hiroki Miura; Nanaka GotodaNishimura; Hisato Igarashi; Misuzu Hayashida; Masayuki Baba; Momoka Kondo; Shigeru Hasebe; Kosei Ueshima; Atsushi Kasai; Yukio Ago; Atsuko HayataTakano; Norihito Shintani; Tokuichi Iguchi; Makoto Sato; Shun Yamaguchi; Masaru Tamura; Shigeharu Wakana; Atsushi Yoshiki; Ayako M.

1999ee0bf8014edea2b3d5065d5dc578,A molecular switch regulating transcriptional repression and activation of PPAR,"Nuclear receptor (NR) transcription factors use a conserved activation function2 (AF2) helix 12 mechanism for agonistinduced coactivator interaction and NR transcriptional activation. In contrast, ligandinduced corepressordependent NR repression appears to occur through structurally diverse mechanisms. We report two crystal structures of peroxisome proliferatoractivated receptor gamma (PPAR) in an inverse agonistcorepressorbound transcriptionally repressive conformation. Helix 12 is displaced from the solventexposed active conformation and occupies the orthosteric ligandbinding pocket enabled by a conformational change that doubles the pocket volume. Paramagnetic relaxation enhancement (PRE) NMR and chemical crosslinking mass spectrometry confirm the repressive helix 12 conformation. PRE NMR also defines the mechanism of action of the corepressorselective inverse agonist T0070907, and reveals that apohelix 12 exchanges between transcriptionally active and repressive conformationssupporting a fundamental hypothesis in the NR field that helix 12 exchanges between transcriptionally active and repressive conformations. Structural studies of nuclear receptor transcription factors revealed that nearly all nuclear receptors share a conserved helix 12 dependent transcriptional activation mechanism. Here the authors present two crystal structures of peroxisome proliferatoractivated receptor gamma (PPAR) in an inverse agonistcorepressorbound transcriptionally repressive conformation, where helix 12 is located within the orthosteric ligandbinding pocket instead, and discuss mechanistic implications.",Jinsai Shang; Sarah A.

The first step of centrosome duplication is the daughter centriole formation followed by the pericentriolar material recruitment to this centriole. This maturation step was termed centrioletocentrosome conversion. It was proposed that CEP295dependent recruitment of pericentriolar proteins drives centriole conversion. Here we show, based on the analysis of proteins that promote centriole biogenesis, that the developing centriole structure helps drive centriole conversion. Depletion of the luminal centriole protein CEP44 that binds to the Amicrotubules and interacts with POC1B affecting centriole structure and centriole conversion, despite CEP295 binding to centrioles. Impairment of POC1B, TUBE1 or TUBD1, which disturbs integrity of centriole microtubules, also prevents centrioletocentrosome conversion. We propose that the CEP295, CEP44, POC1B, TUBE1 and TUBD1 centriole biogenesis pathway that functions in the centriole lumen and on the cytoplasmic side is essential for the centrioletocentrosome conversion. During cell division, centrosomes duplicate and newly formed centrioles must undergo centrioletocentrosome conversion, but the molecular details are unclear. Here, the authors report that the centriole microtubuletriplet 9fold structure scaffolds pericentriolar proteins and permits the conversion of centrioles to fully functional centrosomes.",Enrico S.

The resulting bottlenecks have a profound impact on the genetic makeup of a species with unknown consequences for health. A key genetic factor for species survival is the evolution of deleterious mutation load, but how bottleneck strength and mutation load interact lacks empirical evidence. We analyze 60 complete genomes of six ibex species and the domestic goat. We show that historic bottlenecks rather than the current conservation status predict levels of genomewide variation. By analyzing the exceptionally wellcharacterized population bottlenecks of the once nearly extinct Alpine ibex, we find genomic evidence of concurrent purging of highly deleterious mutations but accumulation of mildly deleterious mutations. This suggests that recolonization bottlenecks induced both relaxed selection and purging, thus reshaping the landscape of deleterious mutation load. Our findings highlight that even populations of ~1000 individuals can accumulate mildly deleterious mutations. Conservation efforts should focus on preventing population declines below such levels to ensure longterm survival of species. Although there is extensive theory predicting the effects of population bottlenecks on mutation load, there is little empirical evidence from recent bottlenecks.

Atom probe tomography (APT) and scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) are currently the most suitable tools because of their ability to probe materials at the nanoscale. Both techniques have limitations, particularly APT, because of insufficient understanding of void imaging. Here, we employ a correlative APT and STEM approach to investigate the APT imaging process and reveal that voids can lead to either an increase or a decrease in local atomic densities in the APT reconstruction. Simulated APT experiments demonstrate the local density variations near voids are controlled by the unique ring structures as voids open and the different evaporation fields of the surrounding atoms. We provide a general approach for quantifying chemical segregations near voids within an APT dataset, in which the composition can be directly determined with a higher accuracy than STEMbased techniques. Atom probe tomography can image chemical composition at the nanoscale, but our understanding of how it images voids, or empty spaces, is still lacking.

So far, no measurementbased GHG budgets were available, and plantation age was ignored in Life Cycle Analyses (LCA). Here, we conduct LCA based on measured CO2, CH4 and N2O fluxes in young and mature Indonesian oil palm plantations. CO2 dominates the onsite GHG budgets. The young plantation is a carbon source (1012  51 gC m2 yr1), the mature plantation a sink (754  38 gC m2 yr1). LCA considering the measured fluxes shows higher GHG emissions for palmoil biodiesel than traditional LCA assuming carbon neutrality. Plantation rotationcycle extension and earlieryielding varieties potentially decrease GHG emissions. Due to the high emissions associated with forest conversion to oil palm, our results indicate that only biodiesel from second rotationcycle plantations or plantations established on degraded land has the potential for pronounced GHG emission savings.

Typically, this is achieved by either chemical modification or by controlling the hierarchical structures of surfaces. Here we report a phenomenon whereby the wetting properties of vermiculite laminates are controlled by the hydrated cations on the surface and in the interlamellar space. We find that vermiculite laminates can be tuned from superhydrophilic to hydrophobic simply by exchanging the cations; hydrophilicity decreases with increasing cation hydration free energy, except for lithium. The lithiumexchanged vermiculite laminate is found to provide a superhydrophilic surface due to its anomalous hydrated structure at the vermiculite surface. Building on these findings, we demonstrate the potential application of superhydrophilic lithium exchanged vermiculite as a thin coating layer on microfiltration membranes to resist fouling, and thus, we address a major challenge for oilwater separation technology. Manipulation of surface energy and wetting properties of solids may impact a variety of processes, including membrane fouling.

Not all individuals who produce peanutspecific IgE will react upon consumption of peanut and can eat the food without adverse reactions, known as sensitized tolerance. Here, we employ highdimensional mass cytometry to define the circulating immune cell signatures associated with sensitized tolerance and clinical allergy to peanut in the first year of life. Key features of clinical peanut allergic are increased frequency of activated B cells (CD19hiHLADRhi), overproduction of TNF and increased frequency of peanutspecific memory CD4 T cells. Infants with sensitized tolerance display reduced frequency but hyperresponsive naive CD4 T cells and an increased frequency of plasmacytoid dendritic cells. This work demonstrates the utility and power of highdimensional mass cytometry analysis to interrogate the cellular interactions that are associated with allergic sensitization and clinical food allergy in the first year of life. Food allergy is triggered by IgE, but some individuals are not allergic to peanuts despite making peanutspecific IgE, and are considered peanuttolerant.

The circulation patterns for such systems have been elucidated by microearthquakes and geochemical data over a broad spectrum of spreading rates, but such data have not been generally available for ultraslow spreading ridges. Here we report new geophysical and fluid geochemical data for hightemperature active hydrothermal venting at Dragon Horn area (49.7E) on the Southwest Indian Ridge. Twin detachment faults penetrating to the depth of 13  2 km below the seafloor were identified based on the microearthquakes. The geochemical composition of the hydrothermal fluids suggests a long reaction path involving both mafic and ultramafic lithologies. Combined with numerical simulations, our results demonstrate that these hydrothermal fluids could circulate ~ 6 km deeper than the Moho boundary and to much greater depths than those at TransAtlantic Geotraverse and Logachev1 hydrothermal fields on the MidAtlantic Ridge. Magmatic and tectonic activity at midoceanic ridges can give detailed insights into hightemperature hydrothermal circulation of fluids. The authors here present geochemical and geophysical datasets that suggest a hydrothermal system penetrating the upper lithospheric mantle at an ultraslow spreading midoceanic ridge.",Chunhui Tao; W.

We find that the postmeasurement state of the nonlinear resonator exhibits a large correlation with the postmeasurement state of the ultrastrongly coupled system even when the coupling between measurement device and system is much smaller than the energy scales of the system itself.

The aim of this study was to determine whether a procedure using standard T1weighted magnetic resonance images provides an accurate estimate of bone marrow fat in children with typical development and in children with mild spastic cerebral palsy (CP; n  15group; 411 y). Magnetic resonance imaging was used to acquire T1weighted images. It was also used to acquire fat and water images using an iterative decomposition of water and fat with echo asymmetry and leastsquares estimation (IDEAL) technique. Bone marrow fat volume and fat fraction in the middlethird of the tibia were determined using the standard T1weighted images (BMFVT1 and BMFFT1, respectively) and the fat and water images (BMFVIDEAL and BMFFIDEAL, respectively). In both groups, BMFVT1 was highly correlated with (both r  0.99, p  0.001) and not different from (both p  0.05) BMFVIDEAL. In both groups, BMFFT1 was moderately correlated with (both r  0.71, p  0.01) and not different from (both p  0.05) BMFFIDEAL. There was no group difference in BMFVT1 or BMFVIDEAL (both p  0.05). BMFFIDEAL was higher in children with CP (p  0.05), but there was no group difference in BMFFT1 (p  0.05). We conclude that a procedure using standard T1weighted magnetic resonance images can produce estimates of bone marrow fat volume similar to estimates from the IDEAL technique in children. However, it is less sensitive to variation in the bone marrow fat fraction.",Chuan Zhang; Jill M. Slade; Freeman Miller; Christopher M.

In this work, a novel biocomposite coating was synthesised by mixing PCL with layers of calcium phosphate (hydroxyapatite, brushite and monetite) from a biomineral called otolith extracted from Teleost fish (Plagioscion Squamosissimus) and multiwalled carbon nanotubes in different concentrations (0.5, 1.0 and 1.5 gL). The biocomposite coating was deposited on an osteosynthesis material Ti6Al4V by spin coating and various tests such as Fourier transformation infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), Raman spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), scratch tests, MTT reduction cytotoxicity, HOS cell bioactivity (human osteosarcoma) by alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and fluorescence microscopy were performed to comprehensively evaluate the newly developed biocoating. It was found that an increase in the concentration of carbon nanotube induced microstructural phase changes of calcium phosphate (CP) leading to the formation of brushite, monetite and hydroxyapatite. While we discovered that an increase in the concentration of carbon nanotube generally improves the adhesion of the coating with the substrate, a certain threshold exists such that the best deposition surfaces were obtained as PCLCPCNT 0.0 gL and PCLCPCNT 0.5 gL.",Nerly D.

18974b91b049411899e72204e96dbd14,The Technome  A Predictive Internal Calibration Approach for Quantitative Imaging Biomarker Research,"The goal of radiomics is to convert medical images into a minable data space by extraction of quantitative imaging features for clinically relevant analyses, e.g. survival time prediction of a patient. One problem of radiomics from computed tomography is the impact of technical variation such as reconstruction kernel variation within a study. Additionally, what is often neglected is the impact of interpatient technical variation, resulting from patient characteristics, even when scan and reconstruction parameters are constant. In our approach, measurements within 3D regionsofinterests (ROI) are calibrated by further ROIs such as air, adipose tissue, liver, etc. that are used as control regions (CR). Our goal is to derive general rules for an automated internal calibration that enhance prediction, based on the analysed features and a set of CRs. We define qualification criteria motivated by statusquo radiomics stability analysis techniques to only collect information from the CRs which is relevant given a respective task. These criteria are used in an optimisation to automatically derive a suitable internal calibration for prediction tasks based on the CRs.

Here we identify properties of hypoglossal motor output to the tongue musculature. Tongue motor control is critical to the pathogenesis of obstructive sleep apnea, a common and serious sleeprelated breathing disorder. Studies were performed on mice expressing a light sensitive cation channel exclusively on cholinergic neurons (ChATChR2(H134R)EYFP). Discrete photostimulations under isofluraneinduced anesthesia from an optical probe positioned above the medullary surface and hypoglossal motor nucleus elicited discrete increases in tongue motor output, with the magnitude of responses dependent on stimulation power (P  0.001, n  7) and frequency (P  0.002, n  8, with responses to 10 Hz stimulation greater than for 1525 Hz, P  0.022). Stimulations during REM sleep elicited significantly reduced responses at powers 320 mW compared to nonrapid eye movement (nonREM) sleep and wakefulness (each P  0.05, n  7). Response thresholds were also greater in REM sleep (10 mW) compared to nonREM and waking (3 to 5 mW, P  0.05), and the slopes of the regressions between input photostimulation powers and output motor responses were specifically reduced in REM sleep (P  0.001). This study identifies that variations in photostimulation input produce tunable changes in hypoglossal motor output invivo and identifies REM sleep specific suppression of net motor excitability and responsivity.",Jasmin A.

The stability property of a quantum repeater entails that all incoming density matrices can be swapped with a target density matrix. The strong stability of a quantum repeater implies stable entanglement swapping with the boundness of stored density matrices in the quantum memory and the boundness of delays. Here, a theoretical framework of noisescaled stability analysis and entanglement rate maximization is conceived for the quantum Internet. We define the term of entanglement swapping set that models the status of quantum memory of a quantum repeater with the stored density matrices. We determine the optimal entanglement swapping method that maximizes the entanglement rate of the quantum repeaters at the different entanglement swapping sets as function of the noise of the local memory and local operations. We prove the stability properties for noncomplete entanglement swapping sets, complete entanglement swapping sets and perfect entanglement swapping sets. We prove the entanglement rates for the different entanglement swapping sets and noise levels.

We developed a luciferasebased assay, termed MalibuGlo Assay, which streamlines the process of optimization of an antigen binding domain with desirable properties and allows the sensitive detection of tumor antigens. The assay involves a recombinant immunoconjugate, termed MalibuGlo reagent, comprising an immunoglobulin or a nonimmunoglobulin based antigen binding domain genetically linked to a marine luciferase. MalibuGlo reagent can be conveniently produced in mammalian cells as a secreted protein that retains the functional activity of both the antigen binding domain and the luciferase. Moreover, crude supernatant containing the secreted MalibuGlo reagent can directly be used for detection of cell surface antigens obviating the laborious steps of protein purification and labeling. We further demonstrate the utility of MalibuGlo assay for the selection of optimal single chain fragment variables (scFvs) with desired affinity characteristics for incorporation into CARs. In summary, MalibuGlo assay is a fast, simple, sensitive, specific and economical assay for antigen detection with multiple applications in the fields of antibody engineering, antibody humanization and CART cell therapy.",Venkatesh Natarajan; Ramakrishnan Gopalakrishnan; Hittu Matta; Sunju Choi; Songjie Gong; Alberto Jeronimo; Pooja Smruthi Keerthipati; Anthony Morales; Harishwar Venkatesh; Preet M.

b49fdb9a98b343bcb6b17945f06f00d1,Extendedrange statistical ENSO prediction through operatortheoretic techniques for nonlinear dynamics,"Forecasting the El NinoSouthern Oscillation (ENSO) has been a subject of vigorous research due to the important role of the phenomenon in climate dynamics and its worldwide socioeconomic impacts. Over the past decades, numerous models for ENSO prediction have been developed, among which statistical models approximating ENSO evolution by linear dynamics have received significant attention owing to their simplicity and comparable forecast skill to firstprinciples models at short lead times. Yet, due to highly nonlinear and chaotic dynamics (particularly during ENSO initiation), such models have limited skill for longerterm forecasts beyond half a year. To resolve this limitation, here we employ a new nonparametric statistical approach based on analog forecasting, called kernel analog forecasting (KAF), which avoids assumptions on the underlying dynamics through the use of nonlinear kernel methods for machine learning and dimension reduction of highdimensional datasets. Through a rigorous connection with Koopman operator theory for dynamical systems, KAF yields statistically optimal predictions of future ENSO states as conditional expectations, given noisy and potentially incomplete data at forecast initialization. Here, using industrialera IndoPacific sea surface temperature (SST) as training data, the method is shown to successfully predict the Nino 3.4 index in a 19982017 verification period out to a 10month lead, which corresponds to an increase of 38 months (depending on the decade) over a benchmark linear inverse model (LIM), while significantly improving upon the ENSO predictability ""spring barrier"". In particular, KAF successfully predicts the historic 201516 El Nino at initialization times as early as June 2015, which is comparable to the skill of current dynamical models. An analysis of a 1300yr control integration of a comprehensive climate model (CCSM4) further demonstrates that the enhanced predictability afforded by KAF holds over potentially much longer leads, extending to 24 months versus 18 months in the benchmark LIM. Probabilistic forecasts for the occurrence of El NinoLa Nina events are also performed and assessed via informationtheoretic metrics, showing an improvement of skill over LIM approaches, thus opening an avenue for environmental risk assessment relevant in a variety of contexts.",Xinyang Wang; Joanna Slawinska; Dimitrios Giannakis,Climate sciences; Projection and prediction,"Center for Atmosphere Ocean Science, Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences, New York University, New York, USA; Department of Physics, University of WisconsinMilwaukee, Milwaukee, USA; Center for Atmosphere Ocean Science, Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences, New York University, New York, USA"

Debris pixels were accurately detected from the images taken of the laboratory channel and river water surfaces and were consistent with those detected by visual observation. The area fluxes were statistically significantly correlated with the mass fluxes measured through debris collection. The mass fluxes calculated by multiplying the area fluxes with the debris mass per unit area (MA) were significantly related to the flood rising stage flow rates and agreed with the mass fluxes measured through debris collection. In our algorithm, plastic mass fluxes can be estimated via calibration using the mass percentage of plastics to the total debris in target rivers.

36c010859c3e450a826121b5d29c3e7e,Gazeinwild: A dataset for studying eye and head coordination in everyday activities,"The study of gaze behavior has primarily been constrained to controlled environments in which the head is fixed. Consequently, little effort has been invested in the development of algorithms for the categorization of gaze events (e.g. fixations, pursuits, saccade, gaze shifts) while the head is free, and thus contributes to the velocity signals upon which classification algorithms typically operate. Our approach was to collect a novel, naturalistic, and multimodal dataset of eye  head movements when subjects performed everyday tasks while wearing a mobile eye tracker equipped with an inertial measurement unit and a 3D stereo camera. This GazeintheWild dataset (GW) includes eye  head rotational velocities (degs), infrared eye images and scene imagery (RGB  D). A portion was labelled by coders into gaze motion events with a mutual agreement of 0.74 sample based Cohen's . This labelled data was used to train and evaluate two machine learning algorithms, Random Forest and a Recurrent Neural Network model, for gaze event classification. Assessment involved the application of established and novel event based performance metrics. Classifiers achieve ~87% human performance in detecting fixations and saccades but fall short (50%) on detecting pursuit movements. Moreover, pursuit classification is far worse in the absence of head movement information. A subsequent analysis of feature significance in our best performing model revealed that classification can be done using only the magnitudes of eye and head movements, potentially removing the need for calibration between the head and eye tracking systems. The GW dataset, trained classifiers and evaluation metrics will be made publicly available with the intention of facilitating growth in the emerging area of headfree gaze event classification.",Rakshit Kothari; Zhizhuo Yang; Christopher Kanan; Reynold Bailey; Jeff B.

The films are nanostructured without grain boundaries, constituted by locally epitaxial nanoregions grown layerbylayer with outofplane (012) preferential orientation, induced by the constrain of the native silicon oxide. Low magnetic field ZFCFC magnetization curves show a crossover from superparamagnetic to ferromagnetic state dependent of the thickness. The thicker film (140 nm) exhibits typical ferromagnetic order. The thinner films (40 and 60 nm) exhibit superparamagnetic behavior attributed to interacting ferromagnetic monodomain nanoregions with critical size, random inplane oriented, where the intermonodomain boundaries with surface spinglass structure regulate the blocking of magnetization depending on the magnetic field intensity.

This study asks whether explicit order memory is enhanced for items sharing similar internallydriven temporal contexts. To tap internallydriven temporal context, we capitalized on the Temporal Contiguity Effect whereby recollection of one item promotes recall of adjacentlyencoded items. We compared pairs encoded and retrieved contiguously (contencret), whose items share internallydriven temporal contexts, to pairs retrieved, but not encoded, contiguously (contret) and to pairs encoded, but not retrieved, contiguously (contenc). Contencret pairs exhibited superior relative order over contret pairs, supporting accounts emphasizing shared temporal context as opposed to temporal distinctiveness in driving sequence memory. No difference was found in absolute order between the pair types, in line with theories suggesting a dissociation between relative and absolute order. Additionally, contencret and contenc pairs exhibited equivalent relative order, supporting the role of encoding as opposed to retrieval in the enhancement of relative order. Finally, contencret pairs were perceived as closer than contenc pairs, supporting the claim that contencret pairs constitute part of a temporallycoherent episode.

Smart building management systems equipped with portable, lowpower, noninvasive CO2 sensing techniques can predict room occupancy detection based on CO2 levels exhaled by humans. In this work, we have demonstrated the development and proofoffeasibility working of an electrochemical RTIL based sensor prototype for CO2 detection in exhaled human breath. The portability, small form factor, embedded RTIL sensing element, integrability with lowpower microelectronic and IOT interfaces makes this CO2 sensor prototype a potential application for passive room occupancy monitoring. This prototype exhibits a wide dynamic range of 4008000 ppm, a short response time of ~10 secs, and a reset time of ~6 secs in comparison to commercial standards. The calibration response of the prototype exhibits an R2 of 0.956. With RTIL as the sensing element, we have achieved a sensitivity of 29 pFppm towards CO2 at ambient environmental conditions and a three times greater selectivity towards CO2 in the presence of N2 and O2. CO2 detection is accomplished by quantifying the capacitance modulations arising within the electrical double layer from the RTIL CO2 interactions through AC based electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and DC based chronoamperometry.",Ashlesha Bhide; Badrinath Jagannath; Ambalika Tanak; Richard Willis; Shalini Prasad,Electrochemistry; Environmental monitoring,"Department of Biomedical Engineering, University of Texas at Dallas, Richardson, USA; Department of Biomedical Engineering, University of Texas at Dallas, Richardson, USA; Department of Biomedical Engineering, University of Texas at Dallas, Richardson, USA; Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Texas at Dallas, Richardson, USA; Department of Biomedical Engineering, University of Texas at Dallas, Richardson, USA"

Here we report a semiconductormetal hybrid structure (CuOAg) for CO oxidation that possesses very promising activity. Our firstprinciples calculations demonstrate that the significant improvement in this system's catalytic performance mainly comes from the polarized charge injection that results from the Schottky barrier formed at the CuOAg interface due to the work function differential there. Moreover, we propose a synergistic mechanism underlying the recovery process of this catalyst, which could significantly promote the recovery of oxygen vacancy created via the MvK mechanism.

Circadian rhythms govern daily oscillations in numerous physiological processes, and the underlying molecular components have been extensively described from fruit flies to mammals. Drosophila larvae have relatively simple nervous system compared to their adult counterparts, yet they both share a homologous molecular clock with mammals, governed by interlocking transcriptional feedback loops with highly conserved constituents. Larvae exhibit a robust light avoidance behavior, presumably enabling them to avoid predators and desiccation, and DNAdamage by exposure to ultraviolet light, hence are crucial for survival. Circadian rhythm has been shown to alter lightdark preference, however it remains unclear how distinct behavioral strategies are modulated by circadian time. To address this question, we investigate the larval visual navigation at different timepoints of the day employing a computerbased tracking system, which allows detailed evaluation of distinct navigation strategies. Our results show that due to circadian modulation specific to light information processing, larvae avoid light most efficiently at dawn, and a functioning clock mechanism at both molecular and neurosignaling level is necessary to conduct this modulation.",Ece Z.

b562fb45e4af4e4ea219876eb0325a61,A High Throughput Approach to Reconstruct PartialBody and Neutron Radiation Exposures on an Individual Basis,"Biodosimetrybased individualized reconstruction of complex irradiation scenarios (partialbody shielding andor neutron  photon mixtures) can improve treatment decisions after masscasualty radiationrelated incidents. We used a highthroughput micronucleus assay with automated scanning and imaging software on exvivo irradiated human lymphocytes to: a) reconstruct partialbody andor neutron exposure, and b) estimate separately the photon and neutron doses in a mixed exposure. The mechanistic background is that, compared with totalbody photon irradiations, neutrons produce more heavilydamaged lymphocytes with multiple micronucleibinucleated cell, whereas partialbody exposures produce fewer such lymphocytes. To utilize these differences for biodosimetry, we developed metrics that describe micronuclei distributions in binucleated cells and serve as predictors in machine learning or parametric analyses of the following scenarios: (A) Homogeneous gammairradiation, mimicking totalbody exposures, vs. mixtures of irradiated blood with unirradiated blood, mimicking partialbody exposures. (B) X rays vs. various neutron  photon mixtures. The results showed high accuracies of scenario and dose reconstructions. Specifically, receiver operating characteristic curve areas (AUC) for sample classification by exposure type reached 0.931 and 0.916 in scenarios A and B, respectively. R2 for actual vs. reconstructed doses in these scenarios reached 0.87 and 0.77, respectively.

Considering the necessity of alternative therapies for this disease of high economic impact and the reported regenerative and antibacterial effects of mesenchymal stem cell (MSCs), we evaluated the safety and efficacy of an allogenic MSCbased intramammary therapy in dairy cows with experimentally induced Staphylococcus aureus clinical mastitis. In a safety trial, heifers were inoculated intramammarily with a 2.5  107suspension of bovine fetal ATMSCs on experimental days 1 and 10. Animals were evaluated clinically on a daily basis during a 20day experimental period and blood samples were collected for hemogram determination and peripheral blood leukocytes (PBLs) isolation. In an efficacy trial, Holstein Friesian cows were inoculated with S. aureus and treated intramammarily with vehicle (NEG; days 4 and 10), antibiotics (ATB; days 4 and 5) or a suspension of 2.5  107 ATMSCs (MSC; days 4 and 5). Cows were clinically evaluated daily and milk samples were collected for somatic cell count (SCC) and colony forming units (CFU). Blood samples were collected for serum haptoglobin and amyloid A determination. Intramammary administration of two doses of bovine fetal ATMSCs in healthy cows did not induce changes in clinical or hematological variables, and gene expression profiles in PBLs associated to activation (CD4, CD8, CD25, CD62L and CD69) and proinflammatory cytokines (CCL2, CCL5, IL2, CXCL3, IFN, and TNF). Quarters of MSC group of cows had similar SCC logmL in milk compared to infected quarters of ATB or NEG cows. However, quarters of MSC cows had lower CFU logmL in milk compared to quarters of NEG cows. Intramammarily inoculation of repeated doses of 2.5  107 allogenic ATMSCs did not induce clinical or immunological response in healthy cows. Moreover, MSCintramammary treatment reduced bacterial count in milk of cows with S. aureus clinical mastitis compared to untreated cows. This work provides initial evidence for the safety and efficacy of an allogenic MSCbased intramammary therapy for the treatment of bovine mastitis.",O. A. Peralta; C. Carrasco; C. Vieytes; M. J.

e7af33d348ea4f089a009d4364dddf22,Impacts of Intralipid on Nanodrug Abraxane Therapy and on the Innate Immune System,"A major obstacle to nanodrugsmediated cancer therapy is their rapid uptake by the reticuloendothelial system that decreases the systemic exposure of the nanodrugs to tumors and also increases toxicities. Intralipid has been shown to reduce nanooxaliplatinmediated toxicity while improving bioavailability. Here, we have found that Intralipid reduces the cytotoxicity of paclitaxel for human monocytic cells, but not for breast, lung, or pancreatic cancer cells. Intralipid also promotes the polarization of macrophages to the anticancer M1like phenotype. Using a xenograft breast cancer mouse model, we have found that Intralipid pretreatment significantly increases the amount of paclitaxel reaching the tumor and promotes tumor apoptosis. The combination of Intralipid with half the standard clinical dose of Abraxane reduces the tumor growth rate as effectively as the standard clinical dose.

An adjustable thermoelastic model with the ability to control stability conditions is developed to examine the system behavior at different temperatures. To increase the performance range and improve system characteristics, a piezovoltage is applied and a spring is connected to the sliding end of the deformable beam as design parameters. The partial differential equations (PDEs) are derived using the extended Hamilton's principle and Galerkin decomposition is implemented to discretize the nonlinear equations, which are solved via a computational method called the stepbystep linearization method (SSLM). To improve the accuracy of the solution, the number of mode shapes and the size of voltage increments are analyzed and sufficient values are employed in the solution. The validity of the formulation and solution method is verified with experimental, analytical, and numerical data for several cases. Finally, the vibration and eigenvalue problem of the actuated nanomanipulator subjected to electrostatic and Casimir attractions are investigated. It is concluded that the fringingfields correction changes the system frequency, static equilibrium, and pullin characteristics significantly.

The present study reports unexplored structural variants of Kannurin those have functional benefits. Due to the difference in hydroxy fatty acid tail length, they are designated here as Kannurin A (mz 994.67  0.015), B (mz 1008.68  0.017), C (mz 1022.69  0.021), D (mz 1036.70  0.01), CL (mz 1040.71  0.02) and DL (mz 1054.72  0.01). The isoform A (mz 994.67  0.015) is the shortest cyclic form of Kannurin identified so far. In addition, CL (mz 1040.71  0.02) and DL (mz 1054.72  0.01) are the rare natural linear forms. The results of the antimicrobial assays deduced that the difference in lipid tail length of the isoforms contributes tremendous differences in their antimicrobial properties. The isoforms with short lipid tails (A and B) are more selective and potent towards bacteria, whereas the isoforms with long lipid tails (C and D) are more potent against fungi. The molecular dynamics studies and electron microscopic observations supported with circular dichroic spectroscopy analysis showed the structural confirmation and formation of aggregates of Kannurin in solution. The molecular dynamics simulation studies revealed that a single molecule of Kannurin makes enormous intramolecular interactions and structural rearrangements to attain stable lowest energy state in solution. When they reach a particular concentration (CMC) especially in aqueous environment, tends to form structural aggregates called 'micelles'.

TGF is strongly expressed in both the epithelial and stromal compartments of PDAC, and dysregulation of TGF signalling is a frequent molecular disturbance in PDAC progression and metastasis. In this study, we investigated whether blockade of TGF signalling synergizes with nalIRI5FULV, a chemotherapy regimen for malignant pancreatic cancer, in an orthotopic pancreatic tumour mouse model. Compared to nalIRI5FULV treatment, combining nalIRI5FULV with vactosertib, a TGF signalling inhibitor, significantly improved longterm survival rates and effectively suppressed invasion to surrounding tissues. Through RNAsequencing analysis, we identified that the combination treatment results in robust abrogation of tumourpromoting gene signatures and positive enrichment of tumoursuppressing and apoptotic gene signatures. Particularly, the expression of tumoursuppressing gene Ccdc80 was induced by vactosertib and further induced by vactosertib in combination with nalIRI5FULV. Ectopic expression of CCDC80 suppressed migration and colony formation concomitant with decreased expression of epithelialtomesenchymal transition (EMT) markers in pancreatic cancer cells. Collectively, these results indicate that combination treatment of vactosertib with nalIRI5FULV improves overall survival rates in a mouse model of pancreatic cancer by suppressing invasion through CCDC80. Therefore, combination therapy of nalIRI5FULV with vactosertib could provide clinical benefits to pancreatic cancer patients.",Eunji Hong; Sujin Park; Akira Ooshima; Chang Pyo Hong; Jinah Park; Jin Sun Heo; Siyoung Lee; Haein An; Jin Muk Kang; Seok Hee Park; Joon Oh Park; SeongJin Kim,Chemotherapy; Tumoursuppressor proteins,"Precision Medicine Research Center, Advanced Institute of Convergence Technology, Seoul National University, Suwon, Republic of Korea; Department of Biological Science, Sungkyunkwan University, Suwon, Republic of Korea; Precision Medicine Research Center, Advanced Institute of Convergence Technology, Seoul National University, Suwon, Republic of Korea; Precision Medicine Research Center, Advanced Institute of Convergence Technology, Seoul National University, Suwon, Republic of Korea; TheragenEtex Bio Institute, Suwon, Republic of Korea; Precision Medicine Research Center, Advanced Institute of Convergence Technology, Seoul National University, Suwon, Republic of Korea; Precision Medicine Research Center, Advanced Institute of Convergence Technology, Seoul National University, Suwon, Republic of Korea; Precision Medicine Research Center, Advanced Institute of Convergence Technology, Seoul National University, Suwon, Republic of Korea; Precision Medicine Research Center, Advanced Institute of Convergence Technology, Seoul National University, Suwon, Republic of Korea; Precision Medicine Research Center, Advanced Institute of Convergence Technology, Seoul National University, Suwon, Republic of Korea; Department of Biological Science, Sungkyunkwan University, Suwon, Republic of Korea; Department of Medicine, Samsung Medical Center, Sungkyunkwan University School of Medicine, Seoul, Republic of Korea; Precision Medicine Research Center, Advanced Institute of Convergence Technology, Seoul National University, Suwon, Republic of Korea; Department of Transdisciplinary Studies, Graduate School of Convergence Science and Technology, Seoul National University, Suwon, Republic of Korea; TheragenEtex Bio Institute, Suwon, Republic of Korea; Medpacto Inc., Seoul, Republic of Korea"

This maximizes its growth and production of polysaccharides (PS). The extracted polysaccharides have a complex monosaccharide composition (fructose, maltose, lactose and glucose), sulphate (210.65  10.5 mg g1 PS), uronic acids (171.97  5.7 mg g1 PS), total protein content (32.99  2.1 mg g1 PS), and total carbohydrate (495.44  8.4 mg g1 PS). Fourier Transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) analysis of the extracted polysaccharides showed the presence of NH, OH, CH, CH3, CH2, COO1, SO and the CO functional groups. UVVisible spectral analysis shows the presence of proteins, nucleic acids and chemical groups (ester, carbonyl, carboxyl and amine). Purified polysaccharides were light green in color and in a form of odorless powder. It was soluble in water but insoluble in other organic solvents. Thermogravimetric analysis demonstrates that Chlorella vulgaris soluble polysaccharide is thermostable until 240C and degradation occurs in three distinct phases. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) analysis showed the characteristic exothermic transition of Chlorella vulgaris soluble polysaccharides with crystallization temperature peaks at 144.1C, 162.3C and 227.7C. The Xray diffractogram illustrated the semicrystalline nature of these polysaccharides. Silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) had been biosynthesized using a solution of Chlorella vulgaris soluble polysaccharides. The pale green color solution of soluble polysaccharides was turned brown when it was incubated for 24 hours with 100 mM silver nitrate in the dark, it showed peak maximum located at 430 nm. FTIR analysis for the biosynthesized AgNPs reported the presence of carbonyl, CH3, CH2, CH,OH and NH functional groups. Scanning and transmission electron microscopy show that AgNPs have spherical shape with an average particle size of 5.76. Energydispersive Xray (EDX) analysis showed the dominance of silver. The biosynthesized silver nanoparticles were tested for its antimicrobial activity and have positive effects against Bacillus sp., Erwinia sp., Candida sp. Priming seeds of Triticum vulgare and Phaseolus vulgaris with polysaccharides solutions (3 and 5 mg mL1) resulted in significant enhancement of seedling growth.

However, multiple intrinsic cellular iron handling mechanisms may also influence the detection of magnetic resonance (MR) contrast: a need to differentiate among those mechanisms exists. In hepcidinmediated inflammation, for example, downregulation of iron export in monocytes and macrophages involves posttranslational degradation of ferroportin. We examined the influence of hepcidin endocrine activity on iron regulation and MR transverse relaxation rates in multipotent P19 cells, which display high iron import and export activities, similar to alternativelyactivated macrophages. Iron import and export were examined in cultured P19 cells in the presence and absence of ironsupplemented medium, respectively. Western blots indicated the levels of transferrin receptor, ferroportin and ubiquitin in the presence and absence of extracellular hepcidin. Total cellular iron was measured by inductivelycoupled plasma mass spectrometry and correlated to transverse relaxation rates at 3 Tesla using a gelatin phantom. Under varying conditions of iron supplementation, the level of ferroportin in P19 cells responds to hepcidin regulation, consistent with degradation through a ubiquitinmediated pathway. This response of P19 cells to hepcidin is similar to that of classicallyactivated macrophages. The correlation between total cellular iron content and MR transverse relaxation rates was different in hepcidintreated and untreated P19 cells: slope, Pearson correlation coefficient and relaxation rate were all affected. These findings may provide a tool to noninvasively distinguish changes in endogenous iron contrast arising from hepcidinferroportin interactions, with potential utility in monitoring of different macrophage phenotypes involved in pro and antiinflammatory signaling. In addition, this work demonstrates that transverse relaxivity is not only influenced by the amount of cellular iron but also by its metabolism.",Kobra Alizadeh; Qin Sun; Tabitha McGuire; Terry Thompson; Frank S.

Opening of the BBB during a stroke has a negative impact on acute outcomes. We have recently demonstrated that miR34a regulates the BBB by targeting cytochrome c (CYC) in vitro. To investigate the role of miR34a in a stroke, we purified primary cerebrovascular endothelial cells (pCECs) from mouse brains following 1 h transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (tMCAO) and measured realtime PCR to detect miR34a levels. We demonstrate that the miR34a levels are elevated in pCECs from tMCAO mice at the time point of BBB opening following 1 h tMCAO and reperfusion. Interestingly, knockout of miR34a significantly reduces BBB permeability, alleviates disruption of tight junctions, and improves stroke outcomes compared to wildtype (WT) controls. CYC is decreased in the ischemic hemispheres and pCECs from WT but not in miR34a mice following stroke reperfusion. We further confirmed CYC is a target of miR34a by a dural luciferase reporter gene assay in vitro. Our study provides the first description of miR34a affecting stroke outcomes and may lead to discovery of new mechanisms and treatments for cerebrovascular and neurodegenerative diseases such as stroke.",Heng Hu; Emily A.

Pre and postprocedural measures of pain, anxiety, device experience and vital signs were measured. There were no significant differences between groups (VRno VR) in pain scores (60.68 vs 49.76; p  0.2), ECV success rates (80% vs 76%; p  0.7) or anxiety levels. The women receiving VR had a significantly higher anticipation of pain preprocedurally (70.0 vs 50.0; p  0.03). 20 (80%) of the VR women indicated that they would use VR again and 22 (88%) indicated they would recommend it to a friend having ECV.

abb6186846e64096a3f76ebe0f52a170,Fecal bacteria and metabolite responses to dietary lysozyme in a sow model from late gestation until lactation,"Lysozyme (LZM) is a natural antibacterial protein that is found in the saliva, tears and milk of all mammals including humans. Its antibacterial properties result from the ability to cleave bacterial cell walls, causing bacterial death. The current study was conducted to investigate the effects of dietary LZM on fecal microbial composition and variation in metabolites in sow. The addition of LZM decreased the fecal shortchain fatty acids (SCFAs). Zonulin and endotoxin in the serum, and feces, were decreased with lysozyme supplementation. Furthermore, fecal concentrations of lipocalin2 and the proinflammatory cytokine TNF were also decreased while the antiinflammatory cytokine IL10 was increased by lysozyme supplementation. 16S rRNA gene sequencing of the V3V4 region suggested that fecal microbial levels changed at different taxonomic levels with the addition of LZM. Representative changes included the reduction of diversity between sows, decreased Bacteroidetes, Actinobacteria, Tenericutes and Spirochaetes during lactation as well as an increase in Lactobacillus. These findings suggest that dietary lysozyme supplementation from late gestation to lactation promote microbial changes, which would potentially be the mechanisms by which maternal metabolites and inflammatory status was altered after LZM supplementation.",Shengyu Xu; Jiankai Shi; Yanpeng Dong; Zimei Li; Xiaoling Wu; Yan Lin; Lianqiang Che; Jian Li; Bin Feng; Zhengfeng Fang; Yong Zhuo; Jianping Wang; De Wu; Zhihua Ren; Yanping Shen,Animal physiology; Microbiology; Physiology,"Animal Nutrition Institute, Sichuan Agricultural University, Key laboratory of Animal Diseaseresistant Nutrition, Ministry of Education, Key laboratory of Animal Diseaseresistant Nutrition, Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs, Key laboratory of Animal Diseaseresistant Nutrition, Sichuan Province, Chengdu, P.

dc12a4255d644fa7bf02b42f307863f4,Economic Diversification Supported the Growth of Mongolia's Nomadic Empires,"Populations in Mongolia from the late second millennium B.C.E. through the Mongol Empire are traditionally assumed, by archaeologists and historians, to have maintained a highly specialized horsefacilitated form of mobile pastoralism. Until recently, a dearth of direct evidence for prehistoric human diet and subsistence economies in Mongolia has rendered systematic testing of this view impossible. Here, we present stable carbon and nitrogen isotope measurements of human bone collagen, and stable carbon isotope analysis of human enamel bioapatite, from 137 welldated ancient Mongolian individuals spanning the period c. 4400 B.C.E. to 1300 C.E. Our results demonstrate an increase in consumption of C4 plants beginning at c. 800 B.C.E., almost certainly indicative of millet consumption, an interpretation supported by archaeological evidence. The escalating scale of millet consumption on the eastern Eurasian steppe over time, and an expansion of isotopic niche widths, indicate that historic Mongolian empires were supported by a diversification of economic strategies rather than uniform, specialized pastoralism.",Shevan Wilkin; Alicia Ventresca Miller; Bryan K.

558b505ada1b42e6b9b666c8ffb0b853,Pore Structure Changes Occur During CO 2 Injection into Carbonate Reservoirs,"Observations and modeling studies have shown that during CO2 injection into underground carbonate reservoirs, the dissolution of CO2 into formation water forms acidic brine, leading to fluidrock interactions that can significantly impact the hydraulic properties of the host formation. However, the impacts of these interactions on the pore structure and macroscopic flow properties of host rock are poorly characterized both for the nearwellbore region and deeper into the reservoir. Little attention has been given to the influence of pressure drop from the nearwellbore region to reservoir body on disturbing the ionic equilibrium in the CO2saturated brine and consequent mineral precipitation. In this paper, we present the results of a novel experimental procedure designed to address these issues in carbonate reservoirs. We injected CO2saturated brine into a composite core made of two matching grainstone carbonate core plugs with a tight disk placed between them to create a pressure profile of around 250 psi resembling that prevailing in reservoirs during CO2 injection. We investigated the impacts of fluidrock interactions at pore and continuum scale using medical Xray CT, nuclear magnetic resonance, and scanning electron microscopy. We found that strong calcite dissolution occurs near to the injection point, which leads to an increase in primary intergranular porosity and permeability of the near injection region, and ultimately to wormhole  formation. The strong heterogeneous dissolution of calcite grains leads to the formation of intragranular micropores. At later stages of the dissolution, the internal regions of ooids become accessible to the carbonated brine, leading to the formation of moldic porosity. At distances far from the injection point, we observed minimal or no change in pore structure, pore roughness, pore populations, and rock hydraulic properties. The pressure drop of 250 psi slightly disturbed the chemical equilibrium of the system, which led to minor precipitation of submicron sized calcite crystals but due to the large pore throats of the rock, these deposits had no measurable impact on rock permeability. The trial illustrates that the new procedure is valuable for investigating fluidrock interactions by reproducing the geochemical consequences of relatively steep pore pressure gradients during CO2 injection.",Mojtaba Seyyedi; Hisham Khaled Ben Mahmud; Michael Verrall; Ausama Giwelli; Lionel Esteban; Mohsen Ghasemiziarani; Ben Clennell,Carbon capture and storage; Chemical engineering; Energy,"Australian Resources Research Centre, CSIRO, Kensington, Australia; Curtin University Malaysia, CDT 250, Miri Sarawak, Malaysia; Australian Resources Research Centre, CSIRO, Kensington, Australia; Australian Resources Research Centre, CSIRO, Kensington, Australia; Australian Resources Research Centre, CSIRO, Kensington, Australia; Curtin University, Bentley, Australia; Australian Resources Research Centre, CSIRO, Kensington, Australia"
7d03bfb0509c4b63bee62bafdfbf91f2,Multimodal imaging reveals transient liver metabolic disturbance and sinusoidal circulation obstruction after a single administration of ketaminexylazine mixture,"A ketaminexylazine (KX) mixture is widely used before and during experiments in rodents. However, the impact of shortterm use of KX mixture and its influences on data interpretation have rarely been discussed. In this study, we administered one shot of a KX mixture and examined acute hepatic responses using biochemical analysis, histopathological examination, and noninvasive imaging to determine the delay required prior to further assessment of the liver to avoid confounding effects triggered by anaesthesia. After the KX injection, aspartate aminotransferase (AST) in serum was significantly elevated from 3 to 48 h. Obstructed sinusoidal circulation lasting for 24 or 36 h was revealed by DCEMRI and drug distribution analysis, respectively. Metabolic alterations were detected at 3 h by NMR analysis and FDGPET. Moreover, ultrasonography showed that lipid droplet accumulation increased from 1 to 16 h and declined thereafter. Taken together, our findings show that the KX mixture induces acute hepatotoxicity and metabolic disturbance, and these disturbances cause hemodynamical disorders in the liver. The required time interval for recovery from KX impact was dependent on the chosen assay. It took at least 16 h for metabolic recovery and 36 h for recovery of sinusoidal circulation. However, the liver was not fully recovered from the injury within 48 h.",FangHsin Chen; ChingFang Yu; ChungLin Yang; YuChun Lin; Gigin Lin; ChunChieh Wang; HuangPing Yu; Jui Fang; NingFang Chang; JiHong Hong,Metabolism; Preclinical research,"Department of Medical Imaging and Radiological Sciences, Chang Gung University, Taoyuan, Taiwan; Department of Radiation Oncology, Chang Gung Memorial Hospital Linkou Branch, Taoyuan, Taiwan; Radiation Biology Research Center, Institute for Radiological Research, Chang Gung UniversityChang Gung Memorial Hospital Linkou Branch, Taoyuan, Taiwan; Department of Radiation Oncology, Chang Gung Memorial Hospital Linkou Branch, Taoyuan, Taiwan; Department of Medical Imaging and Radiological Sciences, Chang Gung University, Taoyuan, Taiwan; Department of Medical Imaging and Radiological Sciences, Chang Gung University, Taoyuan, Taiwan; Department of Medical Imaging and Intervention, Chang Gung Memorial Hospital Linkou Branch, Taoyuan, Taiwan; Department of Medical Imaging and Intervention, Chang Gung Memorial Hospital Linkou Branch, Taoyuan, Taiwan; Imaging Core Laboratory, Institute for Radiological Research, Chang Gung UniversityChang Gung Memorial Hospital Linkou Branch, Taoyuan, Taiwan; Clinical Metabolomics Core Laboratory, Chang Gung Memorial Hospital Linkou Branch, Taoyuan, Taiwan; Department of Medical Imaging and Radiological Sciences, Chang Gung University, Taoyuan, Taiwan; Department of Radiation Oncology, Chang Gung Memorial Hospital Linkou Branch, Taoyuan, Taiwan; Radiation Biology Research Center, Institute for Radiological Research, Chang Gung UniversityChang Gung Memorial Hospital Linkou Branch, Taoyuan, Taiwan; Department of Anesthesiology, Chang Gung Memorial Hospital Linkou Branch, Taoyuan, Taiwan; Department of Biomedical Engineering, Chang Gung University, Taoyuan, Taiwan; Department of Medical Imaging and Radiological Sciences, Chang Gung University, Taoyuan, Taiwan; Department of Medical Imaging and Radiological Sciences, Chang Gung University, Taoyuan, Taiwan; Department of Radiation Oncology, Chang Gung Memorial Hospital Linkou Branch, Taoyuan, Taiwan; Radiation Biology Research Center, Institute for Radiological Research, Chang Gung UniversityChang Gung Memorial Hospital Linkou Branch, Taoyuan, Taiwan"
c1e51fb19c6e461f9f191efbf9356b68,Epistatic Effect of Regulators to the Adaptive Growth of Escherichia coli,"Bacteria survive in the environment with three steps: a sensing environmental conditions, a responding to sensed signals, and an adaptation for proper survival in the environment. An adapting bacterial cell occurs cell division to increase the number of sister cells, termed adaptive growth. Twocomponent systems (TCSs), representing the main bacterial signal transduction systems, consist of a pair of one sensor kinase (SK) and one response regulator (RR), and RR genes are abundant in most bacterial genomes as part of the core genome. The OmpR gene family, a group of RR genes, is conserved in 95% of known bacterial genomes. The Escherichia coli genome has an estimated 34 RR genes in total, including 14 genes of OmpR family genes. To reveal the contribution of TCSs for fast growth as an adaptive growth strategy of E. coli, we isolated a set of gene knockout strains by using newly developed genome editing technology, the HoSeI (Homologous Sequence Integration) method, based on CRISPRCas9. The statistics of single cell observation show a knockout of an arbitrary pair of phoP, phoB, and ompR genes, stably expressed by positive feedback regulation, dramatically inhibit the optimum adaptive growth of E. coli. These insights suggest that the adaptive growth of bacteria is fulfilled by the optimum high intracellular level of regulators acquired during growth under environmental conditions.",Yukari Miyake; Kaneyoshi Yamamoto,Genetic engineering; Synthetic biology,"Hosei University, Department of Frontier Bioscience, Koganei, Tokyo, Japan; Hosei University, Department of Frontier Bioscience, Koganei, Tokyo, Japan; Hosei University, Research Institute of MicroNano Technology, Koganei, Tokyo, Japan"

We used a genomic approach to study a set of isolates from different sources and years. Whole genome phylogeny showed that most of the strains are distributed in two major lineages (E1 and E2), both belonging to MLST sequence type 11 the major ST among serovar Enteritidis. Strikingly, E2 isolates are overrepresented in periods of outbreak abundance in Uruguay, while E1 span all epidemic periods. Both lineages circulate in neighbor countries at the same timescale as in Uruguay, and are present in minor numbers in distant countries. We identified allelic variants associated with each lineage. Three genes, ycdX, pduD and hsdM, have distinctive variants in E1 that may result in defective products. Another four genes (ybiO, yiaN, aas, aceA) present variants specific for the E2 lineage. Overall this work shows that S. enterica serovar Enteritidis strains circulating in Uruguay have the same phylogenetic profile than strains circulating in the region, as well as in more distant countries. Based on these results we hypothesize that the E2 lineage, which is more prevalent during epidemics, exhibits a combination of allelic variants that could be associated with its epidemic ability.",Bruno D'Alessandro; Victoria Perez Escanda; Lucia Balestrazzi; Florencia Grattarola; Andres Iriarte; Derek Pickard; Lucia Yim; Jose Alejandro Chabalgoity; Laura Betancor,Bacterial genomics; Phylogenetics,"Departamento de Desarrollo Biotecnologico, Instituto de Higiene, Facultad de Medicina, Universidad de la Republica, Montevideo, Uruguay; Departamento de Desarrollo Biotecnologico, Instituto de Higiene, Facultad de Medicina, Universidad de la Republica, Montevideo, Uruguay; Departamento de Desarrollo Biotecnologico, Instituto de Higiene, Facultad de Medicina, Universidad de la Republica, Montevideo, Uruguay; Departamento de Bacteriologia y Virologia, Instituto de Higiene, Facultad de Medicina, Universidad de la Republica, Montevideo, Uruguay; Departamento de Desarrollo Biotecnologico, Instituto de Higiene, Facultad de Medicina, Universidad de la Republica, Montevideo, Uruguay; Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute, Wellcome Trust Genome Campus, Hinxton, Cambridge, UK; Departamento de Desarrollo Biotecnologico, Instituto de Higiene, Facultad de Medicina, Universidad de la Republica, Montevideo, Uruguay; Departamento de Desarrollo Biotecnologico, Instituto de Higiene, Facultad de Medicina, Universidad de la Republica, Montevideo, Uruguay; Departamento de Desarrollo Biotecnologico, Instituto de Higiene, Facultad de Medicina, Universidad de la Republica, Montevideo, Uruguay; Departamento de Bacteriologia y Virologia, Instituto de Higiene, Facultad de Medicina, Universidad de la Republica, Montevideo, Uruguay"
58660bbb4cb247d6b4ba7921604abeef,Modulation of feeding behavior and metabolism by dynorphin,"The neuronal regulation of metabolic and behavioral responses to different diets and feeding regimens is an important research area. Herein, we investigated if the opioid peptide dynorphin modulates feeding behavior and metabolism. Mice lacking dynorphin peptides (KO) were exposed to either a normal diet (ND) or a highfat diet (HFD) for a period of 12 weeks. Additionally, mice had either timerestricted (TR) or ad libitum (AL) access to food. Body weight, food intake and blood glucose levels were monitored throughout the 12week feeding schedule. Brain samples were analyzed by immunohistochemistry to detect changes in the expression levels of hypothalamic peptides. As expected, animals on HFD or having AL access to food gained more weight than mice on ND or having TR access. Unexpectedly, KO females on TR HFD as well as KO males on AL ND or AL HFD demonstrated a significantly increased body weight gain compared to the respective WT groups. The calorie intake differed only marginally between the genotypes: a significant difference was present in the female ND AL group, where dynorphin KO mice ate more than WT mice. Although female KO mice on a TR feeding regimen consumed a similar amount of food as WT controls, they displayed significantly higher levels of blood glucose. We observed significantly reduced levels of hypothalamic orexigenic peptides neuropeptide Y (NPY) and orexinA in KO mice. This decrease became particularly pronounced in the HFD groups and under AL condition. The kappa opiod receptor (KOR) levels were higher after HFD compared to ND feeding in the ventral pallidum of WT mice. We hypothesize that HFD enhances dynorphin signaling in this hedonic center to maintain energy homeostasis, therefore KO mice have a more pronounced phenotype in the HFD condition due to the lack of it. Our data suggest that dynorphin modulates metabolic changes associated with TR feeding regimen and HFD consumption. We conclude that the lack of dynorphin causes uncoupling between energy intake and body weight gain in mice; KO mice maintained on HFD become overweight despite their normal food intake. Thus, using kappa opioid receptor agonists against obesity could be considered as a potential treatment strategy.",Aishwarya Ghule; Ildiko Racz; Andras BilkeiGorzo; Este Leidmaa; Meike Sieburg; Andreas Zimmer,Feeding behaviour; Molecular medicine,"Institute of Molecular Psychiatry, University of Bonn, Medical Faculty, Bonn, Germany; Institute of Molecular Psychiatry, University of Bonn, Medical Faculty, Bonn, Germany; Department of Neurodegenerative Diseases  Geriatric Psychiatry University of Bonn, Medical Faculty, Bonn, Germany; Institute of Molecular Psychiatry, University of Bonn, Medical Faculty, Bonn, Germany; Institute of Molecular Psychiatry, University of Bonn, Medical Faculty, Bonn, Germany; Institute of Molecular Psychiatry, University of Bonn, Medical Faculty, Bonn, Germany; Aarhus University, Department of BiomedicineDANDRITE Capogna group, Aarhus C, Denmark; Institute of Molecular Psychiatry, University of Bonn, Medical Faculty, Bonn, Germany"
ba8dd17da087478499127e98a838c96c,Imaging Cherenkov emission for quality assurance of highdoserate brachytherapy,"With advances in highdoserate (HDR) brachytherapy, the importance of quality assurance (QA) is increasing to ensure safe delivery of the treatment by measuring dose distribution and positioning the source with much closer intervals for highly active sources. However, conventional QA is timeconsuming, involving the use of several different measurement tools. Here, we developed simple QA method for HDR brachytherapy based on the imaging of Cherenkov emission and evaluated its performance. Light emission from pure water irradiated by an 192Ir ray source was captured using a chargecoupled device camera. Monte Carlo calculations showed that the observed light was primarily Cherenkov emissions produced by Comptonscattered electrons from the rays. The uncorrected Cherenkov light distribution, which was 5% on average except near the source (within 7 mm from the centre), agreed with the dose distribution calculated using the treatment planning system. The accuracy was attributed to isotropic radiation and shortrange Compton electrons. The source positional interval, as measured from the light images, was comparable to the expected intervals, yielding spatial resolution similar to that permitted by conventional film measurements. The method should be highly suitable for quick and easy QA investigations of HDR brachytherapy as it allows simultaneous measurements of dose distribution, source strength, and source position using a single image.",Katsunori Yogo; Akihiro Matsushita; Yuya Tatsuno; Takahiro Shimo; Seiko Hirota; Marika Nozawa; Shuichi Ozawa; Hiromichi Ishiyama; Hiroshi Yasuda; Yasushi Nagata; Kazushige Hayakawa,Applied physics; Optics and photonics; Quantum physics; Techniques and instrumentation,"Graduate School of Medicine, Nagoya University, 1120 Daikominami, Higashiku, Nagoya, Japan; Graduate School of Medical Science, Kitasato University, 1151 Kitasato, Minami, Sagamihara, Japan; Graduate School of Medical Science, Kitasato University, 1151 Kitasato, Minami, Sagamihara, Japan; Graduate School of Medical Science, Kitasato University, 1151 Kitasato, Minami, Sagamihara, Japan; Department of Radiology, Tokyo Nishi Tokushukai Hospital, 311 Matsubaracho, Akishima, Tokyo, Japan; Department of Radiation Biophysics, Research Institute for Radiation Biology and Medicine, Hiroshima University, Kasumi 123, Minamiku, Hiroshima, Japan; School of Medicine, Kitasato University, 1151 Kitasato, Minami, Sagamihara, Japan; Hiroshima High Precision Radiotherapy Cancer Center, 322 Futabanosato, Higashiku, Hiroshima, Japan; Department of Radiation Oncology, Hiroshima University Hospital, 123 Kasumi, Minamiku, Hiroshima, Japan; Graduate School of Medical Science, Kitasato University, 1151 Kitasato, Minami, Sagamihara, Japan; School of Medicine, Kitasato University, 1151 Kitasato, Minami, Sagamihara, Japan; Department of Radiation Biophysics, Research Institute for Radiation Biology and Medicine, Hiroshima University, Kasumi 123, Minamiku, Hiroshima, Japan; Hiroshima High Precision Radiotherapy Cancer Center, 322 Futabanosato, Higashiku, Hiroshima, Japan; Department of Radiation Oncology, Hiroshima University Hospital, 123 Kasumi, Minamiku, Hiroshima, Japan; Graduate School of Medical Science, Kitasato University, 1151 Kitasato, Minami, Sagamihara, Japan; School of Medicine, Kitasato University, 1151 Kitasato, Minami, Sagamihara, Japan"

However, impact of temperature on flavor has not been reported. Here, we examined Scylla paramamosain collected within the main four producing areas in China from north sampling point (NP) and south sampling point (SP), respectively. The contents of flavouringrelated substances in hepatopancreas, muscles and gonads were determined by highperformance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Meanwhile, highthroughput sequencing of 16S RNA gene was used to reveal the diversity distribution of gut microbiota at each sample collection point. Comparisons among flavor substances of edible parts, the implied higher temperature in SP may be beneficial to the accumulation of flavor substances in gonads, while lower temperature in NP may be beneficial to the accumulation of flavor substances in muscles and hepatopancreas. The gut microbiota of crabs, was analyzed via 16S rRNA gene sequencing. The results of gut microbiota showed that there were significant differences in the distribution of gut microbiota in NP and SP. The microbiota composition of SP has a high distribution richness and no absolute dominant bacteria, while NP has absolute dominant bacteria and its microbiota richness was lower than SP. The results of redundancy analysis (RDA) showed that there was a significant correlation between temperature and the relative abundance of gut microbiota, and a significant correlation between gut microbiota and the content of flavor substances. This study indicates that temperature may be one of the main factors for the differences of flavor substances between SP and NP, which was most probably mediated by gut microbiota.

Although primary PCa can be controlled with surgery or radiation, treatment options of preventing metastatic PCa are still limited. To develop a new treatment of eradicating metastatic PCa, we have created an injectable cancer trap that can actively recruit cancer cells in bloodstream. The cancer trap is composed of hyaluronic acid microparticles that have good cell and tissue compatibility and can extend the release of chemokines to 4 days in vitro. We find that erythropoietin (EPO) and stromal derived factor1 can attract PCa in vitro. Animal results show that EPOreleasing cancer trap attracted large number of circulating PCa and significantly reduced cancer spreading to other organs compared with controls.

Glia maturation factor (GMF) Ser83 phosphorylation by protein kinase A (PKA) is pivotal in the activation of GMFp38MAPKNFB biochemical pathway towards proinflammatory response induction in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). Using structurebased drug design, we identified the small molecule inhibitor 1Hindazole4yl methanol (GMFBI.1) that specifically blocked Ser83 phosphorylation site on GMF substrate. Using in vitro and in vivo techniques, molecular mechanism of action of GMFBI.1's direct interaction with GMF substrate and prevention of its Ser83 phosphorylation was established. GMFBI.1 down regulated p38MAPK phosphorylation and NFB expression essential for proinflammatory response. Further, GMFBI.1 administration at peak of EAE reversed clinical symptoms, immunopathology, proinflammatory cytokine response and up regulated the antiinflammatory cytokines. Present strategy of substrate inhibition against the key immunomodulatory target has immense therapeutic potential in MS.",Jane Jose Vattathara; Ohm Prakash; Sunitha Subhramanian; Madathiparambil Kumaran Satheeshkumar; Tessy Xavier; Meenakshi Anil; Gopal S.

Twenty volunteers (10 men, 10 women) participated in two sessions at intervals of one week. Cold and warm detection threshold (CDTWDT), cold and heat pain threshold (CPTHPT), mechanical detection and pain threshold (MDTMPT), pressure pain threshold (PPT) and twopoint discrimination (2PD) were measured at five sites: bilateral subauricular and postauricular sites (LA, RA, LB, RB) and the dorsum of left hand (control). Pressure stimulation was applied at each of the four periauricular test sites. The testretest reliability of the QST data implied fair to excellent agreement as evaluated by the intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC; all 0.4) for different days. There was no difference between each side in the QST parameters and mechanical sensitivity mapping (P  0.057). Significant differences between subauricular and postauricular sites were shown for WDT and PPT (P  0.028). NRS scores of mechanical sensitivity mapping showed significant effects of gender, site and point (P  0.040).

As a result, novel therapeutic agents to improve the current situation are needed urgently. Curcumin, a polyphenolic colorant derived from Curcuma longa root, showed pleiotropic influences on cellular pathways in vitro and amongst others anticancer properties including sensitization of tumor cells to chemo and radiationtherapy. In this study, we evaluated the impact of Curcumin on the radiosensitivity of the established human pancreatic cancer cell lines Panc1 and MiaPaCa2 in vitro. In contrast to MiaPaCa2 cells, we found a significant radiosensitization by Curcumin in the more radioresistant Panc1 cells, possibly caused by cell cycle arrest in the most radiationsensitive G2Mphase at the time of irradiation. Furthermore, a significant enhancement of radiationinduced apoptosis, DNAdoublestrand breaks and G2Marrest after curcumin treatment was observed in both cell lines. These in vitro findings suggest that especially patients with more radioresistant tumors could benefit from a radiationconcomitant, phytotherapeutic therapy with Curcumin.",Katharina Schwarz; Sophie Dobiasch; Lily Nguyen; Daniela Schilling; Stephanie E.

We investigated the relationship between medication adherence as a continuous measure and outcomes in MI survivors using restricted cubic splines (RCS). We identified all patients aged 65 years hospitalised for MI from 20032008 who survived oneyear postdischarge (n  5938). Adherence to statins, betablockers, renin angiotensin system inhibitors (RASI) and clopidogrel was calculated using proportion of days covered to oneyear postdischarge (landmark date). Outcomes were 1year allcause death and major adverse cardiac events (MACE) after the landmark date. Adherenceoutcome associations were estimated from RCS Cox regression models. RCS analyses indicated decreasing risk for both outcomes above 60% adherence for statins, RASI and clopidogrel, with each 10% increase in adherence associated with a 13.9%, 12.1% and 18.0% decrease respectively in adjusted risk of allcause death (all p  0.02). Similar results were observed for MACE (all p  0.03). Betablockers had no effect on outcomes at any level of adherence. In MI survivors, increasing adherence to statins, RASI, and clopidogrel, but not beta blockers, is associated with a decreasing risk of deathMACE with no adherence threshold beyond 60%.

5d3cb0a8cc064749bf663a1cef0e8c9e,The LRRK2 Nterminal domain influences vesicle trafficking: impact of the E193K variant,"The LRRK2 protein consists of multiple functional domains, including proteinbinding domains at its N and Cterminus. Mutations in the Leucinerich repeat kinase 2 gene (LRRK2) have been linked to familial and sporadic Parkinson's disease (PD). We have recently described a novel variant falling within the Nterminal armadillo repeats, E193K. Herein, our aim is to investigate the functional impact of LRRK2 Nterminal domain and the E193K variant on vesicle trafficking. By combining Total Internal Reflection Fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy and a synaptopHluorin assay, we found that expression of a construct lacking the Nterminal domain increases the frequency and amplitude of spontaneous synaptic events. Complementary biochemical approaches showed that the E193K variant alters the binding properties of LRRK2, decreases LRRK2 binding to synaptic vesicles, and promotes vesicle fusion. Our results confirm the physiological and pathological relevance of the nature of the LRRK2associated macromolecular complex solidifying the idea that different pathological mutations critically alter the scaffolding function of LRRK2 resulting in a perturbation of the vesicular trafficking as a common denominator.",Algerta Marku; Maria Dolores Perez Carrion; Francesca Pischedda; Antonella Marte; Zeila Casiraghi; Paola Marciani; Felix von Zweydorf; Christian Johannes Gloeckner; Franco Onofri; Carla Perego; Giovanni Piccoli,Cell biology; Neuroscience,"Department of Excellence of Pharmacological and Biomolecular Sciences Universita degli Studi di Milano, Milano, Italy; CIBIO, Universita degli Studi di Trento, Italy  Dulbecco Telethon Institute, Trento, Italy; Facultad de Farmacia, Universidad CEU San Pablo, Madrid, Spain; CIBIO, Universita degli Studi di Trento, Italy  Dulbecco Telethon Institute, Trento, Italy; Department of Experimental Medicine, University of Genova, Genova, Italy; IRCCS Ospedale Policlinico San Martino, Genova, Italy; Department of Excellence of Pharmacological and Biomolecular Sciences Universita degli Studi di Milano, Milano, Italy; Department of Excellence of Pharmacological and Biomolecular Sciences Universita degli Studi di Milano, Milano, Italy; German Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases (DZNE), Tubingen, Germany; German Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases (DZNE), Tubingen, Germany; University of Tubingen, Center for Ophthalmology, Institute for Ophthalmic Research, Tubingen, Germany; Department of Experimental Medicine, University of Genova, Genova, Italy; IRCCS Ospedale Policlinico San Martino, Genova, Italy; Department of Excellence of Pharmacological and Biomolecular Sciences Universita degli Studi di Milano, Milano, Italy; CIBIO, Universita degli Studi di Trento, Italy  Dulbecco Telethon Institute, Trento, Italy"

Although feline mammary carcinoma is increasingly recognized as a valuable cancer model, no studies on CTLA4 function had been conducted in this species. The serum CTLA4, TNF and IL6 levels of 57 female cats with mammary carcinoma were determined by ELISA, and immunohistochemistry was performed to evaluate CTLA4 and FoxP3 expression in tumor cells and interstitial lymphocytes. The results obtained show that serum CTLA4 levels are increased in cats with mammary carcinoma (P  0.022), showing an association with a number of clinicopathological features: smaller tumor size, P  0.001; absence of tumor necrosis, P  0.001; nonbasal status, P  0.02 and HER2positive status. Additionally, a strong positive correlation was found between serum CTLA4 levels and serum TNF (R  0.88, P  0.001) and IL6 levels (R  0.72, P  0.001). Concerning the CTLA4 and FoxP3 expression, although detected in both interstitial lymphocytes and tumor cells, a positive association was found only between interstitial CTLA4 and FoxP3 expressions (R  0.387, P  0.01), which is negatively associated with the serum CTLA4 levels (P  0.03). These findings provide a preliminary step in the characterization of immune profiles in feline mammary carcinoma, uncovering a molecular rationale for targeted therapy with CTLA4 pathway inhibitors. Finally, by strengthening the hypothesis of an immunomodulatory role for this regulator, we further validate the utility of spontaneous feline mammary carcinoma as a model for human breast cancer.",Ana Catarina Urbano; Catarina Nascimento; Maria Soares; Jorge Correia; Fernando Ferreira,Biomarkers; Cancer; Oncology,"CIISA  Centro de Investigacao Interdisciplinar em Sanidade Animal, Faculdade de Medicina Veterinaria, Universidade de Lisboa, Avenida da Universidade Tecnica, Lisboa, Portugal; CIISA  Centro de Investigacao Interdisciplinar em Sanidade Animal, Faculdade de Medicina Veterinaria, Universidade de Lisboa, Avenida da Universidade Tecnica, Lisboa, Portugal; Research Center for Biosciences and Health Technologies (CBiOS), Faculdade de Medicina Veterinaria, Universidade Lusofona de Humanidades e Tecnologias (ULHT), Lisboa, Portugal; CIISA  Centro de Investigacao Interdisciplinar em Sanidade Animal, Faculdade de Medicina Veterinaria, Universidade de Lisboa, Avenida da Universidade Tecnica, Lisboa, Portugal; CIISA  Centro de Investigacao Interdisciplinar em Sanidade Animal, Faculdade de Medicina Veterinaria, Universidade de Lisboa, Avenida da Universidade Tecnica, Lisboa, Portugal"
21ec356fe364433bbd696cdb93a37e08,Exploring the role of the Ser9Gly (rs6280) Dopamine D3 receptor polymorphism in nicotine reinforcement and cueelicited craving,"Preclinical studies show that the dopamine D3 receptor (D3R) is involved in the reinstatement of drug seeking and motivation for drugs of abuse. A D3R gene variant, Ser9Gly (rs6280) has been linked to nicotine dependence, yet the mechanisms underlying its involvement in nicotine dependence is unclear. This study investigated the relationship between the Ser9Gly variant and measures of both nicotine reinforcement and cueelicited craving. Phenotypes of smoking behaviors were assessed in genetically grouped (Glycine vs. No Glycine carriers) current smokers (n  104,  10 cigarettes per day). Laboratory measures included a forced choice session (to measure reinforcement of nicotine containing vs. denicotinized cigarettes), and a cuereactivity session (to measure smoking cues vs. neutral cues elicited craving). The forced choice procedure revealed that subjective ratings were significantly higher in response to nicotinized compared to denicotinized cigarettes; however the Ser9Gly variant did not influence this effect. By comparison, smoking cues elicited greater craving over time compared to neutral cues, and Glycine carriers of the Ser9Gly D3R variant seem to experience a significant blunted cueelicited craving effect. Results support D3R involvement in nicotine cue reactivity. However, more research is needed to reveal how this gene variant modulates various aspects of nicotine dependence.",Chidera C.

Our results show that the Se defect is energetically more favorable than that of Pd defect. The band gap reduces, and some new midgap states appear after the Pd or Se defects are introduced. In terms of the optical properties, the prominent anisotropic characters are remained. The obvious new peaks of the dielectric constant appear after introducing defects. The light absorption in the visible energy range expands based on the appearance of the midgap states induced by the Pd or Se defects. The changes of the refractive index and reflectivity are similar with those of the dielectric constants and the light absorption. The energy loss spectrum of the PdSe2 with Pd or Se defects is obviously different, which can be used to identify different defects in PdSe2.

Infectious carriers are not always symptomatic, meaning there is a risk to nonenzootic areas. Regulatory tests for EP include seroepidemiological methods for equine babesiosis, but these lack specificity due to crossreactivity with other Babesia species. In this study, we present a realtime quantitative recombinase polymerase amplification (qRPA) method for fast simultaneous detection of both T. equi and B. caballi. In this method, primers and probes targeting the 18S rRNA gene of both T. equi and B. caballi, the ema1 gene of T. equi and the bc48 gene of B. caballi were designed and evaluated. The sensitivity of qRPA was evaluated using the pUC57 plasmid DNA containing the target gene. For the pUC57bc48 gene DNA, the R2 value was 0.983 for the concentration range 0.2 ng (4.1  107 DNA copies) to 2.0 fg (4.1  101 DNA copies). For the pUC57ema gene DNA, the R2 value was 0.993 for the concentration range 0.2 ng (5.26  107 DNA copies) to 2.0 fg (5.26  102 DNA copies). For the pUC57Bc18S gene DNA the R2 value was 0.976 for the concentration range 2.0 ng (4.21  108 DNA copies) to 2.0 fg (4.21  102 DNA copies). For the pUC57Te18S gene DNA, the R2 value was 0.952 (Fig. S3b) for the concentration range 2.0 ng (4.16  108 DNA copies) to 2.0 fg (4.16  102 DNA copies). Furthermore, a duplex qRPA analysis was developed and optimized and the results showed that primers and probes targeting for the bc48 gene of B. caballi and the 18S rRNA gene of T. equi is the best combination for a duplex qRPA analysis in one reaction. The developed duplex qRPA assay has good specificity, and had negative amplification for several similar parasite. For DNA extracted from real horse blood specimens, this qRPA method has comparable sensitivity to traditional qPCR, but a simpler and more rapid operating process to obtain positive amplification. The qRPA, including the duplex strategy described here, could allow fast identification of the EPcausing T. equi and B. caballi, showing great potential for onsite EP screening of horses.",Rong Lei; Xinyi Wang; Di Zhang; Yize Liu; Qijun Chen; Ning Jiang,Microbiology; Molecular biology,"Chinese Academy of Inspection and Quarantine, Beijing, China; Key Laboratory of Livestock Infectious Diseases in Northeast China, Ministry of Education, Key Laboratory of Zoonosis, Shenyang Agricultural University, Shenyang, China; College of Land and Environment, Shenyang Agricultural University, Shenyang, China; College of Land and Environment, Shenyang Agricultural University, Shenyang, China; Key Laboratory of Livestock Infectious Diseases in Northeast China, Ministry of Education, Key Laboratory of Zoonosis, Shenyang Agricultural University, Shenyang, China; The Research Unit for Pathogenic Mechanisms of Zoonotic Parasites, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Shenyang, China; Key Laboratory of Livestock Infectious Diseases in Northeast China, Ministry of Education, Key Laboratory of Zoonosis, Shenyang Agricultural University, Shenyang, China; The Research Unit for Pathogenic Mechanisms of Zoonotic Parasites, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Shenyang, China; Key Laboratory of Livestock Infectious Diseases in Northeast China, Ministry of Education, Key Laboratory of Zoonosis, Shenyang Agricultural University, Shenyang, China; The Research Unit for Pathogenic Mechanisms of Zoonotic Parasites, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Shenyang, China"

As microRNA494 (miR494) protects against breast cancer progression, we investigated whether miR494 is involved in the regulation of TFPI2 in MCF7 breast cancer cells. TFPI2 mRNA and protein levels increased after transfection with miR494 mimic, and TFPI2 mRNA and miR494 levels correlated positively in tumors from breast cancer patients. No specific binding sites for miR494 in the 3untranslated region (UTR) of TFPI2 were identified; however, miR494 was predicted in silico to bind 3UTR of the transcription factors AHR and ELF1, which have potential binding sites in the TFPI2 promoter. ELF1 mRNA was downregulated whereas AHR mRNA levels were upregulated after transfection with miR494 mimic. Knockdown of ELF1 and AHR increased and reduced TFPI2 mRNA levels, respectively. Increased luciferase activity was seen when TFPI2 promoter constructs containing the potential AHR or ELF1 binding sites were cotransfected with miR494 mimic. In conclusion, TFPI2 mRNA levels were upregulated by miR494 in MCF7 breast cancer cells most likely by an indirect association where miR494 targeted the transcription factors AHR and ELF1.

ac922ed6406446ab8e6035c97353eb08,Longrange replica exchange molecular dynamics guided drug repurposing against tyrosine kinase PtkA of Mycobacterium tuberculosis,"Tuberculosis (TB) is a leading cause of death worldwide and its impact has intensified due to the emergence of multi drugresistant (MDR) and extensively drugresistant (XDR) TB strains. Protein phosphorylation plays a vital role in the virulence of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M.tb) mediated by protein kinases. Protein tyrosine phosphatase A (MptpA) undergoes phosphorylation by a unique tyrosinespecific kinase, protein tyrosine kinase A (PtkA), identified in the M.tb genome. PtkA phosphorylates PtpA on the tyrosine residues at positions 128 and 129, thereby increasing PtpA activity and promoting pathogenicity of MptpA. In the present study, we performed an extensive investigation of the conformational behavior of the intrinsically disordered domain (IDD) of PtkA using replica exchange molecular dynamics simulations. Longterm molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were performed to elucidate the role of IDD on the catalytic activity of kinase core domain (KCD) of PtkA. This was followed by identification of the probable inhibitors of PtkA using drug repurposing to block the PtpAPtkA interaction. The inhibitory role of IDD on KCD has already been established; however, various analyses conducted in the present study showed that IDDPtkA had a greater inhibitory effect on the catalytic activity of KCDPtkA in the presence of the drugs esculin and inosine pranobex.

The interconnected osteocyte system is deeply embedded inside the mineralized bone matrix and lies within a closely fitted porosity known as the lacunocanalicular network. However, quantitative data on human samples remain scarce, mostly measured in 2D, and there are gaps to be filled in terms of spatial resolution. In this work, we present data on femoral samples from female donors imaged with isotropic 3D spatial resolution by magnified Xray phase nano computerizedtomography. We report quantitative results on the 3D structure of canaliculi in human femoral bone imaged with a voxel size of 30 nm. We found that the lacunocanalicular porosity occupies on average 1.45% of the total tissue volume, the ratio of the canalicular versus lacunar porosity is about 37.7%, and the primary number of canaliculi stemming from each lacuna is 79 on average. The examination of this number at different distances from the surface of the lacunae demonstrates branching in the canaliculi network. We analyzed the impact of spatial resolution on quantification by comparing parameters extracted from the same samples imaged with 120 nm and 30 nm voxel sizes. To avoid any bias related to the analysis region, the volumes at 120 nm and 30 nm were registered and cropped to the same field of view. Our results show that the measurements at 120 and 30 nm are strongly correlated in our data set but that the highest spatial resolution provides more accurate information on the canaliculi network and its branching properties.",Boliang Yu; Alexandra Pacureanu; Cecile Olivier; Peter Cloetens; Francoise Peyrin,Bone imaging; Computed tomography,"Univ Lyon, INSA Lyon, Universite Claude Bernard Lyon 1, UJMSaint Etienne, CNRS UMR 5220, Inserm U1206, CREATIS, Lyon, France; ESRF, the European Synchrotron, Grenoble, France; Univ Lyon, INSA Lyon, Universite Claude Bernard Lyon 1, UJMSaint Etienne, CNRS UMR 5220, Inserm U1206, CREATIS, Lyon, France; ESRF, the European Synchrotron, Grenoble, France; ESRF, the European Synchrotron, Grenoble, France; Univ Lyon, INSA Lyon, Universite Claude Bernard Lyon 1, UJMSaint Etienne, CNRS UMR 5220, Inserm U1206, CREATIS, Lyon, France; ESRF, the European Synchrotron, Grenoble, France"

Sphingolipids (SPLs) are the largest class of bioactive lipids associated to various aspects of tumorigenesis and have been extensively studied in cancer cell lines and experimental models. The clinical relevance of SPLs in human malignancies however is still poorly understood and needs further investigation. In the present study, we adopted a UHPLCHigh resolution (orbitrap) Mass spectrometry (HRMS) approach to identify various sphingolipid species in breast cancer patients. A total of 49 SPLs falling into 6 subcategories have been identified. Further, integrating the multivariate analysis with metabolomics enabled us to identify an elevation in the levels of ceramide phosphates and sphingosine phosphates in tumor tissues as compared to adjacent normal tissues. The expression of genes involved in the synthesis of reported metabolites was also determined in local as well as TCGA cohort. A significant upregulation in the expression of CERK and SPHK1 was observed in tumor tissues in local and TCGA cohort. Sphingomyelin levels were found to be high in adjacent normal tissues. Consistent with the above findings, expression of SGMS1 in tumor tissues was downregulated in TCGA cohort only. Clinical correlations of the selected metabolites and their performance as biomarkers was also evaluated. Significant ROC and positive correlation with Ki67 index highlight the diagnostic potential and clinical relevance of ceramide phosphates in breast cancer.",Priyanka Bhadwal; Divya Dahiya; Dhananjay Shinde; Kim Vaiphei; Raviswamy G.

We developed an algorithm based on artificial vision and machine learning (and other classifiers) that predicts pregnancy using the beta human chorionic gonadotropin (bhCG) test from both the morphology of an embryo and the age of the patients. We employed two highquality databases with known pregnancy outcomes (n  221). We created a system consisting of different classifiers that is feed with novel morphometric features extracted from the digital micrographs, along with other nonmorphometric data to predict pregnancy. It was evaluated using five different classifiers: probabilistic bayesian, Support Vector Machines (SVM), deep neural network, decision tree, and Random Forest (RF), using a kfold cross validation to assess the model's generalization capabilities. In the database A, the SVM classifier achieved an F1 score of 0.74, and AUC of 0.77. In the database B the RF classifier obtained a F1 score of 0.71, and AUC of 0.75. Our results suggest that the system is able to predict a positive pregnancy test from a single digital image, offering a novel approach with the advantages of using a small database, being highly adaptable to different laboratory settings, and easy integration into clinical practice.",Alejandro ChavezBadiola; Adolfo FloresSaiffe Farias; Gerardo MendizabalRuiz; Rodolfo GarciaSanchez; Andrew J.

The strength of Reelin signaling is regulated by proteolytic processing, but its importance in vivo is not yet fully understood. Here, we generated Reelin knockin (PADV KI) mice in which the key cleavage site of Reelin was abolished by mutation. As expected, the cleavage of Reelin was severely abrogated in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus of PADV KI mice. The amount of Dab1, whose degradation is induced by Reelin signaling, decreased in these tissues, indicating that the signaling strength of Reelin was augmented. The brains of PADV KI mice were largely structurally normal, but unexpectedly, the hippocampal layer was disturbed. This phenotype was ameliorated in hemizygote PADV KI mice, indicating that excess Reelin signaling is detrimental to hippocampal layer formation. The neuronal dendrites of PADV KI mice had more branches and were elongated compared to wildtype mice. These results present the first direct evidence of the physiological importance of Reelin cleavage.",Eisuke Okugawa; Himari Ogino; Tomofumi Shigenobu; Yuko Yamakage; Hitomi Tsuiji; Hisashi Oishi; Takao Kohno; Mitsuharu Hattori,Biochemistry; Biophysical chemistry; Development of the nervous system; Neuroscience,"Department of Biomedical Science, Graduate School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Nagoya City University, Nagoya, Japan; Department of Biomedical Science, Graduate School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Nagoya City University, Nagoya, Japan; Department of Biomedical Science, Graduate School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Nagoya City University, Nagoya, Japan; Department of Biomedical Science, Graduate School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Nagoya City University, Nagoya, Japan; Department of Biomedical Science, Graduate School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Nagoya City University, Nagoya, Japan; Department of Comparative and Experimental Medicine, Graduate School of Medical Sciences, Nagoya City University, Nagoya, Japan; Department of Biomedical Science, Graduate School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Nagoya City University, Nagoya, Japan; Department of Biomedical Science, Graduate School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Nagoya City University, Nagoya, Japan"

Eightynine highly myopic eyes were included in this study. Bruch's membrane opening (BMO) area, lamina cribrosa (LC) thickness, anterior laminar depth, peripapillary and subfoveal choroidal thickness (CT), macular Bruch's membrane (BM) length, and width of PPA with and without Bruch's membrane (PPABM and PPABM) were evaluated. The mean age and axial length of the included subjects were 26.88  2.44 years and 27.03  0.88 mm, respectively. The width of PPABM was larger with increasing BMO area (P  0.001), whereas the BMO area was not associated with the width of PPABM. The large PPABM was significantly related to a thinner LC (P  0.003), deeper anterior lamina surface (P  0.001), longer macular BM length (P  0.008), and thinner temporal peripapillary CT (P  0.034).

Therefore, we aim to evaluate the prevalence of genital HPV infection among adolescents and young adults in Brazil. A crosssectional, multicentric, nationwide survey was conducted between September 2016 and November 2017. Sexually active unvaccinated women and men aged 16 to 25 years old were recruited from 119 public primary care units, including all 26 state capitals and the Federal District. All participants answered a facetoface interview and provided biological samples for genital HPV analysis. We used an automated DNA extraction method and HPV genotyping was performed using the Linear Array genotyping test (Roche). Of 7,694 participants, 53.6% (95% CI 51.455.8) were positive for any HPV type. The prevalence of highrisk HPV types was significantly higher in women (38.6% vs. 29.2%, P  0001). The HPV types included in the quadrivalent vaccine were detected in 1002 (14.8%) specimens, with a different pattern of HPV infection between sexes. Characteristics associated with overall HPV detection included female gender, selfdeclaration of race as brownpardo, lower socioeconomic class, single or dating, current smoking and having 2 or more sex partners in the past year.

To investigate emergent largescale, longterm interactions between soil moisture and other key hydroclimatic variables (precipitation, actual evapotranspiration, runoff, temperature), we analyze monthly values and anomalies of these variables in 1378 hydrological catchments across Europe over the period 19802010. The study distinguishes results for the main European climate regions, and tests how sensitive or robust they are to the use of three alternative observational and reanalysis datasets. Robustly across the European climates and datasets, monthly soil moisture anomalies correlate well with runoff anomalies, and extreme soil moisture and runoff values also largely cooccur. For precipitation, evapotranspiration, and temperature, anomaly correlation and extreme value cooccurrence with soil moisture are overall lower than for runoff.

We investigated the poorly understood Ca2NFAT regulation of coronary artery endothelial cells and consequent dysfunction in KD pathogenesis. Human coronary artery endothelial cells (HCAECs) stimulated with sera from patients with KD, compared with sera from healthy children, exhibited significant increases in proliferation and angiogenesis, higher levels of NFATc1 and NFATc3 and some inflammatory molecules, and increased nuclear translocation of NFATc1 and NFATc3. HCAECs stimulated with sera from patients with KD treated with cyclosporine A (CsA) showed decreased proliferation, angiogenesis, NFATc1 and inflammatory molecules levels as compared with results for untreated HCAECs. In conclusion, our data reveal that KD sera activate the Ca2NFAT in HCAECs, leading to dysfunction and inflammation of endothelial cells.

We employed a MRONJlike rat model to investigate whether injecting fluvastatin at extraction sites prevents MRONJlike lesion. A MRONJlike model was created by treating rats with zoledronate and dexamethasone, extracting teeth, and immediately injecting fluvastatin at the extraction site. The experimental group comprised three subgroups treated with low (0.1 mgkg; FSL), medium (1.0 mgkg; FSM) and high concentrations (10 mgkg; FSH) of fluvastatin. Necrotic bone exposure was significantly lower in the FSM (p  0.028) and FSH (p  0.041) groups than in the MRONJ group. The distance between the edges of the epithelial surfaces was significantly shorter in the FSM (p  0.042) and FSH (p  0.041) groups. The area of necrotic bone and the necrotic bone ratio were significantly smaller in the FSH group (p  0.041 and p  0.042 respectively). Bone volume fraction calculated on CT images was significantly larger in the FSH group than in the MRONJ group (p  0.021).

One of them is the Philippines, which is crucial to unravel the colonization of Southeast Asia and Oceania but where little is known about when and how the first humans arrived. In order to shed light into this settlement, we collected samples from 157 individuals of the Philippines with the four grandparents belonging to the same region and mitochondrial variants older than 20,000 years. Next, we analyzed the hypervariable I mtDNA region by approximate Bayesian computation based on extensive spatially explicit computer simulations to select among several migration routes towards the Philippines and to estimate population genetic parameters of this colonization. We found that the colonization of the Philippines occurred more than 60,000 years ago, with longdistance dispersal and from both north and south migration routes. Our results also suggest an environmental scenario especially optimal for humans, with large carrying capacity and population growth, in comparison to other regions of Asia.

The histomorphometric study included human globes enucleated for reasons such as malignant uveal melanoma, endstage painful secondary angleclosure glaucoma and congenital glaucoma. BM thickness and RPE cell density were measured upon light microscopy. The investigation included 122 eyes (mean axial length: 26.7  3.7 mm; range: 20.037.0 mm): 7 eyes with SHM (axial length: 33.7  2.1 mm; range: 31.037.0 mm), 56 eyes with PHM (mean axial length: 29.1  2.4 mm; range: 26.036.0 mm) and 59 eyes in the NHMgroup (axial length: 23.5  1.3 mm; range: 20.025.5 mm). In the SHM group, longer axial length was associated with lower RPE cell density at the posterior pole (standardized regression coefficient beta: 0.92; non standardized regression coefficient B: 2.76; 95% confidence interval (CI): 4.41, 1.10;P  0.01), at the midpoint posterior poleequator (beta: 0.87; B: 3.60; 95% CI: 6.48, 0.73;P  0.03), and at the equator (beta: 0.88; B: 0.95; 95% CI: 1.68, 0.23; P  0.02), but not at the ora serrata (P  0.88). In the PHMgroup and NHM group, RPE cell density at the posterior pole (P  0.08) and ora serrata (P  0.88) was statistically independent of axial length, while at the midpoint posterior poleequator (P  0.01) and equator (P  0.001), RPE cell density decreased with longer axis. BM thickness in the SHM group decreased with longer axial length at the posterior pole (beta: 0.93;B: 0.29; 95% CI: 0.39, 0.14; P  0.003), midpoint posterior poleequator (beta: 0.79; B: 0.22; 95% CI: 0.42, 0.02; P  0.035) and equator (beta: 0.84; B: 0.21; 95% CI: 0.37, 0.06; P  0.017), while in the PHMgroup and NHMgroup, BM thickness at any ocular region was not statistically significantly correlated with axial length (all P  0.05). In the SHMgroup, but not in the PHMgroup or NHMgroup (P  0.98), lower BM thickness was associated with lower RPE cell density (beta: 0.93; B: 0.09; 95% CI: 0.04, 0.14; P  0.007), while in the eyes without congenital glaucoma the relationship was not statistically significant.

a079ca277858419d885ed3da3e4c6b30,Role of cyclindependent kinase 2 in the progression of mouse juvenile cystic kidney disease,"A hallmark of polycystic kidney diseases (PKDs) is aberrant proliferation, which leads to the formation and growth of renal cysts. Proliferation is mediated by cyclindependent kinases (Cdks), and the administration of roscovitine (a panCdk inhibitor) attenuates renal cystic disease in juvenile cystic kidney (jck) mice. Cdk2 is a key regulator of cell proliferation, but its specific role in PKD remains unknown. The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that Cdk2 deficiency reduces renal cyst growth in PKD. Three studies were undertaken: (i) a time course (days 28, 56, and 84) of cyclin and Cdk activity was examined in jck mice and compared with wildtype mice; (ii) the progression was compared in jck mice with or without Cdk2 ablation from birth; and (iii) the effect of sirolimus (an antiproliferative agent) on Cdk2 activity in jck mice was investigated. Renal disease in jck mice was characterized by diffuse tubular cyst growth, interstitial inflammation and fibrosis, and renal impairment, peaking on day 84. Renal cell proliferation peaked during earlier stages of disease (days 2856), whereas the expression of Cdk2cyclin partners (A and E) and Cdk1 and 2 activity, was maximal in the later stages of disease (days 5684). Cdk2 ablation did not attenuate renal disease progression and was associated with persistent Cdk1 activity. In contrast, the postnatal treatment of jck mice with sirolimus reduced both Cdk2 and Cdk1 activity and reduced renal cyst growth. In conclusion, (i) the kinetics of Cdk2 and Cdk2cyclin partners did not correlate with proliferation in jck mice; and (ii) the absence of Cdk2 did not alter renal cyst growth, most likely due to compensation by Cdk1. Taken together, these data suggest that Cdk2 is dispensable for the proliferation of cystic epithelial cells and progression of PKD. Aberrant proliferation is a central hallmark of polycystic kidney diseases (PKDs) but the role of specific G1phase cyclindependent kinases (Cdks) is not clear. This study shows that the kinetics of Cdk2 and Cdk2cyclin partners do not correlate with proliferation and that the absence of Cdk2 does not alter renal cyst growth, most likely due to compensation by Cdk1. These findings therefore suggest that Cdk2 is not required for the progression of PKD.",Jennifer Qin Jing Zhang; Jane Burgess; Daria Stepanova; Sayanthooran Saravanabavan; Annette T. Y.

5dc5ca8d8a484496adfc1caa9ebcbf34,Spitz melanoma is a distinct subset of spitzoid melanoma,"Melanomas that have histopathologic features that overlap with those of Spitz nevus are referred to as spitzoid melanomas. However, the diagnostic concept is used inconsistently and genomic analyses suggest it is a heterogeneous category. Spitz tumors, the spectrum of melanocytic neoplasms extending from Spitz nevi to their malignant counterpart Spitz melanoma, are defined in the 2018 WHO classification of skin tumors by the presence of specific genetic alterations, such as kinase fusions or HRAS mutations. It is unclear what fraction of ""spitzoid melanomas"" defined solely by their histopathologic features belong to the category of Spitz melanoma or to other melanoma subtypes. We assembled a cohort of 25 spitzoid melanomas diagnosed at a single institution over an 8year period and performed highcoverage DNA sequencing of 480 cancer related genes. Transcriptome wide RNA sequencing was performed for select cases. Only nine cases (36%) had genetic alterations characteristic of Spitz melanoma, including HRAS mutation or fusion involving BRAF, ALK, NTRK1, or MAP3K8. The remaining cases were divided into those with an MAPK activating mutation and those without an MAPK activating mutation. Both Spitz melanoma and spitzoid melanomas in which an MAPKactivating mutation could not be identified tended to occur in younger patients on skin with little solar elastosis, infrequently harbored TERT promoter mutations, and had a lower burden of pathogenic mutations than spitzoid melanomas with nonSpitz MAPKactivating mutations. The MAPKactivating mutations identified affected nonV600 residues of BRAF as well as NRAS, MAP2K12, NF1, and KIT, while BRAF V600 mutations, the most common mutations in melanomas of the WHO lowCSD category, were entirely absent. While the ""spitzoid melanomas"" comprising our cohort were enriched for bona fide Spitz melanomas, the majority of melanomas fell outside of the genetically defined category of Spitz melanomas, indicating that histomorphology is an unreliable predictor of Spitz lineage.",Shyam S.

Two of these, JK136 and JK139, potently inhibited cell viability and migrationinvasion of GC cell lines, and mouse xenografts, diversely expressing RHOA. Moreover, JK136s binding affinity for RHOA was 140fold greater than Rhosin, a nonclinical RHOA inhibitor. Network analysis of JK136139 vs. Rhosin treatments indicated downregulation of the sphingosine1phosphate, as an emerging cancer metabolic pathway in cell migration and motility.

Many studies have questioned the stability in diagnosing of ADHD from childhood to adulthood, and the shared and distinct aberrant functional connectivities (FCs) between ADHDchild and ADHDadult remain unidentified. We aim to explore shared and distinct FC patterns in ADHDchild and ADHDadult, and further investigated the crosscohort predictability using the identified FCs. After investigating the ADHDdiscriminative FCs from healthy controls (HCs) in both child (34 ADHDchild, 28 HCs) and adult (112 ADHDadult,77 HCs) cohorts, we identified both shared and distinct aberrant FC patterns between cohorts and their association with clinical symptoms. Moreover, the crosscohort predictability using the identified FCs were tested. The ADHDHC classification accuracies were 84.4% and 81.0% for children and male adults, respectively. The ADHDdiscriminative FCs shared in children and adults lie in the intranetwork within default mode network (DMN) and the internetwork between DMN and ventral attention network, positively correlated with total scores of ADHD symptoms. Particularly, internetwork FC between somatomotor network and dorsal attention network was uniquely impaired in ADHDchild, positively correlated with hyperactivity index; whereas the aberrant internetwork FC between DMN and limbic network exhibited more adultspecific ADHD dysfunction. And their crosscohort predictions were 70.4% and 75.6% between each other.

Here, using CD2cre; mTORC1 Raptorff, and mTORC2 Rictorff mice (KO mice), we found that mTORC1, but not mTORC2, was required for the proliferation and survival of peripheral  T cells, especially V4  T cells. Moreover, mTORC1 was essential for both  T1 and  17 differentiation, whereas mTORC2 was required for  T17, but not for  1, differentiation. We further studied the underlying molecular mechanisms and found that depletion of mTORC1 resulted in the increased expression of SOCS1, which in turn suppressed the key transcription factor Eomes, consequentially reducing IFN production. Whereas the reduced glycolysis resulted in impaired  17 differentiation in Raptor KO  T cells. In contrast, mTORC2 potentiated  17 induction by suppressing mitochondrial ROS (mitoROS) production. Consistent with their cytokine production profiles, the Raptor KO  T cells lost their antitumor function both in vitro and in vivo, whereas both Raptor and Rictor KO mice were resistant to imiquimod (IMQ)induced psoriasislike skin pathogenesis.

Despite recently improved management of LSCC, chemotherapy resistance of patients remains a challenge. In this study, we identified that long noncoding RNA FOXD2AS1 regulates LSCC therapeutic resistance by augmenting LSCC stemness. LSCC chemotherapyresistant patients showed increased FOXD2AS1 expression compared with that in chemotherapysensitive patients, which predicted poor prognosis. Gain or lossoffunction experiments showed that upregulated FOXD2AS1 maintained cancer stemness, reducing the response to chemotherapy, while FOXD2AS1 downregulation had the opposite effects. FOXD2AS1 acted as a scaffold for STAT3 and PRMT5, promoting STAT3 transcriptional activity, which is essential to maintain cancer stemness and promote chemotherapeutic resistance. Interfering with FOXD2AS1 using short hairpin RNA rescued LSCC's chemotherapeutic sensitivity. Thus, FOXD2AS1 promotes LSCC chemotherapeutic resistance and is an upstream activator of STAT3, making FOXD2AS1 a potential therapeutic target to improve the chemotherapy effect in LSCC patients.",Rui Li; Shuwei Chen; Jiandong Zhan; Xinghua Li; Wenlin Liu; Xiaoli Sheng; Zhongming Lu; Rong Zhong; Liangsi Chen; Xiaoning Luo; Yameng Hu; Ying Ouyang; Tao Liu; Quan Zhang; Siyi Zhang,Cancer stem cells; Cancer therapeutic resistance; Head and neck cancer; Predictive markers,"Guangdong Provincial People's Hospital, Guangdong Academy of Medical Sciences, School of Medicine, South China University of Technology, Guangzhou, China; Department of Otorhinolaryngology, Guangdong Provincial People's Hospital  Guangdong Academy of Medical Sciences, Guangzhou, China; Department of Head and Neck Surgery, Sun Yatsen University Cancer Center, Guangzhou, China; State Key Laboratory of Oncology in South China, Guangzhou, China; Collaborative Innovation Center of Cancer Medicine, Guangzhou, China; Department of Otorhinolaryngology, Guangdong Provincial People's Hospital  Guangdong Academy of Medical Sciences, Guangzhou, China; Department of Radiotherapy, The Affiliated Yantai Yuhuangding Hospital of Qingdao University, Yantai, China; Department of Otorhinolaryngology, The Sixth Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University, Qingyuan People's Hospital, Guangzhou, China; Department of Otorhinolaryngology, Guangdong Provincial People's Hospital  Guangdong Academy of Medical Sciences, Guangzhou, China; Department of Otorhinolaryngology, Guangdong Provincial People's Hospital  Guangdong Academy of Medical Sciences, Guangzhou, China; Guangdong Provincial People's Hospital, Guangdong Academy of Medical Sciences, School of Medicine, South China University of Technology, Guangzhou, China; Department of Otorhinolaryngology, Guangdong Provincial People's Hospital  Guangdong Academy of Medical Sciences, Guangzhou, China; Department of Otorhinolaryngology, Guangdong Provincial People's Hospital  Guangdong Academy of Medical Sciences, Guangzhou, China; Department of Otorhinolaryngology, Guangdong Provincial People's Hospital  Guangdong Academy of Medical Sciences, Guangzhou, China; Department of Biochemistry, Zhongshan school of medicine, Sun Yatsen University, Guangzhou, China; Sun Yatsen University Cancer Centre, State Key Laboratory of Oncology in Southern China, Collaborative Innovation Centre for Cancer Medicine, Guangzhou, China; Guangdong Provincial People's Hospital, Guangdong Academy of Medical Sciences, School of Medicine, South China University of Technology, Guangzhou, China; Department of Otorhinolaryngology, Guangdong Provincial People's Hospital  Guangdong Academy of Medical Sciences, Guangzhou, China; Department of Head and Neck Surgery, Sun Yatsen University Cancer Center, Guangzhou, China; State Key Laboratory of Oncology in South China, Guangzhou, China; Collaborative Innovation Center of Cancer Medicine, Guangzhou, China; Guangdong Provincial People's Hospital, Guangdong Academy of Medical Sciences, School of Medicine, South China University of Technology, Guangzhou, China; Department of Otorhinolaryngology, Guangdong Provincial People's Hospital  Guangdong Academy of Medical Sciences, Guangzhou, China"

We have previously reported that TSP4 promotes local vascular inflammation in a mouse atherosclerosis model. A common variant of TSP4, P387TSP4, was associated with increased cardiovascular disease risk in human population studies. In a mouse atherosclerosis model, TSP4 had profound effect on accumulation of macrophages in lesions, which prompted us to examine its effects on macrophages in more detail. We examined the effects of A387TSP4 and P387TSP4 on mouse macrophages in cell culture and in vivo in the model of LPSinduced peritonitis. In tissues and in cell culture, TSP4 expression was associated with inflammation: TSP4 expression was upregulated in peritoneal tissues in LPSinduced peritonitis, and proinflammatory signals, INF, GMCSF, and LPS, induced TSP4 expression in macrophages in vivo and in cell culture. Deficiency in TSP4 in macrophages from Thbs4 mice reduced the expression of proinflammatory macrophage markers, suggesting that TSP4 facilitates macrophage differentiation into a proinflammatory phenotype. Expression of TSP4, especially more active P387TSP4, was associated with higher cellular apoptosis. Cultured macrophages displayed increased adhesion to TSP4 and reduced migration in presence of TSP4, and these responses were further increased with P387 variant. We concluded that TSP4 expression in macrophages increases their accumulation in tissues during the acute inflammatory process and supports macrophage differentiation into a proinflammatory phenotype. In a model of acute inflammation, TSP4 supports proinflammatory macrophage apoptosis, a response that is closely related to their proinflammatory activity and release of proinflammatory signals. P387TSP4 was found to be the more active form of TSP4 in all examined functions.",Mohammed Tanjimur Rahman; Santoshi Muppala; Jiahui Wu; Irene Krukovets; Dmitry Solovjev; Dmitriy Verbovetskiy; Chioma Obiako; Edward F.

Brown adipose tissue (BAT) is a mitochondriaenriched and antidiabetic tissue that turns excess energy into heat to maintain metabolic homeostasis. Here we report that the FXN knockinknockout (KIKO) mouse shows hyperlipidemia, reduced energy expenditure and insulin sensitivity, and elevated plasma leptin, recapitulating T2Dlike signatures. FXN deficiency leads to disrupted mitochondrial ultrastructure and oxygen consumption as well as lipid accumulation in BAT. Transcriptomic data highlights cold intolerance in association with ironmediated cell death (ferroptosis). Impaired PKAmediated lipolysis and expression of genes controlling mitochondrial metabolism, lipid catabolism and adipogenesis were observed in BAT of KIKO mice as well as in FXNdeficient T37i brown and primary adipocytes. Significant susceptibility to ferroptosis was observed in adipocyte precursors that showed increased lipid peroxidation and decreased glutathione peroxidase 4.

Previous studies have shown that global Cav1 deficiency affects lipid metabolism and hepatic steatosis. We aimed to analyze the consequences of hepatocytespecific Cav1 knockout under healthy conditions and upon nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) development. Male and female hepatocytespecific Cav1 knockout (HepCAV1ko) mice were fed a methioninecholine (MCD) deficient diet for 4 weeks. MCD feeding caused severe hepatic steatosis and slight fibrosis. In addition, liver function parameters, i.e., ALT, AST, and GLDH, were elevated, while cholesterol and glucose level were reduced upon MCD feeding. These differences were not affected by hepatocytespecific Cav1 knockout. Microarray analysis showed strong differences in gene expression profiles of livers from HepCAV1ko mice compared those of global Cav1 knockout animals. Pathway enrichment analysis identified that metabolic alterations were sexdimorphically regulated by hepatocytespecific CAV1. In male HepCAV1ko mice, metabolic pathways were suppressed in NAFLD, whereas in female knockout mice induced. Moreover, genderspecific transcription profiles were modulated in healthy animals.

The structure of the new compound hispidulactone F (1) was determined by extensive spectra analysis including HRESIMS, NMR (1H, 13C, 1H1H COSY, HSQC, and HMBC). Hispidulactone F (1) and hispidulactone B (2) were a pair of stereoisomers at C3, whereas 2 R, 4Rsonnerlactone (3) and 2 R, 4Ssonnerlactone (4) were another pair of stereoisomers at C4. The stereochemistries of the hydroxyl groups at C3 in 1 and 2, and at C4 in 3 and 4 were first determined by modified Mosher's reactions. Thus, the absolute configuration C3 in hispidulactone B (2) was not right in our previous report, and was rectified to be R.

This signal allows us to spatially map the geometry of the inner accretion flow1,2a region that cannot yet be spatially resolved by any telescopeand provides a direct measure of the black hole mass and spin. The reverberation timescale is set by the light travel path between the direct emission from a hot Xray corona and the reprocessed emission from the inner edge of the accretion disk36. However, there is an inherent degeneracy in the reverberation signal between black hole mass, inner disk radius and height of the illuminating corona above the disk. Here we use a long Xray observation of the highly variable active galaxy IRAS 132243809 to track the reverberation signal as the system evolves on timescales of a day7,8. With the inclusion of all the relativistic effects, modelling reveals that the height of the Xray corona increases with increasing luminosity, providing a dynamic view of the inner accretion region. This simultaneous modelling allows us to break the inherent degeneracies and obtain an independent timingbased estimate for the mass and spin of the black hole. The uncertainty on black hole mass is comparable to the leading optical reverberation method9, making Xray reverberation a powerful technique, particularly for sources with low optical variability10. Relativistic modelling of long Xray observations of a highly variable active galaxy reveals that the height of its Xray corona increases with increasing luminosity.

88b329702c7c4e459979f2cd8804e721,More green and less blue water in the Alps during warmer summers,"Climate change can reduce surfacewater supply by enhancing evapotranspiration in forested mountains, especially during heatwaves. We investigate this 'drought paradox' for the European Alps using a 1,212station database and hyperresolution ecohydrological simulations to quantify blue (runoff) and green (evapotranspiration) water fluxes. During the 2003 heatwave, evapotranspiration in large areas over the Alps was above average despite low precipitation, amplifying the runoff deficit by 32% in the most runoffproductive areas (1,3003,000 m above sea level). A 3 C air temperature increase could enhance annual evapotranspiration by up to 100 mm (45 mm on average), which would reduce annual runoff at a rate similar to a 3% precipitation decrease. This suggests that greenwater feedbackswhich are often poorly represented in largescale model simulationspose an additional threat to water resources, especially in dry summers. Despite uncertainty in the validation of the hyperresolution ecohydrological modelling with observations, this approach permits more realistic predictions of mountain region water availability. Mountain forest drought can paradoxically increase evapotranspiration (green water), helping vegetation at the expense of runoff (blue water). This is quantified for the 2003 event in the European Alps, highlighting underappreciated vulnerability of bluewater resources to future warmer summers.",Theodoros Mastrotheodoros; Christoforos Pappas; Peter Molnar; Paolo Burlando; Gabriele Manoli; Juraj Parajka; Riccardo Rigon; Borbala Szeles; Michele Bottazzi; Panagiotis Hadjidoukas; Simone Fatichi,Hydrology; Water resources,"ETH Zurich, Institute of Environmental Engineering, Zurich, Switzerland; Departement de geographie and Centre d'etudes nordiques, Universite de Montreal, Montreal, Canada; ETH Zurich, Institute of Environmental Engineering, Zurich, Switzerland; ETH Zurich, Institute of Environmental Engineering, Zurich, Switzerland; ETH Zurich, Institute of Environmental Engineering, Zurich, Switzerland; Department of Civil, Environmental and Geomatic Engineering, University College London, London, UK; Centre for Water Resource Systems, Vienna University of Technology, Vienna, Austria; Department of Civil, Environmental and Mechanical Engineering, DICAM, University of Trento, Trento, Italy; Centre for Water Resource Systems, Vienna University of Technology, Vienna, Austria; Department of Civil, Environmental and Mechanical Engineering, DICAM, University of Trento, Trento, Italy; IBM, Zurich Research Laboratory, Zurich, Switzerland; ETH Zurich, Institute of Environmental Engineering, Zurich, Switzerland"

However, global maps of nutrient limitation are still lacking. Here we examined global N and P limitation using the ratio of siteaveraged leaf N and P resorption efficiencies of the dominant species across 171 sites. We evaluated our predictions using a global database of N and Plimitation experiments based on nutrient additions at 106 and 53 sites, respectively. Globally, we found a shift from relative P to N limitation for both higher latitudes and precipitation seasonality and lower mean annual temperature, temperature seasonality, mean annual precipitation and soil clay fraction. Excluding cropland, urban and glacial areas, we estimate that 18% of the natural terrestrial land area is significantly limited by N, whereas 43% is relatively P limited. The remaining 39% of the natural terrestrial land area could be colimited by N and P or weakly limited by either nutrient alone. This work provides both a new framework for testing nutrient limitation and a benchmark of N and P limitation for models to constrain predictions of the terrestrial carbon sink.

Variants of the microglia receptor triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (TREM2) increase AD risk, and activation of diseaseassociated microglia (DAM) is dependent on TREM2 in mouse models of AD. We surveyed geneexpression changes associated with AD pathology and TREM2 in 5XFAD mice and in human AD by singlenucleus RNA sequencing. We confirmed the presence of Trem2dependent DAM and identified a previously undiscovered Serpina3nC4b reactive oligodendrocyte population in mice. Interestingly, remarkably different glial phenotypes were evident in human AD. Microglia signature was reminiscent of IRF8driven reactive microglia in peripheralnerve injury. Oligodendrocyte signatures suggested impaired axonal myelination and metabolic adaptation to neuronal degeneration. Astrocyte profiles indicated weakened metabolic coordination with neurons. Notably, the reactive phenotype of microglia was less evident in TREM2R47H and TREM2R62H carriers than in noncarriers, demonstrating a TREM2 requirement in both mouse and human AD, despite the marked speciesspecific differences. Singlenucleus RNA sequencing in a mouse model of A accumulation and postmortem brain tissue from people with Alzheimer's disease reveals substantial speciesspecific differences in transcriptional signatures, but both point to the contribution of glia and the importance of TREM2.",Yingyue Zhou; Wilbur M.

NCT02234934 and NCT01855685). The primary objectives were to assess the safety and evaluate the efficacy and stability of biochemical and functional reconstitution in the progeny of engrafted cells at 12 months. The secondary objectives included the evaluation of augmented immunity against bacterial and fungal infection, as well as assessment of hematopoietic stem cell transduction and engraftment. Two enrolled patients died within 3 months of treatment from preexisting comorbidities. At 12 months, six of the seven surviving patients demonstrated stable vector copy numbers (0.41.8 copies per neutrophil) and the persistence of 1646% oxidasepositive neutrophils. There was no molecular evidence of either clonal dysregulation or transgene silencing. Surviving patients have had no new CGDrelated infections, and six have been able to discontinue CGDrelated antibiotic prophylaxis. The primary objective was met in six of the nine patients at 12 months followup, suggesting that autologous gene therapy is a promising approach for CGD patients.

ce7621f0ccef4540b9ca96f10d2678be,Environmental market design for largescale marine conservation,"It is commonly agreed that marine conservation should expand considerably around the world. However, most countries have not yet implemented largescale notake Marine Protected Areas (MPAs). When a country closes a large fraction of its waters to fishing, it stands to lose a considerable level of fishery revenue. Although biodiversity and spillover fishing benefits may far exceed these losses, benefits from largescale MPAs typically accrue to other countries or to the high seas. Here, to overcome this dilemma, we simulate and test an international fisheries management scheme with transferable fishing rights that incentivizes, rather than hinders, largescale marine conservation. By combining a bioeconomic model of crosscountry trading of fishing rights with vessellevel tracking data before and after a largescale conservation action is implemented, we show that transferable fishing rights and a biomassbased allocation rule are pivotal to incentivize conservation under this marketbased setting. Our work focuses on the Vessel Day Scheme (VDS)an environmental market that is employed by the Parties to the Nauru Agreement (a group of nine Pacific Island nations) to manage their tuna fisheriesand areas in which largescale conservation interventions have taken place. Overall, these results provide a template for how to incentivize countries to engage in largescale marine conservation within a marketbased setting.

To answer this provocative question, we explore the potential of midrise urban buildings designed with engineered timber to provide longterm storage of carbon and to avoid the carbonintensive production of mineralbased construction materials. Increasing urbanization will lead to a significant expansion of buildings and related infrastructure, major sources of greenhouse gas emissions.

However, a benzenesulfonamide derivative and related compounds have been shown recently to block infection of a range of enteroviruses by binding the capsid at a positivelycharged surface depression conserved across many enteroviruses. It has also been established that glutathione is essential for the assembly of many enteroviruses, interacting with the capsid proteins to facilitate the formation of the pentameric assembly intermediate, although the mechanism is unknown. Here we show, by high resolution structure analyses of enterovirus F3, that reduced glutathione binds to the same interprotomer pocket as the benzenesulfonamide derivative. Bound glutathione makes strong interactions with adjacent protomers, thereby explaining the underlying biological role of this druggable binding pocket and delineating the pharmacophore for potential antivirals. Helen Duyvesteyn et al. present a highresolution structural analysis of gluthathione binding to an enterovirus capsid.

This phenomenon, known as the Warburg effect, is critical for tumor development. However, how cancer cells coordinate glucose metabolism through glycolysis and the mitochondrial tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle is largely unknown. We demonstrate here that phosphoglycerate kinase 1 (PGK1), the first ATPproducing enzyme in glycolysis, is reversibly and dynamically modified with Olinked Nacetylglucosamine (OGlcNAc) at threonine 255 (T255). OGlcNAcylation activates PGK1 activity to enhance lactate production, and simultaneously induces PGK1 translocation into mitochondria. Inside mitochondria, PGK1 acts as a kinase to inhibit pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) complex to reduce oxidative phosphorylation. Blocking T255 OGlcNAcylation of PGK1 decreases colon cancer cell proliferation, suppresses glycolysis, enhances the TCA cycle, and inhibits tumor growth in xenograft models. Furthermore, PGK1 OGlcNAcylation levels are elevated in human colon cancers. This study highlights OGlcNAcylation as an important signal for coordinating glycolysis and the TCA cycle to promote tumorigenesis. Posttranslational modifications of phosphoglycerate kinase 1 (PGK1), a glycoytic enzyme, contribute to cancer progression. Here, the authors show that PGK1 is OGlcNAcylated at T255, which induces its translocation into mitochondria to suppress the tricarboxylic acid cycle for colorectal cancer growth.",Hao Nie; Haixing Ju; Jiayi Fan; Xiaoliu Shi; Yaxian Cheng; Xiaohui Cang; Zhiguo Zheng; Xiaotao Duan; Wen Yi,Cancer metabolism; Glycobiology,"MOE Key Laboratory of Biosystems Homeostasis  Protection, College of Life Sciences; The First Affiliated Hospital, School of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China; Department of Colorectal Surgery, Zhejiang Cancer Hospital, Hangzhou, China; MOE Key Laboratory of Biosystems Homeostasis  Protection, College of Life Sciences; The First Affiliated Hospital, School of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China; MOE Key Laboratory of Biosystems Homeostasis  Protection, College of Life Sciences; The First Affiliated Hospital, School of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China; MOE Key Laboratory of Biosystems Homeostasis  Protection, College of Life Sciences; The First Affiliated Hospital, School of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China; Division of Medical Genetics and Genomics, The Children's Hospital, School of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China; Department of Colorectal Surgery, Zhejiang Cancer Hospital, Hangzhou, China; State Key Laboratory of Toxicology and Medical Countermeasures, Beijing Institute of Pharmacology and Toxicology, Beijing, China; MOE Key Laboratory of Biosystems Homeostasis  Protection, College of Life Sciences; The First Affiliated Hospital, School of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China"

It is, however, unclear how individual sensitivity to pain is reflected in the painfree restingstate brain activity and functional connectivity. Here, we identify and validate a network pattern in the painfree restingstate functional brain connectome that is predictive of interindividual differences in pain sensitivity. Our predictive network signature allows assessing the individual sensitivity to pain without applying any painful stimulation, as might be valuable in patients where reliable behavioural pain reports cannot be obtained. Additionally, as a direct, noninvasive readout of the supraspinal neural contribution to pain sensitivity, it may have implications for translational research and the development and assessment of analgesic treatment strategies. An fMRIbased brain signature to predict an individual's pain sensitivity could be useful clinically. Here the authors identify a network in the resting brain which can be used to predict responses to noxious stimuli in healthy subjects.",Tamas Spisak; Balint Kincses; Frederik Schlitt; Matthias Zunhammer; Tobias SchmidtWilcke; Zsigmond T.

8579fbe6184c48b1aa133c234310dd87,Ocean Carbon Storage across the middle Miocene: a new interpretation for the Monterey Event,"The Miocene Climatic Optimum (MCO, 1417 Ma) was ~34 C warmer than present, similar to estimates for 2100. Coincident with the MCO is the Monterey positive carbon isotope (13C) excursion, with oceans more depleted in 12C relative to 13C than any time in the past 50 Myrs. The longstanding Monterey Hypothesis uses this excursion to invoke massive marine organic carbon burial and drawdown of atmospheric CO2 as a cause for the subsequent Miocene Climate Transition and Antarctic glaciation. However, this hypothesis cannot explain the multiMyr lag between the 13C excursion and global cooling. We use planktic foraminiferal BCa, 11B, 13C, and MgCa to reconstruct surface ocean carbonate chemistry and temperature. We propose that the MCO was associated with elevated oceanic dissolved inorganic carbon caused by volcanic degassing, global warming, and sealevel rise. A key negative feedback of this warm climate was the organic carbon burial on drowned continental shelves. In this study, the authors use planktic foraminiferal data to reconstruct ocean carbonate chemistry and temperature from 16.5 to 11 Ma from a size in the tropical eastern Indian Ocean to look at the causes of the Monterey Excursion (ME). They find a positive relationship between dissolved inorganic (DIC) carbon and the ME and a negative one for DIC and the carbon maxima events.",S. M. Sosdian; T. L. Babila; R. Greenop; G. L.

e0771fd7965a4b5db5c1537712f4dbe5,An in vitro platform for engineering and harnessing modular polyketide synthases,"To harness the synthetic power of modular polyketide synthases (PKSs), many aspects of their biochemistry must be elucidated. A robust platform to study these megadalton assembly lines has not yet been described. Here, we in vitro reconstitute the venemycin PKS, a short assembly line that generates an aromatic product. Incubating its polypeptides, VemG and VemH, with 3,5dihydroxybenzoic acid, ATP, malonate, coenzyme A, and the malonylCoA ligase MatB, venemycin production can be monitored by HPLC and NMR. Multimilligram quantities of venemycin are isolable from dialysisbased reactors without chromatography, and the enzymes can be recycled. Assembly line engineering is performed using pikromycin modules, with synthases designed using the updated module boundaries outperforming those using the traditional module boundaries by over an order of magnitude. Using combinations of VemG, VemH, and their engineered derivatives, as well as the alternate starter unit 3hydroxybenzoic acid, a combinatorial library of six polyketide products is readily accessed. A robust platform to study modular polyketide synthases (PKSs) in vitro is still unavailable. Here, the authors report the reconstitution of the venemycin PKS, engineer hybrid venemycinpikromycin PKSs, and obtain much improved yields through employing the updated module boundaries.",Takeshi Miyazawa; Melissa Hirsch; Zhicheng Zhang; Adrian T.

Here, we show the HSC gene expression program is biased toward myelopoiesis and differentiation skewed toward granulocytemonocyte progenitors (GMP) during joint and intestinal inflammation in experimental spondyloarthritis (SpA). GMCSFreceptor is increased on HSCs and multipotent progenitors, favoring a striking increase in myelopoiesis at the earliest hematopoietic stages. GMP accumulate in the BM in SpA and, unexpectedly, at extramedullary sites: in the inflamed joints and spleen. Furthermore, we show that GMCSF promotes extramedullary myelopoiesis, tissuetoxic neutrophil accumulation in target organs, and GMCSF prophylactic or therapeutic blockade substantially decreases SpA severity. Surprisingly, besides CD4 T cells and innate lymphoid cells, mast cells are a source of GMCSF in this model, and its pathogenic production is promoted by the alarmin IL33. Spondyloarthritis pathology is manifested by increased myeloid infiltration of the joints. Here the authors show that in a mouse model of spondyloarthritis, a single dose of a microbial ligand curdlan induces persistent extramedullary myelopoiesis in the spleen and joints, which is driven by GMCSF and can be amplified by exogenous IL33.",Daniel ReganKomito; James W.

Here, we demonstrate the first observation on a synergistic effect caused by two neighboring Al centers interacting with the same silanol group in flamemade ASAs with high Al content. The two close Al centers decrease the electron density on the silanol oxygen and thereby enhance its acidity, which is comparable to that of dealuminated zeolites, while ASAs with small or moderate Al contents provide mainly moderate acidity, much lower than that of zeolites. The ASAs with enhanced acidity exhibit outstanding performances in CH bond activation of benzene and glucose dehydration to 5hydroxymethylfurfural, simultaneously with an excellent calcination stability and resistance to leaching, and they offer an interesting potential for a wide range of acid and multifunctional catalysis. Increasing the strength of silanols in silicaaluminas can promote their catalytic activity in various applications. Here, the authors present a synergistic effect of two neighboring Al sites on the same silanol group, which can enhance the strength of silanol proton from moderate to zeolitic strength.",Zichun Wang; Tong Li; Yijiao Jiang; Olivier Lafon; Zongwen Liu; Julien Trebosc; Alfons Baiker; JeanPaul Amoureux; Jun Huang,Catalytic mechanisms; Chemical engineering; Heterogeneous catalysis,"Laboratory for Catalysis Engineering, School of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering  Sydney Nano Institute, The University of Sydney, Sydney, Australia; Department of Engineering, Macquarie University, Sydney, Australia; Institute for Materials  ZGH, RuhrUniversitat Bochum, Bochum, Germany; Department of Engineering, Macquarie University, Sydney, Australia; Univ.

Developing quality protein maize (QPM) by introgressing o2 modifiers (Mo2s) into the o2 mutant benefits millions of people in developing countries where maize is a primary protein source. Here, we report genome sequence and annotation of a South African QPM line K0326Y, which is assembled from singlemolecule, realtime shotgun sequencing reads collinear with an optical map. We achieve a N50 contig length of 7.7 million bases (Mb) directly from longread assembly, compared to those of 1.04 Mb for B73 and 1.48 Mb for Mo17. To characterize Mo2s, we map QTLs to chromosomes 1, 6, 7, and 9 using an F2 population derived from crossing K0326Y and W64Ao2. RNAseq analysis of QPM and o2 endosperms reveals a group of differentially expressed genes that coincide with Mo2 QTLs, suggesting a potential role in vitreous endosperm formation. The South African quality protein maize (QPM) cultivars have the desired high lysine content and kernel hardness due to o2 mutation and the introgression of modifiers of o2 (Mo2) QTLs, respectively.

Here, combining flow cytometry, immunohistochemistry and RNAsequencing on breast cancer samples, we identify four CancerAssociated Fibroblast (CAF) subpopulations in metastatic lymph nodes (LN). Two myofibroblastic subsets, CAFS1 and CAFS4, accumulate in LN and correlate with cancer cell invasion. By developing functional assays on primary cultures, we demonstrate that these subsets promote metastasis through distinct functions. While CAFS1 stimulate cancer cell migration and initiate an epithelialtomesenchymal transition through CXCL12 and TGF pathways, highly contractile CAFS4 induce cancer cell invasion in 3dimensions via NOTCH signaling. Patients with high levels of CAFs, particularly CAFS4, in LN at diagnosis are prone to develop late distant metastases. Our findings suggest that CAF subset accumulation in LN is a prognostic marker, suggesting that CAF subsets could be examined in axillary LN at diagnosis.

The fundamental temperature fluctuations of the calorimeter, dictated by the coupling of it to the heat bath, set the ultimate lower bound of its energy resolution. Here we reach this limit of fundamental equilibrium fluctuations of temperature in a nanoscale electron calorimeter, exchanging energy with the phonon bath at very low temperatures. The approach allows noninvasive measurement of energy transport in superconducting quantum circuits in the microwave regime with high efficiency, opening the way, for instance, to observe quantum jumps, detecting their energy to tackle central questions in quantum thermodynamics. Quantum calorimeters can provide timeresolved measurement of single photons by converting them to detectable temperature changes.

00fd3c4bf66c41abb4f3b14d56b083b7,The potential of neurofilaments analysis using dryblood and plasma spots,"The lack of biomarkers for an early diagnosis of neurodegenerative disorders (NDs) has hampered the development of therapeutics whose effect would be enhanced by a timely intervention. Neurofilaments light chain (NfL), an integral part of the axonal structure, has emerged as a robust fluid biomarker for fatal neurodegenerative disorders like amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). To facilitate largescale studies into earlystage neurodegeneration, reduce costs of samples collectionprocessing and coldchain storage, we describe the measurement of NfL in blood fractions obtained from dry blood spots (DBS) and dry plasma spots (DPS), two filter paperbased remote blood collection tools. To test the feasibility of using this approach, NfL analysis in DBSDPS is compared to that in plasma obtained from the same blood sample, looking at NfL discriminatory power in the clinical stratification of ALS compared to healthy controls. With the best preanalytical treatment for total protein recovery and using highly sensitive immunoassays, we report the detection of different NfL levels in DBS elute compared to reference plasma and DPS from the same blood samples. However, NfL measurement in DBS elutes provides a very good discrimination of ALS from healthy controls which is comparable to that obtained using plasma NfL assays. With the available immunodetection methods, we show that NfL measurement based on DPS microsampling is similar to that in plasma. The filterpaper biophysical characteristics and the interference of high haemoglobin concentration released by erythrocyte lysis is likely to perturb NfL detection in DBS elute. Further studies into DBSbased NfL detection and its analytical optimization are needed to make this method suitable for routine NfL blood analyses in neurodegeneration.",Vittoria Lombardi; Daniele Carassiti; Gavin Giovannoni; ChingHua Lu; Rocco Adiutori; Andrea Malaspina,Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis; Prognostic markers,"Blizard Institute, Queen Mary, University of London, London, UK; Blizard Institute, Queen Mary, University of London, London, UK; Blizard Institute, Queen Mary, University of London, London, UK; School of Medicine, China Medical University, Taichung, Taiwan; Blizard Institute, Queen Mary, University of London, London, UK; Blizard Institute, Queen Mary, University of London, London, UK"

MSCs can, however, either promote or suppress tumor growth. To address the critical question of how MSCs loaded with oncolytic viruses affect virotherapy outcomes and tumor growth patterns in a tumor microenvironment, we developed and analyzed an integrated mathematicalexperimental model. We used the model to describe both the growth dynamics in our experiments of firefly luciferaseexpressing Hep3B tumor xenografts and the effects of the immune response during the MSCsbased virotherapy. We further employed it to explore the conceptual clinical feasibility, particularly, in evaluating the relative significance of potential immune promotivesuppressive mechanisms induced by MSCs loaded with oncolytic viruses. We were able to delineate conditions which may significantly contribute to the success or failure of MSCbased virotherapy as well as generate new hypotheses. In fact, one of the most impactful outcomes shown by this investigation, not inferred from the experiments alone, was the initially counterintuitive fact that using tumorpromoting MSCs as carriers is not only helpful but necessary in achieving tumor control. Considering the fact that it is still currently a controversial debate whether MSCs exert a pro or antitumor action, mathematical models such as this one help to quantitatively predict the consequences of using MSCs for delivering virotherapeutic agents in vivo. Taken together, our results show that MSCmediated systemic delivery of oncolytic viruses is a promising strategy for achieving synergistic antitumor efficacy with improved safety profiles.",Khaphetsi Joseph Mahasa; Lisette de Pillis; Rachid Ouifki; Amina Eladdadi; Philip Maini; ARum Yoon; ChaeOk Yun,Computational models; Stemcell research,"DSTNRF Centre of Excellence in Epidemiological Modelling and Analysis (SACEMA), University of Stellenbosch, Stellenbosch, South Africa; Department of Mathematics and Applied Mathematics, University of Pretoria, Pretoria, South Africa; Department of Mathematics, Harvey Mudd College, Claremont, USA; Department of Mathematics and Applied Mathematics, University of Pretoria, Pretoria, South Africa; Department of Mathematics, The College of Saint Rose, Albany, USA; Wolfson Centre for Mathematical Biology, Mathematical Institute, University of Oxford, Oxford, United Kingdom; Department of Bioengineering, College of Engineering, Hanyang University, Seoul, Republic of Korea; Department of Bioengineering, College of Engineering, Hanyang University, Seoul, Republic of Korea"

This paper investigates how rumors are amplified by a group of users who share similar interests or views, dubbed as an echo chamber. To this end, we identify and analyze 'rumor' echo chambers, each of which is a group of users who have participated in propagating common rumors. By collecting and analyzing 125 recent rumors from six popular factchecking sites, and their associated 289,202 tweetsretweets generated by 176,362 users, we find that the rumors that are spread by rumor echo chamber members tend to be more viral and quickly propagated than those that are not spread by echo chamber members. We propose the notion of an echo chamber network that represents relations among rumor echo chambers. By identifying the hub rumor echo chambers (in terms of connectivity to other rumor echo chambers) in the echo chamber network, we show that the top 10% of hub rumor echo chambers contribute to propagation of 24% rumors by eliciting more than 36% of retweets, implying that core rumor echo chambers significantly contribute to rumor spreads.","Daejin Choi; Selin Chun; Hyunchul Oh; Jinyoung Han; Ted ""Taekyoung"" Kwon",Applied physics; Environmental social sciences,"Georgia Institute of Technology, School of Interactive Computing, Atlanta, USA; Seoul National University, Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Seoul, Republic of Korea; Seoul National University, Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Seoul, Republic of Korea; Sungkyunkwan University, Department of Applied Artificial Intelligence, Seoul, Republic of Korea; Seoul National University, Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Seoul, Republic of Korea"

Three 3dimentional idealized models with different offsets were reconstructed by computeraided design to evaluate the effects of the selfpowered conduit. Furthermore, to validate the effects in patientspecific models, the conduit was introduced to three reconstructed models with different offsets. Results: The pressures at superior venae cavae and inferior venae cavae were decreased in both idealized models (0.4 mmHg) and patientspecific models (0.7 mmHg). In idealized models, the flows to left lungs were decreased (70%) by the jets from the conduits. However, in patientspecific models, the reductions of blood to the left lungs were relatively limited (30%) comparing to idealized models.

We measured the effect of CisPt on the levels of Dauno in different cell compartments, the effect of CisPt on Daunoinduced nucleosome eviction, and assessed the influence of Dauno on DNA platination in flow and laser scanning cytometry as well as in laser ablationinductively coupled plasmamass spectrometry assays. We show that the two drugs antagonize each other through a decrease of interstrand crosslinks upon cotreatment with Dauno, and also via the diminished Dauno uptake in the presence of CisPt, and both effects are observed already at low Dauno concentrations. At high Dauno concentrations synergy becomes dominant because histone eviction by Dauno intercalation into the DNA is enhanced in the presence of cotreatment with CisPt. These interactions may have an impact on the efficacy of combination treatment protocols, considering the long retention time of DNA adducts formed by both agents.",Erfaneh Firouzi Niaki; Thibaut Van Acker; Laszlo Imre; Peter Nanasi; Szabolcs Tarapcsak; Zsolt Bacso; Frank Vanhaecke; Gabor Szabo,Chemotherapy; Chromatin structure; Nucleosomes,"Department of Biophysics and Cell Biology, University of Debrecen, Faculty of Medicine, Debrecen, Hungary; Department of Chemistry, Atomic  Mass Spectrometry  AMS Research Unit, Ghent University, Campus Sterre, Ghent, Belgium; Department of Biophysics and Cell Biology, University of Debrecen, Faculty of Medicine, Debrecen, Hungary; Department of Biophysics and Cell Biology, University of Debrecen, Faculty of Medicine, Debrecen, Hungary; Department of Biophysics and Cell Biology, University of Debrecen, Faculty of Medicine, Debrecen, Hungary; Department of Biophysics and Cell Biology, University of Debrecen, Faculty of Medicine, Debrecen, Hungary; Department of Chemistry, Atomic  Mass Spectrometry  AMS Research Unit, Ghent University, Campus Sterre, Ghent, Belgium; Department of Biophysics and Cell Biology, University of Debrecen, Faculty of Medicine, Debrecen, Hungary"

Information relating to the comparison of flap monitoring techniques is lacking. Varying stenotic conditions (0%, 25%, 50%, 75% and 100%) were generated on purpose at the A. and V. femoralis in the rat model. Analyses included flowmeter, simultaneous laserDoppler flowmetry and tissue spectrophotometry (O2C) and indocyanine green (ICG) videoangiography with integrated FLOW 800 tool. A Random Forests prediction model was used to analyse the importance of each method to diagnose the stenotic conditions. The ability to discriminate and to accurately estimate the probability of stenosis was assessed by Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves and calibration plots. Blood flow changes for all modalities were described in detail. Flowmeter displayed earliest a linear decrease as a result of increasing stenosis. A stenosis of 50% degrees was most difficult to detect correctly. The combination of flowmeter and ICGvideoangiography showed high diagnostic power for each stenotic situation (area under the ROC  0.79). Flowmeter and ICGvideoangiography showed to be most relevant in detection of varying stenotic conditions and may change the clinical outcome. The O2C showed less effect on varying stenotic situations as the only surface monitoring device.",Thomas Mucke; Alexander Hapfelmeier; Leonard H. Schmidt; Andreas M.

It shows a gyromotion similarly to that of a charged particle under a magnetic field, being led to the transverse shift to the electric current, i.e., skyrmion Hall effect. With the open boundaries of a sample, this results in an accumulation of skyrmions on one side and their depletion on the other side. Here we demonstrate experimentally that this effect propagates nonlocally over tens of micrometers even where the electric current is absent, when the narrow wires bridge barshaped PtCoIr heterostructure thin film systems. This nonlocality can be understood in terms of the ""chemical potential"" gradient for the skyrmion bubble induced by the skyrmion Hall effect in the nonequilibrium steady state under the electric current. The present result shows that the skyrmion Hall effect acts as the skyrmion pump and the thermodynamic concepts can be applied to the aggregate of skyrmion bubbles.",Satoshi Sugimoto; Wataru Koshibae; Shinya Kasai; Naoki Ogawa; Yukiko Takahashi; Naoto Nagaosa; Yoshinori Tokura,Magnetic devices; Spintronics,"Research Center for Magnetic and Spintronic Materials, National Institute for Materials Science (NIMS), Tsukuba, Japan; RIKEN Center for Emergent Matter Science (CEMS), Wako, Japan; Research Center for Magnetic and Spintronic Materials, National Institute for Materials Science (NIMS), Tsukuba, Japan; JST, PRESTO, Kawaguchi, Japan; RIKEN Center for Emergent Matter Science (CEMS), Wako, Japan; JST, PRESTO, Kawaguchi, Japan; Research Center for Magnetic and Spintronic Materials, National Institute for Materials Science (NIMS), Tsukuba, Japan; RIKEN Center for Emergent Matter Science (CEMS), Wako, Japan; Department of Applied Physics, University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan; RIKEN Center for Emergent Matter Science (CEMS), Wako, Japan; Department of Applied Physics, University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan; Tokyo College, University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan"

Here, we investigated how instructions given prior to extinction training, with or without the additional removal of the electrode used to deliver the unconditioned stimulus (US), affect the return of fear assessed 24 hours later. We replicated previous instruction effects on extinction and added that the additional removal of the US electrode slightly enhanced facilitating effects on the extinction of conditioned FPSs. In contrast, extinction instructions hardly affected the return of conditioned fear responses. These findings suggest that instruction effects observed during extinction training do not extent to tests of return of fear 24 hours later which serve as laboratory models of relapse and improvement stability of exposurebased treatments.",Julia Wendt; Miriam C.

The food and pharmaceutical industries use it as a natural antioxygenic agent. Herein, a ~52 kDa protein, which is a major part of seed proteome has been purified, biochemically characterized and structure has been determined. MALDIESIMS identified peptide fragments and contigdeduced sequence suggested the protein to be homologous to 7S globulins. The crystal structure shows that protein has a bicupin fold similar to 7S globulins and the electron density for a copper and acetate ligand were observed in the Cterminal barrel domain. In silico study reveals that a tripeptide (VFK) from Mc7S possess a higher binding affinity for angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) than already reported drug Lisinopril (LPR). The protein is a glycoprotein and highly stable under varying thermal and pH conditions due to its secondary structures. The DPPH (2,2diphenyl1picrylhydrazylhydrate) assay showed the protein to have an antioxygenic nature and can aid in scavenging free radical from sample.

d74bbe358adc48608a127107e4e8cb86,Taskdependent fMRI decoder with the power to extend Gabor patch results to Natural images,"Scientists are often asked to what extent a simple finding in a laboratory can be generalized to complicated phenomena in our daily lives. The same is equally true of vision science; numerous critical discoveries about our visual system have been made using very simple visual images, such as Gabor patches, but to what extent can these findings be applied to more natural images? Here, we used the fMRI decoding technique and directly tested whether the findings obtained with primitive visual stimuli (Gabor patches) were applicable to natural images. In the fMRI experiments, participants performed depth and resolution tasks with both Gabor patches and natural images. We created a fMRI decoder made from the results of the Gabor patch experiments that classified a brain activity pattern into the depth or resolution task, and then examined how successful the taskdependent decoder could sort a brain activity pattern in the natural image experiment into the depth or resolution task. As a result, we found that the taskdependent decoder constructed from Gabor patch experiments could predict which task (depth or resolution task) a participant was engaged in the natural image experiments, especially in the V3 and middle temporal (MT) areas of the brain. This is consistent with previous researches on the cortical activation relating to depth perception rather than perceptual processing of display resolution. These results provide firm evidence that fMRI decoding technique possesses the power to evaluate the application of Gabor patch results (laboratory findings) to the natural images (everyday affairs), representing a new approach for studying the mechanism of visual perception.",Yoshiaki Tsushima; Yasuhito Sawahata; Kazuteru Komine,Human behaviour; Visual system,"Center for Information and Neural Networks, National Institute of Information and Communication Technology, Seikacho, Japan; Science  Technology Research Laboratories, Japan Broadcasting Corporation (NHK), Setagayaku, Japan; Science  Technology Research Laboratories, Japan Broadcasting Corporation (NHK), Setagayaku, Japan; Science  Technology Research Laboratories, Japan Broadcasting Corporation (NHK), Setagayaku, Japan"
23598b48d2db41d6923d28f893546645,Coherent response of the Indian Monsoon Rainfall to Atlantic Multidecadal Variability over the last 2000 years,"Indian Summer Monsoon (ISM) rainfall has a direct effect on the livelihoods of two billion people in the Indiansubcontinent. Yet, our understanding of the drivers of multidecadal variability of the ISM is far from being complete. In this context, largescale forcing of ISM rainfall variability with multidecadal resolution over the last two millennia is investigated using new records of sea surface salinity (18Ow) and sea surface temperatures (SSTs) from the Bay of Bengal (BoB). Higher 18Ow values during the Dark Age Cold Period (1550 to 1250 years BP) and the Little Ice Age (700 to 200 years BP) are suggestive of reduced ISM rainfall, whereas lower 18Ow values during the Medieval Warm Period (1200 to 800 years BP) and the major portion of the Roman Warm Period (1950 to 1550 years BP) indicate a wetter ISM. This variability in ISM rainfall appears to be modulated by the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO) via changes in largescale thermal contrast between the Asian land mass and the Indian Ocean, a relationship that is also identifiable in the observational data of the last century. Therefore, we suggest that interhemispheric scale interactions between such extra tropical forcing mechanisms and global warming are likely to be influential in determining future trends in ISM rainfall.",Pothuri Divakar Naidu; Raja Ganeshram; Massimo A.

In this study we have identified two genes encoding putative GHR and PRLR in sea lamprey (Petromyzon marinus) and Arctic lamprey (Lethenteron camtschaticum), extant members of one of the oldest vertebrate groups, agnathans. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that lamprey GHR and PRLR cluster at the base of gnathostome GHR and PRLR clades, respectively. This indicates that distinct GHR and PRLR arose prior to the emergence of the lamprey branch of agnathans. In the sea lamprey, GHR and PRLR displayed a differential but overlapping pattern of expression; GHR had high expression in liver and heart tissues, whereas PRLR was expressed highly in the brain and moderately in osmoregulatory tissues. Branchial PRLR mRNA levels were significantly elevated by stage 5 of metamorphosis and remained elevated through stage 7, whereas levels of GHR mRNA were only elevated in the final stage (7). Branchial expression of GHR increased following seawater (SW) exposure of juveniles, but expression of PRLR was not significantly altered. The results indicate that GHR and PRLR may both participate in metamorphosis and that GHR may mediate SW acclimation.",Ningping Gong; Diogo FerreiraMartins; Stephen D. McCormick; Mark A.

Nowadays, the T1BL.1RS wheat cultivars have become susceptible to rust diseases because of the monophyletic ('Petkus') origin of 1RS. Here we report and discuss the production and detailed investigation of a new T1BL.1RS translocation line carrying 1RS with widened genetic base originating from Secale cereanum. Line '179' exhibited improved spike morphology traits, resistance against stripe rust and leaf rust, as well as higher tillering capacity, fertility and dietary fiber (arabynoxylan) content than the parental wheat genotype. Comparative analyses based on molecular cytogenetic methods and molecular (SSR and DArTseq) makers indicate that the 1RS arm of line '179' is a recombinant of S. cereale and S. strictum homologues, and approximately 16% of its loci were different from that of 'Petkus' origin. 162 (69.5%) 1RSspecific markers were associated with genes, including 10 markers with putative disease resistance functions and LRR domains found on the subtelomeric or pericentromeric regions of 1RS.

The purpose of this study is to investigate the isolation of singlewall carbon nanotubes based on diameterschirality in a polymersalt (polyethylene glycol and sodium citrate) aqueous twophase system (ATPS) a substitute for common polymerpolymer (polyethylene glycol and dextran) system. The ATPS based on polymersalt used instead of the common polymerpolymer system due to low viscosity, reduced surface tension, and lower cost of sodium citrate compared to the dextran. For this purpose, the ratio of concentrations of polyethylene glycol to sodium citrate as well as the effect of temperature on the isolation are both investigated and the selectivity and the recovery estimated approximately. The absorbance spectra from both top and bottom phases at different polymer and salt contents and at different temperatures show that by using this system in optimal conditions of polymer to salt ratio of 2:1 at temperature of 20 C, a suitable separation of nanotubes with 85% yield of the chiral groups of 9 and 10 can be obtained.",Marziyeh Karandish; Somayeh Fardindoost; Gholamreza Pazuki,Chemical engineering; Nanoscale materials,"Department of Chemical Engineering, Amirkabir University of Technology (Tehran Polytechnic), Tehran, Iran; Department of Physics, Sharif University of Technology, Tehran, Iran; Department of Chemical Engineering, Amirkabir University of Technology (Tehran Polytechnic), Tehran, Iran"

Variables analyzed were age, gender, preoperative visual acuity, axial length, laterality of eyes, operative duration, and the direction and degree of cyclotorsion. The mean cyclotorsion of 107 eyes of 93 cataract patients was 0.98  4.85 degrees (median, 1 degree; range, 11 to 12 degrees), and the median absolute value was 4 degrees (mean, 4.05  2.82 degrees; range, 0 to 12 degrees). Cyclotorsion was 3 degrees in 68 (63.6%) eyes. Excyclotorsion occurred more frequently than incyclotorsion (50.5% vs. 43.0%). There was no cyclotorsion in seven (6.5%). Multiple regression analysis showed that gender was a significant predictive factor for the absolute value of cyclotorsion (  1.06, P  0.041); however, the other variables had no effect on cyclotorsion.

296f3714be6b45b79b90e8e031f0cb93,Double obstacles increase gait asymmetry during obstacle crossing in people with Parkinson's disease and healthy older adults: A pilot study,"Gait asymmetry during unobstructed walking in people with Parkinson's disease (PD) has been well documented. However, under complex situations, such as environments with double obstacles, gait asymmetry remains poorly understood in PD. Therefore, the aim of this study was to analyze interlimb asymmetry while crossing a single obstacle and double obstacles (with different distances between them) in people with PD and healthy older adults. Nineteen people with PD and 19 healthy older people performed three conditions: (i) walking with one obstacle (Single); (ii) walking with two obstacles with a 50 cm distance between them (Double50); (iii) walking with two obstacles with a 108 cm distance between them (Double108). The participants performed the obstacle crossing with both lower limbs. Asymmetry Index was calculated. We found that people with PD presented higher leading and trailing toe clearance asymmetry than healthy older people. In addition, participants increased asymmetry in the Double50 compared to Single condition. It can be concluded that people with PD show higher asymmetry during obstacle crossing compared to healthy older people, independently of the number of obstacles. In addition, a challenging environment induces asymmetry during obstacle crossing in both people with PD and healthy older people.",Diego OrcioliSilva; Fabio Augusto Barbieri; Paulo Cezar Rocha dos Santos; Victor Spiandor Beretta; Lucas Simieli; Rodrigo Vitorio; Ellen LiraniSilva; Lilian Teresa Bucken Gobbi,Basal ganglia; Parkinson's disease,"Sao Paulo State University (UNESP), Institute of Biosciences, Posture and Gait Studies Laboratory (LEPLO), Rio Claro, Brazil; Graduate Program in Movement Sciences, Sao Paulo State University (UNESP), Rio Claro, Brazil; Graduate Program in Movement Sciences, Sao Paulo State University (UNESP), Rio Claro, Brazil; Sao Paulo State University (UNESP), Faculty of Science, Human Movement Research Laboratory (MOVILAB), Bauru, Brazil; Sao Paulo State University (UNESP), Institute of Biosciences, Posture and Gait Studies Laboratory (LEPLO), Rio Claro, Brazil; Graduate Program in Movement Sciences, Sao Paulo State University (UNESP), Rio Claro, Brazil; University of Groningen, University Medical Center Groningen, Center for Human Movement Sciences, Groningen, The Netherlands; Sao Paulo State University (UNESP), Institute of Biosciences, Posture and Gait Studies Laboratory (LEPLO), Rio Claro, Brazil; Graduate Program in Movement Sciences, Sao Paulo State University (UNESP), Rio Claro, Brazil; Graduate Program in Movement Sciences, Sao Paulo State University (UNESP), Rio Claro, Brazil; Sao Paulo State University (UNESP), Faculty of Science, Human Movement Research Laboratory (MOVILAB), Bauru, Brazil; Sao Paulo State University (UNESP), Institute of Biosciences, Posture and Gait Studies Laboratory (LEPLO), Rio Claro, Brazil; Graduate Program in Movement Sciences, Sao Paulo State University (UNESP), Rio Claro, Brazil; Sao Paulo State University (UNESP), Institute of Biosciences, Posture and Gait Studies Laboratory (LEPLO), Rio Claro, Brazil; Graduate Program in Movement Sciences, Sao Paulo State University (UNESP), Rio Claro, Brazil; Sao Paulo State University (UNESP), Institute of Biosciences, Posture and Gait Studies Laboratory (LEPLO), Rio Claro, Brazil; Graduate Program in Movement Sciences, Sao Paulo State University (UNESP), Rio Claro, Brazil"

Therefore, firstly, the coal temperature and gas pressure are measured by temperature and pressure sensors in the process of methane desorption. Secondly, isosteric heats of adsorption are calculated according to the adsorption isotherm. Finally, heat transfer model is established and simulate the temperature evolution during methane desorption in coal under different conditions (initial temperature and gas pressure). The real tests and simulation results show that a lot of heat will be absorbed from coal as methane desorbing, which causes the coal temperature will go down by 5.5 K, and methane desorption is no longer isothermal process. In the initial stage of methane desorption in coal, the coal temperature will decrease sharply to an extremely low value, then slowly rise to the previous ambient temperature. And at the same ambient temperature, the higher the initial methane equilibrium pressure is, the larger the temperature at the coal body center drops in the process of methane desorption. In the coal body, the farther away from the wall of the coal sample canister, the more significant the decrease of the coal body temperature is, and the longer the time is to reach extremely low value, which is mainly due to the different heat transfer coefficients at different positions in the coal body. The total specific power, which is a key index in heat transfer model to simulate the change of coal temperature, sharply decreases during methane desorption, because the methane desorption quantity in unit time decreases gradually. This study has an important practical significance to reveal the evolution mechanism of coal and gas outburst, and predict outburst with temperature change as an index.",Yue Gaowei; Zeng Chunlin; Huo Liupeng; Zheng Xinjun,Coal; Natural hazards,"School of Civil Engineering, Henan Polytechnic University, Jiaozuo, China; School of Civil Engineering, Henan Polytechnic University, Jiaozuo, China; School of Civil Engineering, Henan Polytechnic University, Jiaozuo, China; School of Civil Engineering, Henan Polytechnic University, Jiaozuo, China"

In this study, we obtained data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) on HGSOC and identified scores for the loss of heterozygosity, telomeric allelic imbalance, and largescale state transitions, and calculated the HRD score. We then investigated the relationships among the score, geneticepigenetic alterations in HRRrelated genes, and the clinical data. We found that BRCA12 mutations were enriched in the group with HRD scores 63. Compared with the groups with scores 62, this group had a good prognosis; we thus considered HRD scores 63 to be the best cutoff point for identifying HRD cases in HGSOC. Classification of HGSOC cases by the HRD status revealed a better prognosis for HRD cases caused by genetic alterations (genetic HRD) than those caused by epigenetic changes and those caused by undetermined reasons (p  0.0002). Among cases without macroscopic residual tumors after primary debulking surgery, 11 of 12 genetic HRD cases survived after the median observation period of 6.6 years, showing remarkably high survival rates (p  0.0059). In conclusion, HGSOC can be classified into subtypes with different prognoses according to HRD status.

It has the function of selflearning, which is particularly important for prediction, and it could take advantage of the computer's highspeed computing capabilities and find the optimal solution quickly. In this paper, four culture conditions: agar concentration, light time, culture temperature, and humidity were selected. And a threelayer neural network was used to predict the differentiation rate of melon under these four conditions. Tenfold cross validation revealed that the optimal back propagation neural network was established with traingdx as the training function and the final architecture of 431 (four neurons in the input layer, three neurons in the hidden layer and one neuron in the output layer), which yielded a high coefficient of correlation (R2, 0.9637) between the actual and predicted outputs, and a rootmeansquare error (RMSE) of 0.0108, suggesting that the artificial neural network worked well. According to the optimal culture conditions generated by genetic algorithm, tissue culture experiments had been carried out. The results showed that the actual differentiation rate of melon reached 90.53%, and only 1.59% lower than the predicted value of genetic algorithm. It was better than the optimization by response surface methodology, which the predicted induced differentiation rate is 86.04%, the actual value is 83.62%, and was 2.89% lower than the predicted value. It can be inferred that the combination of artificial neural network and genetic algorithm can optimize the plant tissue culture conditions well and with high prediction accuracy, and this method will have a good application prospect in other biological experiments.",Qiang Zhang; Dandan Deng; Wenting Dai; Jixin Li; Xinwen Jin,Tissues; Urogenital models,"College of Life Science and Technology, Xinjiang University, Urumqi, China; Institute of Agroproducts Processing Science and Technolog, Xinjiang Academy of Agricultural and Reclamation Science, Shihezi, China; Institute of Agroproducts Processing Science and Technolog, Xinjiang Academy of Agricultural and Reclamation Science, Shihezi, China; Institute of Agroproducts Processing Science and Technolog, Xinjiang Academy of Agricultural and Reclamation Science, Shihezi, China; Institute of Agroproducts Processing Science and Technolog, Xinjiang Academy of Agricultural and Reclamation Science, Shihezi, China; Institute of Agroproducts Processing Science and Technolog, Xinjiang Academy of Agricultural and Reclamation Science, Shihezi, China"

They outline the technical challenges in applying machine learning to different types of biological and biomedical data and go on to discuss the challenges in implementing these approaches in the clinical realm, in drug discovery programs and within regulatory agencies. Deep learning is beginning to impact biological research and biomedical applications as a result of its ability to integrate vast datasets, learn arbitrarily complex relationships and incorporate existing knowledge. Already, deep learning models can predict, with varying degrees of success, how genetic variation alters cellular processes involved in pathogenesis, which small molecules will modulate the activity of therapeutically relevant proteins, and whether radiographic images are indicative of disease. However, the flexibility of deep learning creates new challenges in guaranteeing the performance of deployed systems and in establishing trust with stakeholders, clinicians and regulators, who require a rationale for decision making. We argue that these challenges will be overcome using the same flexibility that created them; for example, by training deep models so that they can output a rationale for their predictions.

Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy in solution is one of the key approaches for expanding this platform with dynamic features, which can be accessed at physiological temperature and with minimal modification of the wildtype GPCR covalent structures.

ClustEval can be used to find data clusters using multiple algorithms and to evaluate new clustering methods. Clustering is a popular technique for discovering groups of similar objects in large datasets. It is nowadays applied in all areas of life sciences, from biomedicine to physics. However, designing highquality cluster analyses is a tedious and complicated task with manifold choices along the way. As a cluster analysis is often the first step of a succeeding downstream analysis, the clustering must be reliable, reproducible, and of the highest quality. To address these challenges, we recently developed ClustEval, an integrated and extensible platform for the automated and standardized design and execution of complex cluster analyses. It allows researchers to design and carry out cluster analyses involving a large number of clustering methods applied to many, large datasets. ClustEval helps to shed light on all major aspects of cluster analysis, from choosing the right similarity function to using validity indices and data preprocessing protocols. Only this high degree of automation allows the researcher to easily run a clustering task with many different tools, parameters, and settings in order to gain the best possible outcome. In this paper, we guide the user step by step through three fundamentally important and widely applicable use cases: (i) identification of the best clustering method for a new, usergiven protein sequence similarity dataset; (ii) evaluation of the performance of a new, usergiven clustering method (densityCut) against the state of the art; and (iii) prediction of the best method for a new protein sequence similarity dataset.

The existing fabrication processes, which usually involve film deposition in combination with electronbeam patterning, are either timeconsuming or offer limited precision. Inspired by the kirigami, an ancient handicraft art of paper cutting, this work demonstrates an electronbeam patterning process for multiscale metallic structures with significantly enhanced efficiency and precision. Similar to the kirigami, in which the final pattern is defined by cutting its contour in a paper and then removing the unwanted parts, we define the target multiscale structures by first creating nanotrench contours in a metallic film via an electronbeambased process and then selectively peeling the separated film outside the contours. Compared with the conventional approach, which requires the exposure of the whole pattern, much less exposure area is needed for nanotrench contours, thus enabling reduced exposure time and enhanced geometric precision due to the mitigated proximity effect. A theoretical model based on interface mechanics allows a clear understanding of the nanotrenchassisted selective debonding behaviour in the peeling process. By using this fabrication process, multiscale metallic structures with sub10nm up to submillimetre features can be reliably achieved, having potential applications for anticounterfeiting and gapplasmonenhanced spectroscopy. A centuriesold papercrafting technique has inspired an approach for the reproducible manufacture of metal structures with precisely defined macro and nanoscale features. Many electronic devices incorporate such elements, but current production processes struggle with the ability to accurately sculpt both millimeter and nanometersized design elements. Researchers led by Yihui Zhang of Tsinghua University and Huigao Duan of Hunan University tackled this challenge with a 21st century version of 'kirigami', an ancient aesthetic pursuit of artistic papercutting. The authors used an electron beam to precisely cut multiscale patterns into a thin metallic film, and then used adhesive tape to peel away unwanted elements of the film. Using this technique, the authors demonstrate the capability to produce a range of designs with both submillimeter and nanometerscale features, which could prove useful in applications including anticounterfeiting or optical detection.

In the present study, we analysed whether the risk for bipolar disorder (BD) in BD multiplex families is influenced by common genetic variants. Furthermore, we investigated whether this risk is conferred mainly by BDspecific risk variants or by variants also associated with the susceptibility to schizophrenia or major depression. In total, 395 individuals from 33 Andalusian BD multiplex families (166 BD, 78 major depressive disorder, 151 unaffected) as well as 438 subjects from an independent, BD casecontrol cohort (161 unrelated BD, 277 unrelated controls) were analysed. Polygenic risk scores (PRS) for BD, schizophrenia (SCZ), and major depression were calculated and compared between the cohorts. Both the familial BD cases and unaffected family members had higher PRS for all three psychiatric disorders than the independent controls, with BD and SCZ being significant after correction for multiple testing, suggesting a high baseline risk for several psychiatric disorders in the families. Moreover, familial BD cases showed significantly higher BD PRS than unaffected family members and unrelated BD cases. A plausible hypothesis is that, in multiplex families with a general increase in risk for psychiatric disease, BD development is attributable to a high burden of common variants that confer a specific risk for BD. The present analyses demonstrated that common genetic risk variants for psychiatric disorders are likely to contribute to the high incidence of affective psychiatric disorders in the multiplex families. However, the PRS explained only part of the observed phenotypic variance, and rare variants might have also contributed to disease development.",Till F. M.

aaa8514312e74d44a3b2e2c09d34d5d1,An assessment of three contemporary dental caries epidemiological instruments: a critical review,"Aim  Dental caries epidemiological surveys produce information that may be used to assist health policy makers in the planning of preventive and curative strategies. The detection instruments used in these surveys should be able to identify the correct, true stage of the disease or medical condition. This makes it essential that valid instruments are used. This study aimed to critically review commonly used visualtactile caries assessment instruments in epidemiological surveys with respect to their manageability, reproducibility and validity, and how results are reported. Method  A Pubmed search identified the following international visualtactile instruments for caries detection more than once between 2013 and 2018: World Health Organisation (WHO), International Caries Detection and Assessment System (ICDAS) and Caries Assessment Spectrum and Treatment (CAST). Results  The review revealed that the WHO instrument can be considered a screening instrument, that the ICDAS instrument lacks sufficient validity and takes time to apply and that the CAST instrument is promising, but requires further field testing before it can be considered a fully proven cariesassessment instrument in epidemiology. It is recommended that calculating caries prevalence should be based on the presence of cavitated dentine carious lesions, that the prevalence of enamel carious lesions be reported separately and that the dmfDMF index not be used in its current form. Conclusion  Researchersdentists should be knowledgeable of the limitations and advantages of common caries assessment instruments. Caries prevalence should not be based on the dmfDMF index but on cavitated dentine carious lesions (dDcomponent) as the M and Fcomponent do not refer to a disease stage.",Jo E. Frencken; Rodrigo A.

The best HER catalysts rely on the use of platinum and show the highest performance in acidic media. Efficient HER catalysts based on inexpensive and Earthabundant elements that operate in neutral (hence biocompatible) media could enable lowcost direct seawater splitting and the realization of bioupgraded chemical fuels. In the challenging neutralpH environment, water splitting is a multistep reaction. Here we present a HER catalyst comprising Ni and CrOx sites doped onto a Cu surface that operates efficiently in neutral media. The Ni and CrOx sites have strong binding energies for hydrogen and hydroxyl groups, respectively, which accelerates water dissociation, whereas the Cu has a weak hydrogen binding energy, promoting hydride coupling. The resulting catalyst exhibits a 48 mV overpotential at a current density of 10 mA cm2 in a pH 7 buffer electrolyte. These findings suggest design principles for inexpensive, efficient and biocompatible catalytic systems. Integrating electrocatalytic H2 production with biological H2fed systems for CO2 upgrading requires H2 generation to occur in biocompatible mediatypically with neutral pH. Here, the authors design multisite H2 evolution catalysts that minimize the water dissociation barrier and promote hydride coupling in neutral media.",CaoThang Dinh; Ankit Jain; F.

However, trapezoidal boundary geometry distorts the regular firing patterns of entorhinal grid cells, proposedly providing a metric for cognitive maps. Here we test the impact of trapezoidal boundary geometry on human spatial memory using immersive virtual reality. Consistent with reduced regularity of grid patterns in rodents and a gridcell model based on the eigenvectors of the successor representation, human positional memory was degraded in a trapezoid environment compared with a square environmentan effect that was particularly pronounced in the narrow part of the trapezoid. Congruent with changes in the spatial frequency of eigenvector grid patterns, distance estimates between remembered positions were persistently biased, revealing distorted memory maps that explained behaviour better than the objective maps. Our findings demonstrate that environmental geometry affects human spatial memory in a similar manner to rodent gridcell activity and, therefore, strengthen the putative link between grid cells and behaviour along with their cognitive functions beyond navigation. Bellmund et al. use immersive virtual reality combined with successor representation modelling to show that environmental geometry distorts human spatial memory consistent with deformations of gridcell firing patterns in navigating rodents.",Jacob L.

In this context, cluster states4 are particularly interesting because they can enable the realization of universal quantum computers by means of a 'oneway' scheme5, where processing is performed through measurements6. The generation of cluster states based on subsystems that have more than two dimensions, dlevel cluster states, provides increased quantum resources while keeping the number of parties constant7, and also enables novel algorithms8. Here, we experimentally realize, characterize and test the noise sensitivity of threelevel, fourpartite cluster states formed by two photons in the time9 and frequency10 domain, confirming genuine multipartite entanglement with higher noise robustness compared to conventional twolevel cluster states6,1113. We perform proofofconcept highdimensional oneway quantum operations, where the cluster states are transformed into orthogonal, maximally entangled dlevel twopartite states by means of projection measurements. Our scalable approach is based on integrated photonic chips9,10 and optical fibre communication components, thus achieving new and deterministic functionalities.

d1ba9aed7b8d466e9a01e58b4d9f4753,Longterm cyclic persistence in an experimental predatorprey system,"Predatorprey cycles rank among the most fundamental concepts in ecology, are predicted by the simplest ecological models and enable, theoretically, the indefinite persistence of predator and prey14. However, it remains an open question for how long cyclic dynamics can be selfsustained in real communities. Field observations have been restricted to a few cycle periods58 and experimental studies indicate that oscillations may be shortlived without external stabilizing factors919. Here we performed microcosm experiments with a planktonic predatorprey system and repeatedly observed oscillatory time series of unprecedented length that persisted for up to around 50 cycles or approximately 300 predator generations. The dominant type of dynamics was characterized by regular, coherent oscillations with a nearly constant predatorprey phase difference. Despite constant experimental conditions, we also observed shorter episodes of irregular, noncoherent oscillations without any significant phase relationship. However, the predatorprey system showed a strong tendency to return to the dominant dynamical regime with a defined phase relationship. A mathematical model suggests that stochasticity is probably responsible for the reversible shift from coherent to noncoherent oscillations, a notion that was supported by experiments with external forcing by pulsed nutrient supply. Our findings empirically demonstrate the potential for infinite persistence of predator and prey populations in a cyclic dynamic regime that shows resilience in the presence of stochastic events. The potential for infinite persistence of planktonic predator and prey cycles is experimentally demonstrated and these cycles show resilience in the presence of stochastic events.",Bernd Blasius; Lars Rudolf; Guntram Weithoff; Ursula Gaedke; Gregor F.

6e2133b0edec4c299ba51d820a26238b,Internal state dynamics shape brainwide activity and foraging behaviour,"The brain has persistent internal states that can modulate every aspect of an animal's mental experience14. In complex tasks such as foraging, the internal state is dynamic58. Caenorhabditis elegans alternate between local search and global dispersal5. Rodents and primates exhibit tradeoffs between exploitation and exploration6,7. However, fundamental questions remain about how persistent states are maintained in the brain, which upstream networks drive state transitions and how stateencoding neurons exert neuromodulatory effects on sensory perception and decisionmaking to govern appropriate behaviour. Here, using tracking microscopy to monitor wholebrain neuronal activity at cellular resolution in freely moving zebrafish larvae9, we show that zebrafish spontaneously alternate between two persistent internal states during foraging for live prey (Paramecia). In the exploitation state, the animal inhibits locomotion and promotes hunting, generating small, localized trajectories. In the exploration state, the animal promotes locomotion and suppresses hunting, generating longranging trajectories that enhance spatial dispersion. We uncover a dorsal raphe subpopulation with persistent activity that robustly encodes the exploitation state. The exploitationstateencoding neurons, together with a multimodal trigger network that is associated with state transitions, form a stochastically activated nonlinear dynamical system. The activity of this oscillatory network correlates with a global retuning of sensorimotor transformations during foraging that leads to marked changes in both the motivation to hunt for prey and the accuracy of motor sequences during hunting. This work reveals an important hidden variable that shapes the temporal structure of motivation and decisionmaking. During foraging for live prey, zebrafish larvae alternate between persistent exploitation and exploration behavioural states that correlate with distinct patterns of neuronal activation.",Joao C.

However, current prediction algorithms have limited predictive power, in part because they were not trained on highquality epitope datasets covering a broad range of HLA alleles. To enable prediction of endogenous HLA class Iassociated peptides across a large fraction of the human population, we used mass spectrometry to profile 185,000 peptides eluted from 95 HLAA, B, C and G monoallelic cell lines. We identified canonical peptide motifs per HLA allele, unique and shared binding submotifs across alleles and distinct motifs associated with different peptide lengths. By integrating these data with transcript abundance and peptide processing, we developed HLAthena, providing alleleandlengthspecific and panallelepanlength prediction models for endogenous peptide presentation. These models predicted endogenous HLA class Iassociated ligands with 1.5fold improvement in positive predictive value compared with existing tools and correctly identified 75% of HLAbound peptides that were observed experimentally in 11 patientderived tumor cell lines.

575802b0e54d4205b8306ca955afcb04,DEL1 promotes macrophage efferocytosis and clearance of inflammation,"Resolution of inflammation is essential for tissue homeostasis and represents a promising approach to inflammatory disorders. Here we found that developmental endothelial locus1 (DEL1), a secreted protein that inhibits leukocyteendothelial adhesion and inflammation initiation, also functions as a nonredundant downstream effector in inflammation clearance. In human and mouse periodontitis, waning of inflammation was correlated with DEL1 upregulation, whereas resolution of experimental periodontitis failed in DEL1 deficiency. This concept was mechanistically substantiated in acute monosodiumuratecrystalinduced inflammation, where the proresolution function of DEL1 was attributed to effective apoptotic neutrophil clearance (efferocytosis). DEL1mediated efferocytosis induced liver X receptordependent macrophage reprogramming to a proresolving phenotype and was required for optimal production of at least certain specific proresolving mediators. Experiments in transgenic mice with cellspecific overexpression of DEL1 linked its antileukocyterecruitment action to endothelial cellderived DEL1 and its efferocyticproresolving action to macrophagederived DEL1. Thus, the compartmentalized expression of DEL1 facilitates distinct homeostatic functions in an appropriate context that can be harnessed therapeutically. DEL1 protein interferes with leukocyte adhesion to prevent inflammation. Chavakis and colleagues now show that DEL1 contributes to tissue resolution after inflammation by promoting macrophagemediated efferocytosis and M2like proresolving activities.",Ioannis Kourtzelis; Xiaofei Li; Ioannis Mitroulis; Daniel Grosser; Tetsuhiro Kajikawa; Baomei Wang; Michal Grzybek; Janusz von Renesse; Aleksander Czogalla; Maria Troullinaki; Anaisa Ferreira; Christian Doreth; Klara Ruppova; LanSun Chen; Kavita Hosur; JongHyung Lim; KyoungJin Chung; Sylvia Grossklaus; Anne Kathrin Tausche; Leo A.

8db1dc07088e4cfd81cf878542e975f9,The phosphatase PAC1 acts as a T cell suppressor and attenuates host antitumor immunity,"Cancer cells subvert immune surveillance through inhibition of T cell effector function. Elucidation of the mechanism of T cell dysfunction is therefore central to cancer immunotherapy. Here, we report that dual specificity phosphatase 2 (DUSP2; also known as phosphatase of activated cells 1, PAC1) acts as an immune checkpoint in T cell antitumor immunity. PAC1 is selectively upregulated in exhausted tumorinfiltrating lymphocytes and is associated with poor prognosis of patients with cancer. PAC1hi effector T cells lose their proliferative and effector capacities and convert into exhausted T cells. Deletion of PAC1 enhances immune responses and reduces cancer susceptibility in mice. Through activation of EGR1, excessive reactive oxygen species in the tumor microenvironment induce expression of PAC1, which recruits the Mi2 nucleosomeremodeling and histonedeacetylase complex, eventually leading to chromatin remodeling of effector T cells. Our study demonstrates that PAC1 is an epigenetic immune regulator and highlights the importance of targeting PAC1 in cancer immunotherapy.

e0abe967d3234ae3a19d168f937a11ef,Thalamic regulation of switching between cortical representations enables cognitive flexibility,"Interactions between the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and mediodorsal thalamus are critical for cognitive flexibility, yet the underlying computations are unknown. To investigate frontothalamic substrates of cognitive flexibility, we developed a behavioral task in which mice switched between different sets of learned cues that guided attention toward either visual or auditory targets. We found that PFC responses reflected both the individual cues and their meaning as task rules, indicating a hierarchical cuetorule transformation. Conversely, mediodorsal thalamus responses reflected the statistical regularity of cue presentation and were required for switching between such experimentally specified cueing contexts. A subset of these thalamic responses sustained contextrelevant PFC representations, while another suppressed the contextirrelevant ones. Through modeling and experimental validation, we find that thalamicmediated suppression may not only reduce PFC representational interference but could also preserve unused cortical traces for future use. Overall, our study provides a computational foundation for thalamic engagement in cognitive flexibility. Rikhye et al. recorded prefrontal and thalamic populations from mice performing attention selection across different contexts. By encoding context, the thalamus both enhances and suppresses prefrontal representations in a contextappropriate manner.",Rajeev V. Rikhye; Aditya Gilra; Michael M.

1999a22f6ad64d6e94355337b51dfa6b,Neural circuits for evidence accumulation and decision making in larval zebrafish,"To make appropriate decisions, animals need to accumulate sensory evidence. Simple integrator models can explain many aspects of such behavior, but how the underlying computations are mechanistically implemented in the brain remains poorly understood. Here we approach this problem by adapting the randomdot motion discrimination paradigm, classically used in primate studies, to larval zebrafish. Using their innate optomotor response as a measure of decision making, we find that larval zebrafish accumulate and remember motion evidence over many seconds and that the behavior is in close agreement with a bounded leaky integrator model. Through the use of brainwide functional imaging, we identify three neuronal clusters in the anterior hindbrain that are well suited to execute the underlying computations. By relating the dynamics within these structures to individual behavioral choices, we propose a biophysically plausible circuit arrangement in which an evidence integrator competes against a dynamic decision threshold to activate a downstream motor command. Bahl and Engert show that larval zebrafish can temporally integrate sensory information. The authors then use brainwide functional imaging to search for, characterize and model brain areas that are wellsuited to implement the underlying processes.",Armin Bahl; Florian Engert,Biophysical models; Decision; Fluorescence imaging; Neural circuits; Sensory processing,"Department of Molecular and Cellular Biology, Harvard University, Cambridge, USA; Department of Molecular and Cellular Biology, Harvard University, Cambridge, USA"

These channels are widely distributed from bacteria to higher plants and humans, and are involved in many crucial physiological processes. Here we show that two members of the OSCA protein family in Arabidopsis thaliana, namely AtOSCA1.1 and AtOSCA3.1, belong to a new class of mechanosensitive ion channels. We solve the structure of the AtOSCA1.1 channel at 3.5A resolution and AtOSCA3.1 at 4.8A resolution by cryoelectron microscopy. OSCA channels are symmetric dimers that are mediated by cytosolic intersubunit interactions. Strikingly, they have structural similarity to the mammalian TMEM16 family proteins. Our structural analysis accompanied with electrophysiological studies identifies the ion permeation pathway within each subunit and suggests a conformational change model for activation. CryoEM and electrophysiological studies of two mechanosensitive OSCA channels from Arabidopsis thaliana reveal their structural similarity to osmosensitive TMEM16 channels and suggest they are gated by force from lipid in response to osmotic stress.",Mingfeng Zhang; Dali Wang; Yunlu Kang; JingXiang Wu; Fuqiang Yao; Chengfang Pan; Zhiqiang Yan; Chen Song; Lei Chen,Cryoelectron microscopy; Ion transport,"State Key Laboratory of Membrane Biology, Institute of Molecular Medicine, Peking University, Beijing Key Laboratory of Cardiometabolic Molecular Medicine, Beijing, China; PekingTsinghua Center for Life Sciences, Peking University, Beijing, China; Academy for Advanced Interdisciplinary Studies, Peking University, Beijing, China; Center for Quantitative Biology, Academy for Advanced Interdisciplinary Studies, Peking University, Beijing, China; State Key Laboratory of Membrane Biology, Institute of Molecular Medicine, Peking University, Beijing Key Laboratory of Cardiometabolic Molecular Medicine, Beijing, China; State Key Laboratory of Membrane Biology, Institute of Molecular Medicine, Peking University, Beijing Key Laboratory of Cardiometabolic Molecular Medicine, Beijing, China; PekingTsinghua Center for Life Sciences, Peking University, Beijing, China; State Key Laboratory of Medical Neurobiology, Human Phenome Institute, Ministry of Education Key Laboratory of Contemporary Anthropology, Collaborative Innovation Center of Genetics and Development, Department of Physiology and Biophysics, School of Life Sciences, Fudan University, Shanghai, China; State Key Laboratory of Medical Neurobiology, Human Phenome Institute, Ministry of Education Key Laboratory of Contemporary Anthropology, Collaborative Innovation Center of Genetics and Development, Department of Physiology and Biophysics, School of Life Sciences, Fudan University, Shanghai, China; State Key Laboratory of Medical Neurobiology, Human Phenome Institute, Ministry of Education Key Laboratory of Contemporary Anthropology, Collaborative Innovation Center of Genetics and Development, Department of Physiology and Biophysics, School of Life Sciences, Fudan University, Shanghai, China; PekingTsinghua Center for Life Sciences, Peking University, Beijing, China; Academy for Advanced Interdisciplinary Studies, Peking University, Beijing, China; Center for Quantitative Biology, Academy for Advanced Interdisciplinary Studies, Peking University, Beijing, China; State Key Laboratory of Membrane Biology, Institute of Molecular Medicine, Peking University, Beijing Key Laboratory of Cardiometabolic Molecular Medicine, Beijing, China; PekingTsinghua Center for Life Sciences, Peking University, Beijing, China"

Understanding their crystallization mechanisms is therefore central to many areas of biology, biogeoscience, and biochemistry. Some biominerals, such as bone and dentin, are hierarchical nanocomposite structures constructed by sequential addition of individual oriented nanocrystals. The driving forces that enable this oriented assembly are still poorly understood, with advances in understanding limited in part by the availability of techniques that can precisely measure the delicate interactions between nanocrystals as a function of their separation distance and mutual orientation. Here, we provide a comprehensive protocol for (i) fabricating oriented singlenanocrystal atomic force microscopy (AFM) probes using focused ion beam (FIB) milling and (ii) performing oriented nanocrystal interaction force measurements using dynamic force spectroscopy (DFS)based AFM and environmental transmission electron microscopy (ETEM)AFM techniques. We illustrate how to fabricate oriented nanocrystal force probes using commercial bulk crystals or nanomicrocrystals of calcite, zinc oxide, and rutile. The typical protocol for fabricating one AFM crystal probe takes 23 h. In addition, we illustrate how to quantify the directionspecific interaction forces for a given pair of interacting oriented nanocrystal faces. The methods are fully transferrable to other minerals of interest, such as the apatites constituting bone minerals. This allows researchers across many fields to measure and understand particlebased crystallization processes. This protocol describes focused ion beammilling approaches for fabricating oriented singlenanocrystal atomic force microscopy probes, as well as how to measure directionspecific interaction forces between nanocrystals in solution and in vacuum.",Xin Zhang; Yang He; Jia Liu; Mark E.

9c278aee86e941bd95be821a41e71d0a,"Formation of decimeterscale, longlived elevated ionic conductivity regions in thunderclouds","We propose a scenario in which elevated ionic conductivity regions (EICRs) with dimensions of the order of 0.11 m are formed in the turbulent thundercloud environment. The starting point in this scenario is the occurrence of electron avalanches in the vicinity of colliding hydrometeors, leading to the formation of ion production centers. Their dimensions are of the order of 1{0}^{3}1{0}^{2} m, and their lifetime is of the order of 1{0}^{4}1{0}^{3} s. When a new ion production center is created inside the decimeterscale residual ion concentration spot left behind by a previously established center, the local ion concentration steadily increases, which leads to the formation of decimeterscale EICRs whose lifetime is measured in seconds. The relatively high conductivity of EICRs (up to 1{0}^{9} Sm or so) relative to the background conductivity (1{0}^{14} Sm or less) ensures their polarization in external electric field within a few milliseconds or so. The EICR formation mechanism requires only one condition: the rate of occurrence of ion production centers per unit time in a unit volume should exceed the percolationtheorybased critical level of 1{0}^{1} m{}^{3} s{}^{1}. Hydrometeor collision rates three and even four orders of magnitude higher than this value have been reported from observations. Presence of EICRs in the cloud provides local electric field enhancements and preionization levels that will lead to the formation of additional ion production centers and may be sufficient for the initiation and development of streamers and, eventually, lightning.",D.

The transfer of data to the touchscreen is achieved using a 12 bit thinfilm capacitive radiofrequency identification tag powered by a thinfilm battery or a thinfilm photovoltaic cell that converts light from the screen. The thinfilm integrated circuit has a 0.8 cm2 onchip monolithic antenna, employs 439 transistors and dissipates only 31 nW of power at a supply voltage of 600 mV. The chip has an asynchronous data rate of up to 36 bps, which is limited by the touchscreen readout electronics.

a228fa532f524803ab31239ee4142d53,Patterns of polymorphism and selection in the subgenomes of the allopolyploid Arabidopsis kamchatica,"Genome duplication is widespread in wild and crop plants. However, little is known about genomewide selection in polyploids due to the complexity of duplicated genomes. In polyploids, the patterns of purifying selection and adaptive substitutions may be affected by masking owing to duplicated genes or homeologs as well as effective population size. Here, we resequence 25 accessions of the allotetraploid Arabidopsis kamchatica, which is derived from the diploid species A. halleri and A. lyrata. We observe a reduction in purifying selection compared with the parental species. Interestingly, proportions of adaptive nonsynonymous substitutions are significantly positive in contrast to most plant species. A recurrent pattern observed in both frequency and divergencediversity neutrality tests is that the genomewide distributions of both subgenomes are similar, but the correlation between homeologous pairs is low. This may increase the opportunity of different evolutionary trajectories such as in the HMA4 gene involved in heavy metal hyperaccumulation. Despite the prevalence of genome duplication in plants, little is known about the evolutionary patterns of entire subgenomes.

To unravel the underlying mechanism, we study fluorescently labeled mononucleosomes by multiparameter FRET measurements and characterize their structural and dynamic heterogeneity upon NaClinduced destabilization. Speciesselective fluorescence lifetime analysis and dynamic photon distribution analysis reveal intermediates during nucleosome opening and lead to a coherent structural and kinetic model. In dynamic octasomes and hexasomes the interface between the H2AH2B dimers and the (H3H4)2 tetramer opens asymmetrically by an angle of 20 on a 50 and 15 s time scale, respectively. This is followed by a slower stepwise release of the dimers coupled with DNA unwrapping. A mutation (H2AR81A) at the interface between H2A and H3 facilitates initial opening, confirming the central role of the dimer:tetramer interface for nucleosome stability. Partially opened states such as those described here might serve as convenient nucleation sites for DNArecognizing proteins.

Floquet topological states were suggested to emerge in photodressed bands under periodic laser driving. Here we propose a viable nonequilibrium route without requiring coherent Floquet states to reach the elusive magnetic Weyl semimetallic phase in pyrochlore iridates by ultrafast modification of the effective electronelectron interaction with short laser pulses. Combining ab initio calculations for a timedependent selfconsistent lightreduced Hubbard U and nonequilibrium magnetism simulations for quantum quenches, we find dynamically modified magnetic order giving rise to transiently emerging Weyl cones that can be probed by time and angleresolved photoemission spectroscopy. Our work offers a unique and realistic pathway for nonequilibrium materials engineering beyond Floquet physics to create and sustain Weyl semimetals. This may lead to ultrafast, tensoffemtoseconds switching protocols for lightengineered Berry curvature in combination with ultrafast magnetism.

As such, materials capable of reversibly capturing this commodity chemical in an energyefficient manner are of interest. Recently, we detailed diamineappended metalorganic frameworks capable of selectively capturing CO2 through a cooperative insertion mechanism that promotes efficient adsorptiondesorption cycling. We therefore sought to explore the ability of these materials to capture CS2 through a similar mechanism. Employing crystallography, spectroscopy, and gas adsorption analysis, we demonstrate that CS2 is indeed cooperatively adsorbed in N,Ndimethylethylenediamineappended M2(dobpdc) (M  Mg, Mn, Zn; dobpdc4  4,4dioxidobiphenyl3,3dicarboxylate), via the formation of electrostatically paired ammonium dithiocarbamate chains. In the weakly thiophilic Mg congener, chemisorption is cleanly reversible with mild thermal input. This work demonstrates that the cooperative insertion mechanism can be generalized to other highimpact target molecules. The largescale production of CS2 presents both environmental and biological hazards, yet adsorbents capable of CS2 capture remain scarcely explored.

We developed a bioinformatic approach to discover m1A and other modifications in mRNA throughout the transcriptome by analyzing preexisting ultradeep RNASeq data for modificationinduced misincorporations. Using this approach, we detected appreciable levels of m1A only in one mRNA: the mitochondrial MTND5 transcript. As an alternative approach, we also developed an antibodybased m1Amapping approach to detect m1A at singlenucleotide resolution, and confirmed that the commonly used m1A antibody maps sites to the transcriptionstart site in mRNA 5'UTRs. However, further analysis revealed that these were falsepositives caused by binding of the antibody to the m7Gcap. A different m1A antibody that lacks capbinding crossreactivity does not show enriched binding in 5'UTRs. These results demonstrate that highstoichiometry m1A sites are exceedingly rare in mRNAs and that previous mappings of m1A to 5'UTRs were the result of antibody crossreactivity to the 5' cap. N1methyladenosine (m1A) was recently reported as a new mRNA modification but its prevalence has been controversial. Here the authors showed that m1A, if present in mRNA, is at very low stoichiometry, with the notable exception of MTND5. Further, they show that the previously reported enrichment of m1A near the start of transcripts are falsepositive identifications due to crossreactivity of the commonly used m1A antibody with mRNA caps.",Anya V.

In this work, we dissect the functional role of the HOXBAS3 lncRNA in patients with NPM1mutated (NPM1mut) acute myeloid leukemia (AML). We show that HOXBAS3 regulates the proliferative capacity of NPM1mut AML blasts in vitro and in vivo. HOXBAS3 is shown to interact with the ErbB3binding protein 1 (EBP1) and guide EBP1 to the ribosomal DNA locus. Via this mechanism, HOXBAS3 regulates ribosomal RNA transcription and de novo protein synthesis. We propose that in the context of NPM1 mutations, HOXBAS3 overexpression acts as a compensatory mechanism, which allows adequate protein production in leukemic blasts. LncRNAs at the HOX gene locus are increased in expression in NPM1 mutant acute myeloid leukemia.

ccd22ff7708447a1864129a01d17acaf,Oxidation and alkylation stresses activate ribosomequality control,"Oxidation and alkylation of nucleobases are known to disrupt their basepairing properties within RNA. It is, however, unclear whether organisms have evolved general mechanism(s) to deal with this damage. Here we show that the mRNAsurveillance pathway of nogo decay and the associated ribosomequality control are activated in response to nucleobase alkylation and oxidation. Our findings reveal that these processes are important for clearing chemically modified mRNA and the resulting aberrantprotein products. In the absence of Xrn1, the level of damaged mRNA significantly increases. Furthermore, deletion of LTN1 results in the accumulation of protein aggregates in the presence of oxidizing and alkylating agents. This accumulation is accompanied by Hel2dependent regulatory ubiquitylation of ribosomal proteins. Collectively, our data highlight the burden of chemically damaged mRNA on cellular homeostasis and suggest that organisms evolved mechanisms to counter their accumulation. The mRNAsurveillance pathway of nogo decay (NGD) is a eukaryotic ribosomebasedqualitycontrol process that targets transcripts that stall the ribosome. Here the authors show nogo decay (NGD) and ribosomequality control (RQC) pathways are activated by mRNAs damaged by alkylation and oxidation stress.",Liewei L. Yan; Carrie L.

00e7d8986c794680891bad81b43db51b,SKP2 attenuates autophagy through Beclin1ubiquitination and its inhibition reduces MERSCoronavirus infection,"Autophagy is an essential cellular process affecting virus infections and other diseases and Beclin1 (BECN1) is one of its key regulators. Here, we identified Sphase kinaseassociated protein 2 (SKP2) as E3 ligase that executes lysine48linked polyubiquitination of BECN1, thus promoting its proteasomal degradation. SKP2 activity is regulated by phosphorylation in a heterocomplex involving FKBP51, PHLPP, AKT1, and BECN1. Genetic or pharmacological inhibition of SKP2 decreases BECN1 ubiquitination, decreases BECN1 degradation and enhances autophagic flux. Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERSCoV) multiplication results in reduced BECN1 levels and blocks the fusion of autophagosomes and lysosomes. Inhibitors of SKP2 not only enhance autophagy but also reduce the replication of MERSCoV up to 28,000fold. The SKP2BECN1 link constitutes a promising target for hostdirected antiviral drugs and possibly other autophagysensitive conditions. Here, Gassen et al. show that Sphase kinaseassociated protein 2 (SKP2) is responsible for lysine48linked polyubiquitination of beclin 1, resulting in its proteasomal degradation, and that inhibition of SKP2 enhances autophagy and reduces replication of MERS coronavirus.",Nils C.

Despite enormous interest, the design of nanoscale allosteric assemblies has proven tremendously challenging. Here we present a proof of concept of allosteric assembly in which an engineered fold switch on the protein monomer triggers or blocks assembly. Our design is based on the hyperstable, naturally monomeric protein CI2, a paradigm of simple twostate folding, and the toroidal arrangement with 6fold symmetry that it only adopts in crystalline form. We engineer CI2 to enable a switch between the native and an alternate, latent fold that selfassembles onto hexagonal toroidal particles by exposing a favorable intermonomer interface. The assembly is controlled on demand via the competing effects of temperature and a designed short peptide. These findings unveil a remarkable potential for structural metamorphosis in proteins and demonstrate key principles for engineering proteinbased nanomachinery. The design of protein assemblies is a major thrust for biomolecular engineering and nanobiotechnology. Here the authors demonstrate a general mechanism for designing allosteric macromolecular assemblies and showcase a proof of concept for engineered allosteric protein assembly.",Luis A.

Here we report a general and practical protocol for regioselective dearomative annulation of indole and benzofuran derivatives in an electrochemical way. Under undivided electrolytic conditions, a series of highly functionalized five to eightmembered heterocycle2,3fused indolines and dihydrobenzofurans, which are typically unattainable under thermal conditions, can be successfully accessed in high yield with excellent regio and stereoselectivity. This transformation can also tolerate a wide range of functional groups and achieve good efficiency in largescale synthesis under oxidantfree conditions. In addition, cyclic voltammetry, electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) and kinetic studies indicate that the dehydrogenative dearomatization annulations arise from the anodic oxidation of indole into indole radical cation, and this process is the ratedetermining step. Enriching the chemical space of polycyclic heterocycles is of high value in chemical biology. Here, the authors report an electrooxidative protocol for the regioselective dearomative annulation of indoles and benzofurans under undivided cell conditions and obtain five to eightmembered fused heterocycles.",Kun Liu; Wenxu Song; Yuqi Deng; Huiyue Yang; Chunlan Song; Takfaoui Abdelilah; Shengchun Wang; Hengjiang Cong; Shan Tang; Aiwen Lei,Catalytic mechanisms; Electrochemistry; Synthetic chemistry methodology,"College of Chemistry and Molecular Sciences, Institute for Advanced Studies (IAS), Wuhan University, Wuhan, P.

71aa5244c77f4e9691c5eb20e7e32956,Sensing of HIV1 by TLR8 activates human T cells and reverses latency,"During HIV infection, celltocell transmission results in endosomal uptake of the virus by target CD4 T cells and potential exposure of the viral ssRNA genome to endosomal Tolllike receptors (TLRs). TLRs are instrumental in activating inflammatory responses in innate immune cells, but their function in adaptive immune cells is less well understood. Here we show that synthetic ligands of TLR8 boosted T cell receptor signaling, resulting in increased cytokine production and upregulation of surface activation markers. Adjuvant TLR8 stimulation, but not TLR7 or TLR9, further promoted T helper cell differentiation towards Th1 and Th17. In addition, we found that endosomal HIV induced cytokine secretion from CD4 T cells in a TLR8specific manner. TLR8 engagement also enhanced HIV1 replication and potentiated the reversal of latency in patientderived T cells. The adjuvant TLR8 activity in T cells can contribute to viral dissemination in the lymph node and lowgrade inflammation in HIV patients. In addition, it can potentially be exploited for therapeutic targeting and vaccine development. Manipulation of Tolllike receptors (TLRs) affects HIV1 infection and latency reversal. Here, the authors show that HIV1 is endocytosed and recognized by TLR8 in human primary CD4T cells and that TLR8 stimulation induces an inflammatory response that promotes HIV1 replication and reversal of latency.",Hany Zekaria Meas; Markus Haug; Marianne Sandvold Beckwith; Claire Louet; Liv Ryan; Zhenyi Hu; Johannes Landskron; Svein Arne Nordb; Kjetil Tasken; Hang Yin; Jan Kristian Damas; Trude Helen Flo,Adaptive immunity; Cell biology; Cell signalling; Immunology; Mechanisms of disease,"Centre of Molecular Inflammation Research, Department of Clinical and Molecular Medicine, Norwegian University of Science and Technology, Trondheim, Norway; Department of Infectious Diseases, St. Olavs Hospital, Trondheim, Norway; Centre of Molecular Inflammation Research, Department of Clinical and Molecular Medicine, Norwegian University of Science and Technology, Trondheim, Norway; Department of Infectious Diseases, St. Olavs Hospital, Trondheim, Norway; Centre of Molecular Inflammation Research, Department of Clinical and Molecular Medicine, Norwegian University of Science and Technology, Trondheim, Norway; Centre of Molecular Inflammation Research, Department of Clinical and Molecular Medicine, Norwegian University of Science and Technology, Trondheim, Norway; Centre of Molecular Inflammation Research, Department of Clinical and Molecular Medicine, Norwegian University of Science and Technology, Trondheim, Norway; School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Tsinghua UniversityPeking University Joint Center for Life Sciences, Beijing Advanced Innovation Center for Structural Biology, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China; Centre for Molecular Medicine Norway, Nordic EMBL Partnership, University of Oslo and Oslo University Hospital, Oslo, Norway; Centre for Molecular Medicine Norway, Nordic EMBL Partnership, University of Oslo and Oslo University Hospital, Oslo, Norway; Centre of Molecular Inflammation Research, Department of Clinical and Molecular Medicine, Norwegian University of Science and Technology, Trondheim, Norway; Department of Medical Microbiology, St. Olavs Hospital, Trondheim, Norway; Centre for Molecular Medicine Norway, Nordic EMBL Partnership, University of Oslo and Oslo University Hospital, Oslo, Norway; Department of Cancer Immunology, Institute of Cancer Research, Oslo University Hospital, Oslo, Norway; K.G.

Such exquisite boundary architecture is demonstrated to be capable of regulating the mechanical stress and concentration of oxygen deficiency for desired performance. Consequently, significantly improved electronic conductivity and enlarged lithium ion diffusion path, shortened activation process and better structural stability are realized in the designed Ti2Nb10O29xC composites. The optimized Ti2Nb10O29xC composite electrode shows fast chargingdischarging capability with a high capacity of 197 mA h g1 at 20 C (3 min) and excellent longterm durability with 98.7% electron and Li capacity retention over 500 cycles.

Here we show that astrocytes detect falling cerebral perfusion pressure and activate CNS autonomic sympathetic control circuits to increase systemic arterial blood pressure and heart rate with the purpose of maintaining brain blood flow and oxygen delivery. Studies conducted in experimental animals (laboratory rats) show that astrocytes respond to acute decreases in brain perfusion with elevations in intracellular Ca2]. Blockade of Ca2dependent signaling mechanisms in populations of astrocytes that reside alongside CNS sympathetic control circuits prevents compensatory increases in sympathetic nerve activity, heart rate and arterial blood pressure induced by reductions in cerebral perfusion. These data suggest that astrocytes function as intracranial baroreceptors and play an important role in homeostatic control of arterial blood pressure and brain blood flow. The brain receives 20% of cardiac output, but in accord with the current knowledge lacks a specialized sensor of its own blood flow.

We characterized the A. viride telomere sequence as being composed of TTAGGG repeats and identifyied the telomerase gene Avitert. In adult A. viride, telomerase was constantly active and telomere lengths were similar among different body sections and stably maintained with age. Notably, we found that regeneration did not result in telomere shortening at regenerating sites. Moreover, transient upregulation of Avitert expression and telomerase activity was observed at regenerating sites, which might promote telomere lengthening to counteract telomere erosion resulting from cell proliferation. Our study suggests that although aging affects A. viride regeneration independent of steadystate telomere length, timely regulation of telomerase functions is critical for the regeneration process in A. viride.",ChiFan Chen; TzuLing Sung; LiuhYow Chen; JiunHong Chen,Molecular evolution; Regeneration; Telomeres,"Department of Life Science, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan; Institute of Molecular Biology, Academia Sinica, Taipei, Taiwan; Institute of Molecular Biology, Academia Sinica, Taipei, Taiwan; Department of Life Science, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"

In contrast, nature has already developed efficient networks that can instigate rapid response and consensus when key elements are stimulated. We present a technique for identifying these key elements by investigating the relationships between a system's most dominant eigenvectors. This approach reveals the most effective vertices for leading a network to rapid consensus when stimulated, as well as the communities that form under their dynamical influence. In applying this technique, the effectiveness of starling flocks was found to be due, in part, to the low outdegree of every bird, where increasing the number of outgoing connections can produce a less responsive flock. A larger outdegree also affects the location of the birds with the most influence, where these influentially connected birds become more centrally located and in a poorer position to observe a predator and, hence, instigate an evasion manoeuvre. Finally, the technique was found to be effective in large voxelwise brain connectomes where subjects can be identified from their influential communities.",Ruaridh Clark; Giuliano Punzo; Malcolm Macdonald,Applied mathematics; Computer science; Engineering,"Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering, University of Strathclyde, Glasgow, United Kingdom; Department of Automatic Control and Systems, University of Sheffield, Sheffield, United Kingdom; Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering, University of Strathclyde, Glasgow, United Kingdom"

We have developed photonic circuits operating in the blue spectral range based on microdisks and bus waveguides in IIInitride on silicon. We report on the interplay between microdiskwaveguide coupling and its optical properties. We observe critical coupling and phase matching, i.e. the most efficient energy transfer scheme, for very short gap sizes and thin waveguides (g  45 nm and w  170 nm) in the spontaneous emission regime. Whispering gallery mode lasing is demonstrated for a wide range of parameters with a strong dependence of the threshold on the loaded quality factor. We show the dependence and high sensitivity of the output signal on the coupling. Lastly, we observe the impact of processing on the tuning of mode resonances due to the very short coupling distances.

We attempt to subgroup HER2 tumors based on amplicon structures and coamplified genes. We examined five HER2 cell lines, three HER2 xenographs and 57 HER2 tumor tissues. ERBB2 amplification was analyzed using digital droplet PCR and low coverage whole genome sequencing. In some HER2 tumors PPM1D, that encodes WIP1, is coamplified. Cell lines were treated with HER2 and WIP1 inhibitors. We find that inverted duplication is the amplicon structure in the majority of HER2 tumors. In patients suffering from an early stage disease the ERBB2 amplicon is composed of a single segment while in patients suffering from advanced cancer the amplicon is composed of several different segments. We find robust WIP1 inhibition in some HER2 PPM1D amplified cell lines. Subgrouping HER2 tumors using low coverage whole genome sequencing identifies inverted duplications as the main amplicon structure and based on the number of segments, differentiates between local and advanced tumors. In addition, we found that we could determine if a tumor is a recurrent tumor or second primary tumor and identify coamplified oncogenes that may serve as targets for therapy.",Myriam Maoz; Michal Devir; Michal Inbar; Ziva InbarDaniel; Dana SherillRofe; Idit Bloch; Karen Meir; David Edelman; Salah Azzam; Hovav Nechushtan; Ofra Maimon; Beatrice Uziely; Luna Kadouri; Amir Sonnenblick; Amir Eden; Tamar Peretz; Aviad Zick,Cancer genomics; Oncogenes,"Sharett Institute of Oncology, Hebrew UniversityHadassah Medical Center, Jerusalem, Israel; Sharett Institute of Oncology, Hebrew UniversityHadassah Medical Center, Jerusalem, Israel; Sharett Institute of Oncology, Hebrew UniversityHadassah Medical Center, Jerusalem, Israel; Sharett Institute of Oncology, Hebrew UniversityHadassah Medical Center, Jerusalem, Israel; Sharett Institute of Oncology, Hebrew UniversityHadassah Medical Center, Jerusalem, Israel; Sharett Institute of Oncology, Hebrew UniversityHadassah Medical Center, Jerusalem, Israel; Department of Pathology, Hebrew UniversityHadassah Medical Center, Jerusalem, Israel; Sharett Institute of Oncology, Hebrew UniversityHadassah Medical Center, Jerusalem, Israel; Sharett Institute of Oncology, Hebrew UniversityHadassah Medical Center, Jerusalem, Israel; Sharett Institute of Oncology, Hebrew UniversityHadassah Medical Center, Jerusalem, Israel; Sharett Institute of Oncology, Hebrew UniversityHadassah Medical Center, Jerusalem, Israel; Sharett Institute of Oncology, Hebrew UniversityHadassah Medical Center, Jerusalem, Israel; Sharett Institute of Oncology, Hebrew UniversityHadassah Medical Center, Jerusalem, Israel; The Oncology Division, Tel Aviv Sourasky Medical Center, Tel Aviv, Israel; Department of Cell  Developmental Biology, Institute of Life Sciences, The Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Edmond J.

The specificity of an antibody is therefore its most important feature. However, it is very difficult to confirm antibody specificity. Recently, we made a human protein array consisting of 19,712 kinds of recombinant human proteins produced by a wheat cellfree protein production system. Here, we demonstrate a novel protein array technology for antibody validation (CFPA2Vtech). Fulllength human cDNAs were fused to Nterminal FLAGGST and then synthesized by the wheat cellfree system. To construct a 20 K human protein array, about 10 to 14 kinds of human proteins were mixed and captured in each well by glutathioneconjugated magnetic beads in 12 plates or one plate with 384 or 1536well format, respectively, using a strong magnetic device. Using this protein array plate, commercially available antiHA or antiPD1 antibody reacted to 13 or three human proteins, respectively. The crossreactivity of these proteins was also confirmed by immunoblotting. These proteins have a similar epitope, and alanine mutations of these epitope candidates dissolved the reactivity. These results indicated that CFPA2Vtech is very useful for validation of antibodies against human protein.",Ryo Morishita; Shusei Sugiyama; Miwako Denda; Soh Tokunaga; Kohki Kido; Ryouhei Shioya; Satoshi Ozawa; Tatsuya Sawasaki,Assay systems; Blood proteins,"CellFree Sciences.

In recent years, their wild resources are gradually exhausted due to overcollection and ecological deterioration. Artificial cultivation and tissue culture are employed to increase production. In this study, the open reading frame, promoter and genomic sequences of the chalcone synthase (CHS) gene were cloned from these two species according to their transcriptome information, and used for expression analysis in response to the induction of phenylalanine, ultraviolet light and NaCl, and its effect investigation on accumulation of flavonoids. The results showed that the expression of the CHS genes was upregulated in response to these inductions and resulted in increasing accumulation of total flavonoids. However, the increased flavonoids induced by phenylalanine and ultraviolet light were mainly allocated into the anthocyanidin branch of flavonoids biosynthesis. Not only did it improved the medicinal value, but might have inhibitory effect on plant growth because of the increased malondialdehyde accumulation. Under the induction of appropriate concentration of NaCl, the medicinal constituents of flavonoids were increased without inhibition to plant growth.",Lin Yang; Jun Cheng Zhang; Jing Tao Qu; Gang He; Hao Qiang Yu; Wan Chen Li; Feng Ling Fu,Gene expression; Plant physiology,"Maize Research Institute, Sichuan Agricultural University, Chengdu, PR China; Medical Plant Exploitation and Utilization Engineering Research Center, Fujian Province University, Sanming University, Sanming, People's Republic of China; Medical Plant Exploitation and Utilization Engineering Research Center, Fujian Province University, Sanming University, Sanming, People's Republic of China; Maize Research Institute, Sichuan Agricultural University, Chengdu, PR China; Key Laboratory of Medicinal and Edible Plants Resources Development of Sichuan Education Department, Sichuan Industrial Institute of Antibiotics, Chengdu University, Chengdu, PR China; Maize Research Institute, Sichuan Agricultural University, Chengdu, PR China; Maize Research Institute, Sichuan Agricultural University, Chengdu, PR China; Maize Research Institute, Sichuan Agricultural University, Chengdu, PR China"

SSCAM is a unique synaptic scaffolding protein that localizes to both excitatory and GABAergic synapses. However, consequences of aberrant SSCAM expression on GABAergic synapses is little studied. Here we report the effect of SSCAM knockdown and overexpression on GABAergic synapses. SSCAM knockdown in cultured hippocampal neurons caused a drastic loss of both pre and postsynaptic components of GABAergic synapses, indicating its essential role in GABAergic synapse formation and maintenance. Surprisingly, SSCAM overexpression also attenuated GABAergic synapses, but the effect is mediated by the loss of postsynaptic GABAA receptors, gephyrin, and neuroligin 2 and does not involve presynaptic component vesicular GABA transporters. Overexpression studies using SSCAM mutants with various domain deletions indicated that GABAergic synapse loss correlates with their ability to increase excitatory synaptic function. Consistently, AMPA receptor antagonist CNQX or calcineurin inhibitor FK506 abolished the SSCAM overexpressioninduced loss of GABAA receptors, supporting that GABAergic synapse loss by SSCAM overexpression is due to the activityinduced dispersal of synaptic GABAA receptors. These results suggest that abnormal SSCAM protein levels disrupt excitationinhibition balance in neurons, which may explain the pathogenic nature of SSCAM copy number variations.",Seung Min Shin; Samantha Skaar; Eric Danielson; Sang H.

An ophthalmological assessment in all families was followed by targeted MFRP and PRSS56 testing in 20 families and wholegenome sequencing in one family. Three families underwent homozygosity mapping using SNP arrays. Eight distinct MFRP mutations were found in 1021 families (47.6%), five of which are novel including a deletion spanning the 5 untranslated region and the first coding part of exon 1. Most cases harbored homozygous mutations (810), while a compound heterozygous and a monoallelic genotype were identified in the remaining ones (210). Six distinct PRSS56 mutations were found in 921 (42.9%) families, three of which are novel. Similarly, homozygous mutations were found in all but one, leaving 221 families (9.5%) without a molecular diagnosis. Clinically, all patients had reduced visual acuity, hyperopia, short axial length and crowded optic discs. Retinitis pigmentosa was observed in 510 (50%) of the MFRP group, papillomacular folds in 1219 (63.2%) of MCOP and in 36 (50%) of NNO cases. A considerable phenotypic variability was observed, with no clear genotypephenotype correlations. Overall, our study represents the largest NNO and MCOP cohort reported to date and provides a genetic diagnosis in 1921 families (90.5%), including the first MFRP genomic rearrangement, offering opportunities for genebased therapies in MFRPassociated disease.

Curling is reversible and involves hierarchical deformation, making S. lepidophylla an attractive model with which to study waterresponsive actuation. Investigation at the organ and tissue level has led to the understanding that the direction and extent of stem curling can be partially attributed to stiffness gradients between adaxial and abaxial stem sides at the nanoscale. Here, we examine cell wall elasticity to understand how it contributes to the overall stem curling. We compare the measured elastic moduli along the stem length and between adaxial and abaxial stem sides using atomic force microscopy nanoindentation testing. We show that changes in cortex secondary cell wall development lead to cell wall stiffness gradients from stem tip to base, and also between adaxial and abaxial stem sides.

The purpose of this systematic literature review is to comprehensively investigate the birth season and female fertility relationship. Using PubMed, we identified a set of 282 relevant fertilitybirth season papers published between 1972 and 2018. We screened all 282 studies and removed 131 nonmammalian species studies on fertility and 122 studies that were on nonhuman mammals. Our metaanalysis focused on the remaining 29 human studies, including twelve human datasets from around the world (USA, Europe, Asia). The main outcome was change in female fertility as observed by maternal birth month and whether this change was correlated with either temperature or rainfall. We found that temperature was either strongly correlated or anticorrelated in studies, indicating that another factor closely tied to temperature may be the culprit exposure. We found that rainfall only increases fertility in higher altitude locations (New Zealand, Romania, and Northern Vietnam). This suggests the possibility of a combined or multifactorial mechanism underlying the female fertility  birth season relationship. We discuss other environmental and sociological factors on the birth season  female fertility relationship. Future research should focus on the role of birth season and female fertility adjusting for additional factors that modulate female fertility as discussed in this comprehensive review.",Mary Regina Boland; Martin Fieder; Luis H.

Both opportunities are predicated on proactive generation of human molecular profiles that capture longitudinal trajectories before and after pharmacological intervention. Here, we present the largest plasma proteomic biomarker dataset available todate and the corresponding analyses from placebocontrolled Phase III clinical trials of the phosphodiesterase type 4 inhibitor apremilast in psoriasis (PSOR), psoriatic arthritis (PsA), and ankylosing spondylitis (AS) from 526 subjects overall. Using approximately 150 plasma analytes tracked across three time points, we identified IL17A and KLK7 as biomarkers for disease severity and apremilast pharmacodynamic effect in psoriasis patients. Combined decline rate of KLK7, PEDF, MDC and ANGPTL4 by Week 16 represented biomarkers for the responder subgroup, shedding insights into therapeutic mechanisms. In ankylosing spondylitis patients, IL6 and LRG1 were identified as biomarkers with concordance to disease severity. Apremilastinduced LRG1 increase was consistent with the overall lack of efficacy in ankylosing spondylitis.

764691d4d9d24153b25a1b9b5f121e57,Nitrogen Fertilization Restructured Spatial Patterns of Soil Organic Carbon and Total Nitrogen in Switchgrass and Gamagrass Croplands in Tennessee USA,"Nitrogen (N) fertilizers can potentially alter spatial distribution of soil organic carbon (SOC) and total nitrogen (TN)  concentrations in croplands such as switchgrass (SG: Panicum virgatum L.) and gamagrass (GG: Tripsacum dactyloides L.), but it remains unclear whether these effects are the same between crops and under different rates of fertilization. 13C and 15N are  two important proxy measures of soil biogeochemistry, but they were rarely examined as to their spatial distributions in soil. Based on a threeyear long fertilization experiment in Middle Tennessee, USA, the top mineral horizon soils (015 cm) were collected using a spatially explicit design within two 15m2 plots under three fertilization treatments in SG and GG croplands. A total of 288 samples were collected based on 12 plots and 24 samples in each plot. The fertilization treatments were no N input (NN), low N input (LN: 84 kg N ha1 in urea) and high N input (HN: 168 kg N ha1 in urea). The SOC, TN, SOCTN (C: N), 13C and 15N were quantified and their withinplot variations and spatial distributions were achieved via descriptive and geostatistical methods. Results showed that SG generally displayed 10~120% higher plotlevel variations in all variables than GG, and the plotlevel variations were 20~77% higher in NN plots than LN and HN plots in SG but they were comparable in unfertilized and fertilized plots in GG. Relative to NN, LN and HN showed more significant surface trends and spatial structures in SOC and TN in both croplands, and the fertilization effect appeared more pronounced in SG. Spatial patterns in C: N, 13C and 15N were comparable among different fertilization treatments in both croplands. The descending withinplot variations were also identified among variables (SOC  TN  15N  C: N  13C). This study demonstrated that N fertilizations generally reduced the plotlevel variance and simultaneously reestablished spatial structures of SOC and TN in bioenergy croplands, which little varied with fertilization rate but was more responsive in switchgrass cropland.",Jianwei Li; Siyang Jian; Chad S.

If this is not possible, some authors suggest milking as an alternative. The objective of this study was to determine the variability in professional practice in the management of umbilical cord clamping and milking and to identify factors or circumstances associated with the different methods. An observational crosssectional study done on 1,045 obstetrics professionals in Spain in 2018. A selfdesigned questionnaire was administered online. The main variables studied were type of clamping and use of milking. Crude odds ratios (OR) and adjusted odds ratios (ORa) were estimated using binary logistic regression. 92.2% (964) performed delayed clamping. 69.3% (724) clamped the cord when it stopped beating. 83.8% (876) had heard of milking, and 55.9% (584) had never performed it. Professionals over 50 were less likely to perform delayed clamping, with an ORa of 0.24 (95% CI: 0.110.52), while midwives were more likely to perform delayed clamping than obstetricians, with an ORa of 14.05 (95% CI: 8.4123.49).

To understand stem cell differentiation along multiple lineages, it is necessary to resolve heterogeneous cellular states and the ancestral relationships between them. We developed a robotic miniaturized CELSeq2 implementation to carry out deep singlecell RNAseq of 2,000 mouse hematopoietic progenitors enriched for lymphoid lineages, and used an improved clustering algorithm, RaceID3, to identify cell types. To resolve subtle transcriptome differences indicative of lineage biases, we developed FateID, an iterative supervised learning algorithm for the probabilistic quantification of cell fate bias in progenitor populations.

Despite improvement in survival for most patients with multiple myeloma over recent decades, outcomes are generally poor when EMM develops. Understanding the molecular underpinnings leading to homing of plasma cells in ecosystems outside the bone marrow will be crucial for therapeutically manipulating the microenvironment and targeting key signaling pathways.

The challenge is compounded by overlapping expression of epithelial or melanocytic markers in some of these entities. A broad spectrum of primary cutaneous epithelioid soft tissue tumors exists, including benign and malignant counterparts of tumors with various differentiation including melanocytic, peripheral nerve sheath, angiomatous, fibrohistiocytic, and myoid or myoepithelial, in addition to translocationassociated tumors lacking a derivative tissue type. Given this spectrum, an initial targeted immunohistochemical panel for epithelioid dermal and subcutaneous neoplasms is recommended, covering a broad spectrum of differentiation. In diagnostically challenging cases, select molecular studies can be employed to make critical distinctions between entities sharing morphologic and immunohistochemical properties. Due to sometimes marked differences in prognosis and treatment, knowledge and familiarity with epithelioid soft tissue tumors is key for any surgical pathologist who evaluates skin and subcutaneous biopsies and excision specimens. This concise review provides brief descriptions, key diagnostic features, and important modern ancillary studies for the diagnosis of nonepithelial, nonmelanocytic cutaneous tumors that can exhibit a prominent degree of epithelioid morphology.",Cody S.

Although prior work has identified susceptibility loci associated with various dementias, few, if any, studies have systematically evaluated shared genetic risk across several neurodegenerative diseases. Using genomewide association data from large studies (total n  82,337 cases and controls), we utilized a previously validated approach to identify genetic overlap and reveal common pathways between progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), frontotemporal dementia (FTD), Parkinson's disease (PD) and Alzheimer's disease (AD). In addition to the MAPT H1 haplotype, we identified a variant near the chemokine receptor CXCR4 that was jointly associated with increased risk for PSP and PD. Using bioinformatics tools, we found strong physical interactions between CXCR4 and four microglia related genes, namely CXCL12, TLR2, RALB, and CCR5. Evaluating gene expression from postmortem brain tissue, we found that expression of CXCR4 and microglial genes functionally related to CXCR4 was dysregulated across a number of neurodegenerative diseases. Furthermore, in a mouse model of tauopathy, expression of CXCR4 and functionally associated genes was significantly altered in regions of the mouse brain that accumulate neurofibrillary tangles most robustly. Beyond MAPT, we show dysregulation of CXCR4 expression in PSP, PD, and FTD brains, and mouse models of tau pathology. Our multimodal findings suggest that abnormal signaling across a 'network' of microglial genes may contribute to neurodegeneration and may have potential implications for clinical trials targeting immune dysfunction in patients with neurodegenerative diseases.",Luke W.

6c182d36f2fd40ac9d9317d1ac31c4ce,Neuromelanin organelles are specialized autolysosomes that accumulate undegraded proteins and lipids in aging human brain and are likely involved in Parkinson's disease,"During aging, neuronal organelles filled with neuromelanin (a darkbrown pigment) and lipid bodies accumulate in the brain, particularly in the substantia nigra, a region targeted in Parkinson's disease. We have investigated protein and lipid systems involved in the formation of these organelles and in the synthesis of the neuromelanin of human substantia nigra. Membrane and matrix proteins characteristic of lysosomes were found in neuromelanincontaining organelles at a lower number than in typical lysosomes, indicating a reduced enzymatic activity and likely impaired capacity for lysosomal and autophagosomal fusion. The presence of proteins involved in lipid transport may explain the accumulation of lipid bodies in the organelle and the lipid component in neuromelanin structure. The major lipids observed in lipid bodies of the organelle are dolichols with lower amounts of other lipids. Proteins of aggregation and degradation pathways were present, suggesting a role for accumulation by this organelle when the ubiquitinproteasome system is inadequate. The presence of proteins associated with aging and storage diseases may reflect impaired autophagic degradation or impaired function of lysosomal enzymes. The identification of typical autophagy proteins and double membranes demonstrates the organelle's autophagic nature and indicates that it has engulfed neuromelanin precursors from the cytosol. Based on these data, it appears that the neuromelanincontaining organelle has a very slow turnover during the life of a neuron and represents an intracellular compartment of final destination for numerous molecules not degraded by other systems. Subcellular compartments in the brain that contain a dark brown pigment, known as neuromelanin, function like a warehouse for a broad array of molecules not degraded by other cellular cleanup systems. Luigi Zecca from the National Research Council of Italy and colleagues characterized all of the proteins and lipid molecules found inside neuromelanincontaining organelles of the substantia nigra, a region of the human brain that is lost in Parkinson's disease. They identified many proteins involved in the breakdown of molecules  a sign that this organelle is a degradative organelle known as an autolysosome. Interestingly, the number of these proteins was lower than in a typical lysosome, suggestive of impaired degradative ability. The authors conclude that these neuromelanincontaining organelles accumulate pigment, lipids, proteins, and other compounds over the lifetime of a neuron, possibly leading to cellular dysfunction and disease.",Fabio A.

The realization of the advantage often requires the ability to load classical data efficiently into quantum states. However, the best known methods require {\mathcal{O}}\left({2}^{n}\right) gates to load an exact representation of a generic data structure into an nqubit state. This scaling can easily predominate the complexity of a quantum algorithm and, thereby, impair potential quantum advantage. Our work presents a hybrid quantumclassical algorithm for efficient, approximate quantum state loading. More precisely, we use quantum Generative Adversarial Networks (qGANs) to facilitate efficient learning and loading of generic probability distributions  implicitly given by data samples  into quantum states. Through the interplay of a quantum channel, such as a variational quantum circuit, and a classical neural network, the qGAN can learn a representation of the probability distribution underlying the data samples and load it into a quantum state. The loading requires {\mathcal{O}}\left(poly\left(n\right)\right) gates and can thus enable the use of potentially advantageous quantum algorithms, such as Quantum Amplitude Estimation. We implement the qGAN distribution learning and loading method with Qiskit and test it using a quantum simulation as well as actual quantum processors provided by the IBM Q Experience. Furthermore, we employ quantum simulation to demonstrate the use of the trained quantum channel in a quantum finance application.",Christa Zoufal; Aurelien Lucchi; Stefan Woerner,Computer science; Information theory and computation; Quantum information,"IBM Research  Zurich, Rueschlikon, Switzerland; ETH Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland; ETH Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland; IBM Research  Zurich, Rueschlikon, Switzerland"

Representatives of the Asgard candidate phylum Candidatus Lokiarchaeota (Lokiarchaeon) have the capacity for acetogenesis and fermentation57, but how their metabolic activity responds to environmental conditions is poorly understood. Here, we show that in anoxic Namibian shelf sediments, Lokiarchaeon gene expression levels are higher than those of bacterial phyla and increase with depth below the seafloor. Lokiarchaeon gene expression was significantly different across a hypoxicsulfidic redox gradient, whereby genes involved in growth, fermentation and H2dependent carbon fixation had the highest expression under the most reducing (sulfidic) conditions. Quantitative stable isotope probing revealed that anaerobic utilization of CO2 and diatomaceous extracellular polymeric substances by Lokiarchaeon was higher than the bacterial average, consistent with higher expression of Lokiarchaeon genes, including those involved in transport and fermentation of sugars and amino acids. The quantitative stable isotope probing and gene expression data demonstrate homoacetogenic activity of Candidatus Lokiarchaeota, whereby fermentative H2 production from organic substrates is coupled with the WoodLjungdahl carbon fixation pathway8. The high energetic efficiency provided by homoacetogenesis8 helps to explain the elevated metabolic activity of Lokiarchaeon in this anoxic, energylimited setting. Quantitative stable isotope probing and gene expression analyses in anoxic Namibian shelf sediments reveal that representatives of the Asgard candidate phylum Candidatus Lokiarchaeota are capable of homoacetogenesis, a metabolic strategy of high energetic efficiency that may explain how these archaea thrive in the energylimited seafloor subsurface environment.",William D.

Although multiple scaffolds have been or are in development, the Absorb Bioresorbable Vascular Scaffold (BVS; Abbott Vascular) was the first FDAapproved device and was widely expected to fulfil the dream of interventional cardiologists of a transient scaffold that would disappear 'when the job was done' and would not hamper further treatment options. Although early, small studies and even large, randomized trials showed beneficial outcomes up to 1 year of followup, longerterm results have been disappointing, with increased rates of device thrombosis and targetlesion revascularization. The Absorb BVS device was withdrawn from the market because of low demand. In this Review, we summarize the preclinical and clinical data available for BRS to understand how the vascular biological reactions to these devices differ from biological reactions to metallic drugeluting stents and how these responses translate into clinical outcomes. We also discuss nextgeneration BRS and outline modifications that are needed to improve the longterm outcomes with these devices so that they eventually become a viable option for patients with symptomatic obstructive coronary artery disease. Fully bioresorbable scaffolds (BRS) were designed to overcome the limitations of metallic drugeluting stents, but longterm results with these devices have been disappointing. In this Review, the authors discuss the available preclinical and clinical data for BRS and how this information can inform the development of nextgeneration BRS.

The receptor architecture reveals unique heteromeric interactions for this important class of inhibitory neurotransmitter receptor. This work provides a template for understanding receptor modulation by GABA and benzodiazepines, and will assist rational approaches to therapeutic targeting of this receptor for neurological disorders and mental illness.

fa3cd86c516d4249a657b331e37af580,Datadriven design of metalorganic frameworks for wet flue gas CO 2 capture,"Limiting the increase of CO2 in the atmosphere is one of the largest challenges of our generation1. Because carbon capture and storage is one of the few viable technologies that can mitigate current CO2 emissions2, much effort is focused on developing solid adsorbents that can efficiently capture CO2 from flue gases emitted from anthropogenic sources3. One class of materials that has attracted considerable interest in this context is metalorganic frameworks (MOFs), in which the careful combination of organic ligands with metalion nodes can, in principle, give rise to innumerable structurally and chemically distinct nanoporous MOFs. However, many MOFs that are optimized for the separation of CO2 from nitrogen47 do not perform well when using realistic flue gas that contains water, because water competes with CO2 for the same adsorption sites and thereby causes the materials to lose their selectivity. Although flue gases can be dried, this renders the capture process prohibitively expensive8,9. Here we show that data mining of a computational screening library of over 300,000 MOFs can identify different classes of strong CO2binding siteswhich we term 'adsorbaphores'that endow MOFs with CO2N2 selectivity that persists in wet flue gases. We subsequently synthesized two waterstable MOFs containing the most hydrophobic adsorbaphore, and found that their carboncapture performance is not affected by water and outperforms that of some commercial materials. Testing the performance of these MOFs in an industrial setting and consideration of the full capture processincluding the targeted CO2 sink, such as geological storage or serving as a carbon source for the chemical industrywill be necessary to identify the optimal separation material. Data mining of a computational library of metalorganic frameworks identifies motifs that bind CO2 sufficiently strongly and whose uptake is not affected by water, with application for the capture of CO2 from flue gases.",Peter G.

52742dc39c714eb1a8cc39fdf33fe58e,FACT caught in the act of manipulating the nucleosome,"The organization of genomic DNA into nucleosomes profoundly affects all DNArelated processes in eukaryotes. The histone chaperone known as 'facilitates chromatin transcription' (FACT1) (consisting of subunits SPT16 and SSRP1) promotes both disassembly and reassembly of nucleosomes during gene transcription, DNA replication and DNA repair2. However, the mechanism by which FACT causes these opposing outcomes is unknown. Here we report two cryoelectronmicroscopic structures of human FACT in complex with partially assembled subnucleosomes, with supporting biochemical and hydrogendeuterium exchange data. We find that FACT is engaged in extensive interactions with nucleosomal DNA and all histone variants. The large DNAbinding surface on FACT appears to be protected by the carboxyterminal domains of both of its subunits, and this inhibition is released by interaction with H2AH2B, allowing FACTH2AH2B to dock onto a complex containing DNA and histones H3 and H4 (ref. 3). SPT16 binds nucleosomal DNA and tethers H2AH2B through its carboxyterminal domain by acting as a placeholder for DNA. SSRP1 also contributes to DNA binding, and can assume two conformations, depending on whether a second H2AH2B dimer is present. Our data suggest a compelling mechanism for how FACT maintains chromatin integrity during polymerase passage, by facilitating removal of the H2AH2B dimer, stabilizing intermediate subnucleosomal states and promoting nucleosome reassembly. Our findings reconcile discrepancies regarding the many roles of FACT and underscore the dynamic interactions between histone chaperones and nucleosomes. Two cryoelectronmicroscopy images of the histone chaperone FACT interacting with components of nucleosomes shed light on how FACT manipulates nucleosomes to promote transcription, DNA repair and DNA replication.",Yang Liu; Keda Zhou; Naifu Zhang; Hui Wei; Yong Zi Tan; Zhening Zhang; Bridget Carragher; Clinton S.

While this framework has been highly influential, a critical shortcoming for its application in sustainability governance is that it currently fails to represent how impacts related to one of the planetary boundaries affect the status of other planetary boundaries. Here, we surveyed and provisionally quantified interactions between the Earth system processes represented by the planetary boundaries and investigated their consequences for sustainability governance. We identified a dense network of interactions between the planetary boundaries. The resulting cascades and feedbacks predominantly amplify human impacts on the Earth system and thereby shrink the safe operating space for future human impacts on the Earth system. Our results show that an integrated understanding of Earth system dynamics is critical to navigating towards a sustainable future.

e075ddf8976e4582bbec3ca4a5b5dcdb,Energytemperature uncertainty relation in quantum thermodynamics,"It is known that temperature estimates of macroscopic systems in equilibrium are most precise when their energy fluctuations are large. However, for nanoscale systems deviations from standard thermodynamics arise due to their interactions with the environment. Here we include such interactions and, using quantum estimation theory, derive a generalised thermodynamic uncertainty relation valid for classical and quantum systems at all coupling strengths. We show that the noncommutativity between the system's state and its effective energy operator gives rise to quantum fluctuations that increase the temperature uncertainty. Surprisingly, these additional fluctuations are described by the average WignerYanaseDyson skew information. We demonstrate that the temperature's signaltonoise ratio is constrained by the heat capacity plus a dissipative term arising from the nonnegligible interactions. These findings shed light on the interplay between classical and nonclassical fluctuations in quantum thermodynamics and will inform the design of optimal nanoscale thermometers. The energytemperature uncertainty relation bounds the precision of simultaneously estimating energy and temperature of a system in equilibrium.

We apply IsoCon to nine Y chromosome ampliconic gene families and show that it outperforms existing methods on both experimental and simulated data. IsoCon has allowed us to detect an unprecedented number of novel isoforms and has opened the door for unraveling the structure of many multigene families and gaining a deeper understanding of genome evolution and human diseases. Transcripts from highlysimilar multigene families are challenging to decipher. Here, the authors develop IsoCon, a tool for detecting and reconstructing isoforms from multigene families by analyzing long PacBio IsoSeq reads.",Kristoffer Sahlin; Marta Tomaszkiewicz; Kateryna D.

In Arabidopsis thaliana, AGAMOUS (AG) terminates floral stem cell activities to trigger this transition. Although CRABS CLAW (CRC) is a direct target of AG, previous research has not identified any common targets. Here, we identify an auxin synthesis gene, YUCCA4 (YUC4) as a common direct target. Ectopic YUC4 expression partially rescues the indeterminate phenotype and cell wall defects that are caused by the crc mutation. The feedforward YUC4 activation by AG and CRC directs a precise change in chromatin state for the shift from floral stem cell maintenance to gynoecium formation. We also showed that two auxinrelated direct CRC targets, YUC4 and TORNADO2, cooperatively contribute to the termination of floral stem cell maintenance. This finding provides new insight into the CRCmediated auxin homeostasis regulation for proper gynoecium formation. In Arabidopsis, the AG and CRC transcription factors terminate floral stem cells and allow the emergence of female floral organs. Here the authors show that AG and CRC form a feedforward loop that controls local auxin biosynthesis via induction of YUCCA4 to ensure successful gynoecium formation.",Nobutoshi Yamaguchi; Jiangbo Huang; Yoshitaka Tatsumi; Masato Abe; Shigeo S.

A fraction of the transcripts is oligoadenylated by TRAMP and either processed into the mature hTR or degraded by the exosome. Here, we characterize the processing of 3 extended forms of varying length by PARN and RRP6. We show that tertiary RNA interactions unique to the longer transcripts favor RNA degradation, whereas HACA RNP assembly stimulates productive processing. Interestingly, the HACA complex actively promotes processing in addition to protecting the mature 3 end. Processing occurs in two steps with longer forms first being trimmed by RRP6 and shorter forms then being processed by PARN. These results reveal how RNA structure and RNP assembly affect the kinetics of processing and degradation and ultimately determine the amount of functional telomerase produced in cells. Telomerase RNA (hTR) is transcribed as a 3extended precursor.

Many current implementations of cellular computing are based on the ""genetic circuit"" metaphor, an approximation of the operation of siliconbased computers. Although this conceptual mapping has been relatively successful, we argue that it fundamentally limits the types of computation that may be engineered inside the cell, and fails to exploit the rich and diverse functionality available in natural living systems. We propose the notion of ""cellular supremacy"" to focus attention on domains in which biocomputing might offer superior performance over traditional computers. We consider potential pathways toward cellular supremacy, and suggest application areas in which it may be found. Synthetic biology uses cells as its computing substrate, often based on the genetic circuit concept. In this Perspective, the authors argue that existing synthetic biology approaches based on classical models of computation limit the potential of biocomputing, and propose that living organisms have underexploited capabilities.",Lewis Grozinger; Martyn Amos; Thomas E.

Recently, it has been demonstrated that the allogeneic immune response might be influenced by external factors such as tissues microenvironment or host microbiota. Here we used high throughput metabolomics to analyze two cohorts of genotypically HLAidentical related recipient and donor pairs. Metabolomic profiles markedly differ between recipients and donors. At the onset of acute GvHD, in addition to hostderived metabolites, we identify significant variation in microbiotaderived metabolites, especially in aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) ligands, bile acids and plasmalogens. Altogether, our findings support that the allogeneic immune response during acute GvHD might be influenced by bile acids and by the decreased production of AhR ligands by microbiota that could limit indoleamine 2,3dioxygenase induction and influence allogeneic T cell reactivity. Graft versus host disease (GvHD) still hinders allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.

From this perspective, we can construct models in which unitary behavioural modules are hierarchically placed in context of related actions. Here, we analyse antennal positioning reflex in hawkmoths as a tuneable behavioural unit. Mechanosensory feedback from two antennal structures, Bohm's bristles (BB) and Johnston's organs (JO), determines antennal position. At flight onset, antennae attain a specific position, which is maintained by feedback from BB. Simultaneously, JO senses deflections in flagellumpedicel joint due to frontal airflow, to modulate its steadystate position. Restricting JO abolishes positional modulation but maintains stability against perturbations. Linear feedback models are sufficient to predict antennal dynamics at various setpoints. We modelled antennal positioning as a hierarchical neuralcircuit in which fast BB feedback maintains instantaneous setpoint, but slow JO feedback modulates it, thereby elucidating mechanisms underlying its robustness and flexibility. Flying insects position their antennae by integrating multisensory inputs across different timescales. This study describes an underlying hierarchical neural circuit that maintains antennal position in a fast and robust manner, whilst retaining flexibility to incorporate slower feedback to modulate position.",Dinesh Natesan; Nitesh Saxena; Orjan Ekeberg; Sanjay P.

To better understand mechanisms of multisensory processing we ask whether inputs from two senses (auditory and visual) can interact and drive plasticity in neuralcircuits of the primary visual cortex (V1). Using geneticallyencoded voltage and calcium indicators, we find coincident audiovisual experience modifies both the supra and subthreshold response properties of neurons in L23 of mouse V1. Specifically, we find that after audiovisual pairing, a subset of multimodal neurons develops enhanced auditory responses to the paired auditory stimulus. This crossmodal plasticity persists over days and is reflected in the strengthening of small functional networks of L23 neurons. We find V1 processes coincident auditory and visual events by strengthening functional associations between feature specific assemblies of multimodal neurons during bouts of sensory driven coactivity, leaving a trace of multisensory experience in the cortical network. Sensory stimuli usually arrive simultaneously but the neuralcircuit mechanisms that combine multiple streams of sensory information are incompletely understood. The authors here show that visualauditory pairing drives plasticity in multimodal neuron networks within the mouse visual cortex.",Thomas Knopfel; Yann Sweeney; Carola I.

Tumor volume reductions of 20% are observed in two patients, including one in which bevacizumab had not been effective. There are no severe adverse events related to the vaccine. Both VEGFR1specific and VEGFR2specific CTLs are induced in six patients. Surgery is performed after vaccination in two patients, and significant reductions in the expression of VEGFRs in schwannomas are observed.

To demonstrate the utility of this dataset, we deployed a deep learning model for retention time prediction applied to small molecule annotation. Results showed that in 70\% of the cases, the correct molecular identity was ranked among the top 3 candidates based on their predicted retention time. We anticipate that this dataset will enable the community to apply machine learning or first principles strategies to generate better models for retention time prediction.

Assembly of the pilus fiber is driven by a cytoplasmic ATPase: it interacts with an inner membrane complex of biogenesis proteins which, in turn, bind to nascent pilin subunits and mediate fiber assembly. Here we report the structural characterization of the PilF TFP assembly ATPase from Thermus thermophilus. The crystal structure of a recombinant Cterminal fragment of PilF revealed bound, unhydrolysed ATP, although the full length complex was enzymatically active. 3D reconstructions were carried out by single particle cryoelectron microscopy for full length apoprotein PilF and in complex with AMPPNP. The structure forms an hourglasslike shape, with the ATPase domains in one half and the N1 domains in the second half which, we propose, interact with the other pilus biogenesis components. Molecular models for both forms were generated: binding of AMPPNP causes an upward shift of the N1 domains towards the ATPase domains of ~8 A. We advocate a model in which ATP hydrolysis is linked to displacement of the N1 domains which is associated with lifting pilin subunits out of the inner membrane, and provide the activation energy needed to form the pilus fiber.",Richard Collins; Vijaykumar Karuppiah; C.

This work is the first demonstration of the efficient photoinjection of megadalton molecules into a cytoplasm of an intact single plant cell by employing a femtosecond laser amplifier under moderate enzyme treatment conditions. The intense femtosecond laser pulse effectively formed a pore on the cell wall and membrane of Tobacco BY2, and 2 MDa dextran molecules were introduced through the pore.

Subsequently, metabolites and proteins were extracted and measured with mass spectrometrybased techniques. Our results emphasize the importance of certain signal transducer proteins, which showed higher abundances in cells grown under reduced gravity. These proteins activate a cellular signal cascade, which leads to differences in gene expressions.

Templated ordering of 3dimensional space around amorphous embedded nonequilibrium phases at heterogeneous polymermetal interfaces signify important routes for the genesis of lowdimensional materials under stressinduced polymer confinement. We report the surface induced catalytic loss of PO ligands to bond activated aromatization of CC CC and TiN resulting in confinement of porphyrinTiO2 within polymer nanocages via particle attachment. Restricted growth nucleation of TiO2 to the quantum scale (2 nm) is synthetically assisted by nitrogen, phosphine and hydrocarbon polymer chemistry via selfassembly. Here, the amorphous arrest phase of TiO2 is reminiscent of biogenic amorphous crystal growth patterns and polymer coordination has both a chemical and biomimetic significance arising from quantum scale confinement which is atomically challenging. The relative ease in adaptability of nonequilibrium phases renders host structures more shape compliant to congruent guests increasing the possibility of geometrical confinement. Here, we provide evidence for synthetic biomimicry akin to biopolymerization mechanisms to steer disordertoorder transitions via solvent plasticizationlike behaviour. This challenges the rationale of quantum driven confinement processes by conventional processes.

To perform multicolor detection in integrated structures, GaAs PDs were transferred onto InGaAs PDs by using a Y2O3 bonding layer to simultaneously detect visible and nearinfrared photons and minimize the optical loss. As a result, it was found that the GaAs top PD and InGaAs bottom PD were vertically aligned without tilting in xray diffraction (XRD) measurement. A negligible change in the dark currents for each PD was observed in comparison with reference PDs through electrical characterization. Furthermore, through optical measurements and simulation, photoresponses were clearly revealed in the visible and nearinfrared band for the material's absorption region, respectively.

Here, we found that specific inhibition of AURKA by MLN8237induced calpainmediated Bax cleavage at Nterminal 33th asparagine (cBax) to promote apoptosis. The cBax, as Bax, could also efficiently located to mitochondria but cBax is a stronger apoptosis inducer than Bax. Morever, cBaxinduced apoptosis could not be blocked by the canonical Bax inhibitor, Bcl2. Further study found p27 was degraded and subsequently Bax was transformed to cBax through calpain. Also, p27 efficiently inhibited Bax cleavage and p27 knockdown sensitized apoptosis through Bax cleavage when cancer cells were treated with MLN8237. It is also demonstrated that the antiapoptotic role of p27 lies its cytoplasmic localization. Finally, we found that the positive correlation between AURKA and p27 in advanced gastric cancer patients.

1dd1d5ade021492cb50f9cdaafa4fd9b,Covalent ISG15 conjugation to CHIP promotes its ubiquitin E3 ligase activity and inhibits lung cancer cell growth in response to type I interferon,"The carboxyl terminus of Hsp70interacting protein (CHIP) acts as a ubiquitin E3 ligase and a link between the chaperones Hsp7090 and the proteasome system, playing a vital role in maintaining protein homeostasis. CHIP regulates a number of proteins involved in a myriad of physiological and pathological processes, but the underlying mechanism of action via posttranslational modification has not been extensively explored. In this study, we investigated a novel modulatory mode of CHIP and its effect on CHIP enzymatic activity. ISG15, an ubiquitinlike modifier, is induced by type I interferon (IFN) stimulation and can be conjugated to target proteins (ISGylation). Here we demonstrated that CHIP may be a novel target of ISGylation in HEK293 cells stimulated with type I IFN. We also found that Lys143144145 and Lys287 residues in CHIP are important for and target residues of ISGylation. Moreover, ISGylation promotes the E3 ubiquitin ligase activity of CHIP, subsequently causing a decrease in levels of oncogenic cMyc, one of its many ubiquitination targets, in A549 lung cancer cells and inhibiting A549 cell and tumor growth. In conclusion, the present study demonstrates that covalent ISG15 conjugation produces a novel CHIP regulatory mode that enhances the tumorsuppressive activity of CHIP, thereby contributing to the antitumor effect of type I IFN.",Lang Yoo; ARum Yoon; ChaeOk Yun; Kwang Chul Chung,"Life Sciences, general; Biochemistry, general; Cell Biology; Immunology; Cell Culture; Antibodies","Department of Systems Biology, College of Life Science and Biotechnology, Yonsei University, Seoul, Korea; Department of Bioengineering, College of Engineering, Hanyang University, Seoul, Korea; Department of Bioengineering, College of Engineering, Hanyang University, Seoul, Korea; Department of Systems Biology, College of Life Science and Biotechnology, Yonsei University, Seoul, Korea"

However, little is known about the roles of circRNAs in the development and treatment of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL). Here we report the expression profiling and function of circRNAs in APL, including their dynamic regulation during alltrans retinoic acid (ATRA)induced differentiation. We performed two independent ribosomal RNAminus RNAsequencing (Ribominus RNAseq) experiments with and without RNase R treatment on APL patientderived NB4 cells and identified a total of 4313 circRNAs, including 1098 newly identified circRNAs. Detailed analysis showed that circRNAs expressed in APL cells were mostly exonderived, not byproducts during splicing, and could be distinguished from hematopoietic stem cells, neutrophils and lymphocytes. The true presence and stability of circRNAs were verified both in NB4 cells and primary APL patient samples. Moreover, we conducted a timeseries analysis of circRNAs on ATRAtreated NB4 cells and uncovered 508 circRNAs with dynamic expression during ATRA treatment, including 246 upregulated and 262 downregulated. Further evidence demonstrated that the majority of circRNAs were regulated independently of their host linear mRNAs. Detailed functional experiments demonstrated that circHIPK2, one of the differentially expressed circRNAs, significantly influenced ATRAinduced differentiation of APL cells. Further mechanistic studies revealed that circHIPK2 was located in cytoplasm and served as a sponge for differentiationassociated miR1243p. Finally, circHIPK2 expression in APL patients was significantly lower than that in normal peripheral mononuclear cells and other subtypes of AML, indicating its potential role as an APL biomarker. Our study indicates the biological functions of circRNAs in the development and treatment of APL, and provides a comprehensive circRNA resource for future studies.",Shufen Li; Yunlin Ma; Yun Tan; Xuefei Ma; Ming Zhao; Bing Chen; Rongsheng Zhang; Zhu Chen; Kankan Wang,"Life Sciences, general; Biochemistry, general; Cell Biology; Immunology; Cell Culture; Antibodies","State Key Laboratory of Medical Genomics, Ruijin Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China; SinoFrench Research Center for Life Sciences and Genomics, Ruijin Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China; State Key Laboratory of Medical Genomics, Ruijin Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China; State Key Laboratory of Medical Genomics, Ruijin Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China; State Key Laboratory of Medical Genomics, Ruijin Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China; State Key Laboratory of Medical Genomics, Ruijin Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China; State Key Laboratory of Medical Genomics, Ruijin Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China; State Key Laboratory of Medical Genomics, Ruijin Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China; State Key Laboratory of Medical Genomics, Ruijin Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China; SinoFrench Research Center for Life Sciences and Genomics, Ruijin Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China; State Key Laboratory of Medical Genomics, Ruijin Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China; SinoFrench Research Center for Life Sciences and Genomics, Ruijin Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China"

Here, we have identified a novel synthetic transstilbene compound, ZDAN11 ((Z)3(3, 4dimethoxyphenyl)2(3, 4, 5trimethoxyphenyl) acrylonitrile) which shows remarkable efficacy in blocking tumor growth and progression both in vitro and in vivo. ZDAN11 inhibits proliferation of cancer cells in vitro through microtubule depolymerization that induced G2M arrest and consequently leads to apoptotic cell death. More importantly, ZDAN11 shows limited cytotoxicity to normal cells as compared to cancer cells. Quite interestingly, we have found that ZDAN11mediated ROS production helps in dramatic alteration in the mitochondrial redox status which critically contributes to the apoptosis. Mechanistic studies reveal that ZDAN11 induces the expression of proapoptotic proteins and decreases antiapoptotic protein expression that decisively helps in the activation of caspase 8, caspase 9, and caspase 3, leading to cleavage of PARP1 and cell death via intrinsic and extrinsic pathways of apoptosis. Moreover, ZDAN11mediated apoptosis of cancer cells is through a partial p53dependent pathway, since both HCT116 p53 cells as well as p53silenced cells (siRNA) were able to block apoptosis partially but significantly. Importantly, ZDAN11 also imparts its antitumorigenic effect by inhibiting clonogenic property and anchorageindependent growth potential of cancer cells at concentrations at least 10 times lower than that required for inducing apoptosis. Finally, in vivo study with immunocompetent syngeneic mice shows ZDAN11 to be able to impede tumor progression without any adverse sideeffects. Hence, we identified a novel, synthetic transstilbene derivative with antitumorigenic potential which might tremendously help in devising potential therapeutic strategy against cancer.",Pravat Kumar Parida; Barun Mahata; Abhisek Santra; Sohini Chakraborty; Zhumur Ghosh; Sanghamitra Raha; Anup Kumar Misra; Kaushik Biswas; Kuladip Jana,"Life Sciences, general; Biochemistry, general; Cell Biology; Immunology; Cell Culture; Antibodies","Division of Molecular Medicine, Bose Institute, Kolkata, India; Division of Molecular Medicine, Bose Institute, Kolkata, India; Division of Molecular Medicine, Bose Institute, Kolkata, India; The Bioinformatics Center, Bose Institute, Kolkata, India; The Bioinformatics Center, Bose Institute, Kolkata, India; Saha Institute of Nuclear Physics, Kolkata, India; Division of Molecular Medicine, Bose Institute, Kolkata, India; Division of Molecular Medicine, Bose Institute, Kolkata, India; Division of Molecular Medicine, Bose Institute, Kolkata, India"
68912db8df7c4465bef27e65789c4013,OGlcNAc elevation through activation of the hexosamine biosynthetic pathway enhances cancer cell chemoresistance,"Chemoresistance has become a major obstacle to the success of cancer therapy, but the mechanisms underlying chemoresistance are not yet fully understood. OGlcNAcylation is a posttranslational modification that is regulated by the hexosamine biosynthetic pathway (HBP) and has an important role in a wide range of cellular functions. Here we assessed the role of OGlcNAcylation in chemoresistance and investigated the underlying cellular mechanisms. The results showed that the HBP has an important role in cancer cell chemoresistance by regulating OGlcNAcylation. An increase in the levels of OGlcNAcylation indicates an increased resistance of cancer cells to chemotherapy. Acute treatment with doxorubicin (DOX) or camptothecin (CPT) induced OGlcNAcylation through HBP activation. In fact, the chemotherapy agents activated the AKTXboxbinding protein 1 (XBP1) axis and then induced the HBP. Furthermore, the observed elevation of cellular OGlcNAcylation led to activation of survival signalling pathways and chemoresistance in cancer cells. Finally, suppression of OGlcNAcylation reduced the resistance of both established and primary cancer cells to chemotherapy. These results provide significant novel insights regarding the important role of the HBP and OGlcNAcylation in regulating cancer chemoresistance. Thus, OGlcNAc inhibition might offer a new strategy for improving the efficacy of chemotherapy.",Yubo Liu; Yu Cao; Xiaoqing Pan; Meiyun Shi; Qiong Wu; Tianmiao Huang; Hui Jiang; Wenli Li; Jianing Zhang,"Life Sciences, general; Biochemistry, general; Cell Biology; Immunology; Cell Culture; Antibodies","School of Life Science and Medicine, Dalian University of Technology, Panjin, China; School of Life Science and Medicine, Dalian University of Technology, Panjin, China; School of Life Science and Medicine, Dalian University of Technology, Panjin, China; School of Life Science and Medicine, Dalian University of Technology, Panjin, China; School of Life Science and Medicine, Dalian University of Technology, Panjin, China; School of Life Science and Medicine, Dalian University of Technology, Panjin, China; School of Life Science and Medicine, Dalian University of Technology, Panjin, China; School of Life Science and Medicine, Dalian University of Technology, Panjin, China; School of Life Science and Biotechnology, Dalian University of Technology, Dalian, China; School of Life Science and Medicine, Dalian University of Technology, Panjin, China"
0f77e3ca178146b9a1d46d1bd9b7340d,Cinacalcetmediated activation of the CaMKKLKB1AMPK pathway attenuates diabetic nephropathy in dbdb mice by modulation of apoptosis and autophagy,"Apoptosis and autophagy are harmoniously regulated biological processes for maintaining tissue homeostasis. AMPactivated protein kinase (AMPK) functions as a metabolic sensor to coordinate cellular survival and function in various organs, including the kidney. We investigated the renoprotective effects of cinacalcet in highglucose treated human glomerular endothelial cells (HGECs), murine podocytes and C57BLKSJdbdb mice. In cultured HGECs and podocytes, cinacalcet decreased oxidative stress and apoptosis and increased autophagy that were attributed to the increment of intracellular Ca2 concentration and the phosphorylation of Ca2calmodulindependent protein kinase kinase (CaMKK)Liver kinase B1 (LKB1)AMPK and their downstream signals including the phosphorylation of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) and increases in superoxide dismutases and B cell leukemialymphoma 2BCL2associated X protein expression. Interestingly, intracellular chelator BAPTAAM reversed cinacalcetinduced CaMKK elevation and LKB1 phosphorylation. Cinacalcet reduced albuminuria without influencing either blood glucose or Ca2 concentration and ameliorated diabetesinduced renal damage, which were related to the increased expression of calciumsensing receptor and the phosphorylation of CaMKKLKB1. Subsequent activation of AMPK was followed by the activation of peroxisome proliferatoractivated receptor  coactivator1 and phosphoSer1177eNOSnitric oxide, resulting in a decrease in apoptosis and oxidative stress as well as an increase in autophagy. Our results suggest that cinacalcet increases intracellular Ca2 followed by an activation of CaMKKLKB1AMPK signaling in GECs and podocytes in the kidney, which provides a novel therapeutic means for type 2 diabetic nephropathy by modulation of apoptosis and autophagy.",Ji Hee Lim; Hyung Wook Kim; Min Young Kim; Tae Woo Kim; Eun Nim Kim; Yaeni Kim; Sungjin Chung; Young Soo Kim; Bum Soon Choi; YongSoo Kim; Yoon Sik Chang; Hye Won Kim; Cheol Whee Park,"Life Sciences, general; Biochemistry, general; Cell Biology; Immunology; Cell Culture; Antibodies","Division of Nephrology, Department of Internal Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea; Institute for Aging and Metabolic Diseases, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea; Division of Nephrology, Department of Internal Medicine, St. Vincent's Hospital, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Suwon, Korea; Division of Nephrology, Department of Internal Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea; Institute for Aging and Metabolic Diseases, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea; Department of Hematology, Seoul St. Mary's Hospital, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea; Division of Nephrology, Department of Internal Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea; Division of Nephrology, Department of Internal Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea; Division of Nephrology, Department of Internal Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea; Division of Nephrology, Department of Internal Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea; Division of Nephrology, Department of Internal Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea; Division of Nephrology, Department of Internal Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea; Division of Nephrology, Department of Internal Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea; Department of Rehabilitation Medicine, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Bucheon, Korea; Division of Nephrology, Department of Internal Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea; Institute for Aging and Metabolic Diseases, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea"

Autophagy is indispensable in maintaining the metabolic activities of cells exposed to deleterious stress. The contribution of microRNA signaling to chondrocyte autophagy in OA development remains elusive. We uncovered an association between poor autophagy and increased miR128a expressions in articular chondrocytes of patients with endstage knee OA and in a rat anterior cruciate ligament transection (ACLT) model for OA development. Cartilage matrix degradation and severe OA histopathology was evident upon forced miR128a expression within the articular compartment. Intraarticular injections with miR128a antisense oligonucleotide stabilized chondrocyte autophagy and slowed ACLTmediated articular tissue destruction, including cartilage erosion, synovitis, osteophyte formation, and subchondral plate damage. In vitro, miR128 signaling hindered Atg12 expression, LC3II conversion, and autophagic puncta formation through targeting the 3untranslated region of Atg12. It increased apoptotic programs, diminishing cartilage formation capacity of articular chondrocytes. Inactivating histone methyltransferase EZH2 reduced methyl histone H3K27 enrichment in the miR128a promoter and upregulated miR128a transcription in inflamed chondrocytes. Taken together, miR128ainduced Atg12 loss repressed chondrocyte autophagy to aggravate OA progression. EZH2 inactivation caused H3K27 hypomethylation to accelerate miR128a actions. Interruption of miR128a signaling attenuated chondrocyte dysfunction and delayed OA development. Our data provide new insights into how miR128a signaling affects chondrocyte survival and articular cartilage anabolism and highlight the potential of miR128a targeting therapy to alleviate knee OA.",WeiShiung Lian; JihYang Ko; ReWeng Wu; YiChih Sun; YuShan Chen; ShinLong Wu; LinHsiu Weng; Holger Jahr; FengSheng Wang,"Life Sciences, general; Biochemistry, general; Cell Biology; Immunology; Cell Culture; Antibodies","Core Laboratory for Phenomics and Diagnostics, Kaohsiung Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, Kaohsiung, Taiwan; Department of Medical Research, Kaohsiung Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, Kaohsiung, Taiwan; Department of Orthopedic Surgery, Kaohsiung Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, Kaohsiung, Taiwan; Department of Orthopedic Surgery, Kaohsiung Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, Kaohsiung, Taiwan; Core Laboratory for Phenomics and Diagnostics, Kaohsiung Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, Kaohsiung, Taiwan; Department of Medical Research, Kaohsiung Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, Kaohsiung, Taiwan; Core Laboratory for Phenomics and Diagnostics, Kaohsiung Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, Kaohsiung, Taiwan; Department of Medical Research, Kaohsiung Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, Kaohsiung, Taiwan; Core Laboratory for Phenomics and Diagnostics, Kaohsiung Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, Kaohsiung, Taiwan; Department of Medical Research, Kaohsiung Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, Kaohsiung, Taiwan; Department of Orthopedic Surgery, Kaohsiung Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, Kaohsiung, Taiwan; Department of Anatomy and Cell Biology, University Hospital RWTH Aachen, Aachen, Germany; Department of Orthopaedics, University Hospital RWTH Aachen, Aachen, Germany; Core Laboratory for Phenomics and Diagnostics, Kaohsiung Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, Kaohsiung, Taiwan; Department of Medical Research, Kaohsiung Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, Kaohsiung, Taiwan; Graduate Institute of Clinical Medical Sciences, Chang Gung University College of Medicine, Kaohsiung, Taiwan"

However, the mechanisms underlying its development are still poorly understood. Thyroid hormone Receptor Interactor 13 (TRIP13) is a key mitosis regulator, and recent evidence has shown that it is an oncogene. Here, we report that TRIP13, which is overexpressed in CRC, is correlated with the CEA (carcinoembryonic antigen), CA199 (carbohydrate antigen 199) and pTNM (pathologic primary tumor, lymph nodes, distant metastasis) classification. Multivariate analyses showed that TRIP13 might serve as an independent prognostic marker of CRC. We also found that TRIP13 promoted CRC cell proliferation, invasion and migration in vitro and subcutaneous tumor formation in vivo. Furthermore, the potential mechanism underlying these effects involves the interaction of TRIP13 with a 1433 protein, YWHAZ, which mediates G2M transition and epithelialmesenchymal transition (EMT).

Here, we show that LncTim3 is upregulated and negatively correlates with IFN and IL2 production in tumorinfiltrating CD8 T cells of HCC patients. LncTim3 plays a pivotal role in stimulating CD8 T exhaustion and the survival of the exhausted CD8 T cells. Mechanistically, LncTim3 specifically binds to Tim3 and blocks its interaction with Bat3, thus suppressing downstream Lck NFAT1AP1 signaling, leading to nuclear localization of Bat3, and enhancing p300dependent p53 and RelA transcriptional activation of antiapoptosis genes including MDM2 and Bcl2. In summary, LncTim3 promotes T cell exhaustion, a phenotype which is correlated with compromised antitumor immunity, suggesting that LncTim3 and its associated signaling pathways may influence the outcome of cancer therapies aimed at modulating the acquired immune system.",Jie Ji; Yin Yin; Huanyu Ju; Xiaoliang Xu; Wei Liu; Qiang Fu; Jiaojiao Hu; Xudong Zhang; Beicheng Sun,"Life Sciences, general; Biochemistry, general; Cell Biology; Immunology; Cell Culture; Antibodies","Liver Transplantation Center of the First Affiliated Hospital and State Key Laboratory of Reproductive Medicine, Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, China; Liver Transplantation Center of the First Affiliated Hospital and State Key Laboratory of Reproductive Medicine, Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, China; Department of Laboratory Medicine, the First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, China; Liver Transplantation Center of the First Affiliated Hospital and State Key Laboratory of Reproductive Medicine, Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, China; Department of Gastroenterology, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, China; Department of Gastroenterology, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, China; Department of Gastroenterology, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, China; Department of General Surgery, The Affiliated Changzhou No.2 People's Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, China; Liver Transplantation Center of the First Affiliated Hospital and State Key Laboratory of Reproductive Medicine, Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, China"

In the current study, we made an investigation on the anticancer effect of glaucocalyxin A, a bioactive entkauranoid diterpenoid isolated from Rabdosia japonica var., and unraveled the underlying mechanisms. Here, we found that Glaucocalyxin A inhibited the cell viability of numerous osteosarcoma cells. Our results showed that Glaucocalyxin A exerted the proapoptotic effect on human osteosarcoma cells, MG63 and HOS cells. Glaucocalyxin A induced apoptosis by mitochondrial apoptotic pathway through several steps including increasing the BaxBcl2 ratio, triggering the intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, reducing mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), and inducing cleavage of caspase9 and caspase3. We demonstrated that Glaucocalyxin A induced apoptosis via inhibiting Fivezinc finger Glis 1 (GLI1) activation by overexpression and knockdown of GLI1 in vitro. We also found that Glaucocalyxin A inhibited GLI1 activation via regulating phosphatidylinositol 3 kinaseprotein kinase B (PI3KAkt) signaling pathway. We further confirmed our findings by using PI3K activator and inhibitor to verify the inhibitory effect of Glaucocalyxin A on PI3KAktGLI1 pathway. Moreover, our in vivo study revealed that glaucocalyxin A possessed a remarkable antitumor effect with no toxicity in the xenograft model inoculated with HOS tumor through the same mechanisms as in vitro. In conclusion, our results suggested that Glaucocalyxin A induced apoptosis in osteosarcoma by inhibiting nuclear translocation of GLI1 via regulating PI3KAkt signaling pathway.

Positive endexpiratory pressure (PEEP) was increased 2 cmH2O above the clinically set PEEP, then decreased by four 5min steps of 1 cmH2O, and restored at the clinical value. At each PEEP, FOT measurements were performed bedside during MV. Changes in respiratory mechanics with PEEP, clinical parameters, and chest radiographs were evaluated. Twentytwo newborns (244  14 wks gestational age (GA); birth weight 653  166 g) on assistcontrol ventilation were studied. Infants were ventilated for 40  36 d (range 1155 d), 11 developed severe bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) and one died before 28 d. Early lung mechanics correlated with days on MV, days of respiratory support, and BPD grade. Effects of increasing PEEP on oscillatory reactance assessed by FOT together with GA and radiographic score predicted days on MV (multilinear model, r2  0.73).

Clinical investigations must have good precision and diagnostic accuracy before widespread use in clinical practice. Transient elastography (TE) measures liver stiffness, a surrogate marker of liver fibrosis in adults and children. Studies to evaluate its repeatability and reproducibility (precision) in children are limited. Our aim was to determine (i) the normal range of TE measurements and (ii) the repeatability and reproducibility of TE in healthy children. TE was performed in 257 healthy children, of whom 235 (91%, mean age 11.7 years, standard deviation (SD) 2.51, 107 were males (45.5%)) had two valid TE measurements performed, at least 24 h apart, by two operators under similar circumstances. Highquality TE images were obtained for each examination. The normal range of TE was 2.886.52 kPa. The mean difference between paired measurements was 0.044 (SD 0.4). The 95% limits of agreement ranged from 0.8 to 0.76 kPa for repeat measurements. There was a difference of 1 kPa between measurements in 61235 (25.9%) children. The lack of precision was similar across all age groups. This study demonstrates that TE does not have acceptable precision in healthy children, because random measurement variation results in the lack of agreement between paired measurements.

In addition to medications, physical therapy is considered as a treatment strategy for asthma. We conducted this study to investigate the effects of physical therapy on lung function in children with asthma. Three databases were searched. We conducted the metaanalysis for the forced expiratory volume in the first second in percent predicted values FEV1(%pred)], the forced vital capacity in percent predicted values FVC(%pred)], and the peak expiratory flow in percent predicted values PEF(%pred)] by using a random effect model. Of the 6474 identified studies, 18 studies (16 in physical training, 2 in breathing exercise or inspiratory muscle training) were included in the systematic review and 11 studies (all in physical training) were included in the metaanalysis. The metaanalysis showed a significantly improved FVC(%pred) in the experimental group. Physical training improved FVC(%pred) significantly in children with asthma. Further study is needed, especially on the effects of breathing exercise and inspiratory muscle training in children with asthma.

Using the Kids' Inpatient Database for 20062012, we identified patients (21 years) with a CD diagnosis. Cases were analyzed and stratified by median parental income by zip code. Multivariable logistic regression was performed. Of the 28,337 pediatric CD hospitalizations identified, patients were more likely male (51.1%), nonHispanic white (71.3%), and had a mean age of 15.9 years. The proportion of minority patients increased as income quartile declined. Higher income quartile patients were more likely to be coded with anxiety and less likely with anemia. The highest income quartile was more likely to have a bowel obstruction, and peritonealintestinal abscess and was also 28% more likely to undergo a major surgical procedure. Significant variability exists in the reported comorbidities and surgical interventions associated with CD by income quartile. Lower income quartile patients are more likely to be of minority ethnicity and anemic, but less likely to undergo a major surgical procedure. Further investigation is warranted to determine whether these differences represent disease variability, differences in healthcare resource allocation, or implicit bias in management.

This study aims to report outcomes, with focus on CLD, of preterm infants managed with a bubble CPAP (bCPAP) bundle of care. Infants 1500 g were stratified into four groups depending on intubation status through first 3 days of life. The incidence of mortality, CLD and other morbidities were compared over four chronological epochs. Outcomes of the most recent epoch were compared to contemporaneous benchmarks from Vermont Oxford Network (VON). Of 773 infants (median GA  28 weeks, average BW  995 g), 24.5% were intubated in DR and 11.7% in the first day of life. Mechanical ventilation, bCPAP and oxygen days in survivors were 1.5, 29 and 14, respectively. Overall incidence of CLD was 6.4% that remained consistent in the four epochs (7.6%, 7.5%, 5.8% and 5%), respectively. In comparison to VON, CLD was significantly less (p  0.001). Initial DR intubation was not associated with increased CLD compared to initial management with CPAP that required subsequent intubation. It is feasible and sustainable to administer a bCPAP bundle of care to decrease CLD. Cluster randomized trials are needed to validate the reproducibility of this approach.",Hany Aly; Mohamed A.
